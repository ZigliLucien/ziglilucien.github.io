                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Early Prime Day tablet deals are already starting to go live, which is perfect for those who can't wait until the official sale launches on October 7th. Weeks ahead of the next installment of Prime Day, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon's Fire HD 10 tablet has slid back down to 36% off</strong></a>, making the lockscreen ad version just $90 for members.</p><p>Those who don't want the lockscreen ads, can pay to have them removed at the time of purchase or later on. Additionally, while this sale is for the base-level, 32GB edition of the tablet, you can also get the 64GB version for 44% off and just $10 more.</p><p>In any case, we think the Fire HD 10 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet#section-best-tablet-for-sharing">best Fire tablet for sharing</a>, partially because it's a solid, affordable Amazon device with easy Alexa compatibility, parental controls, and a wide range of apps. Named for its touchscreen display of slightly over 10 inches, users get a Full HD resolution, around 13 hours of battery life, built-in Dolby Atmos speakers, and more—all for under $100 with this discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="tFdGigaioQMRvyNUzpN6k" name="123 1.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tFdGigaioQMRvyNUzpN6k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Fire HD 10:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension25=""> <del>$139.99</del> <strong>$89.99 for Amazon's Early Prime Day Deals</strong></a></p><p>Amazon's Prime Day event <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-amazon-prime-day-big-deal-days-faq-2025">is confirmed</a> for October 7 and 8, but weeks ahead of that, the retailer has launched a familiar deal: 36% off the price of the Fire HD 10 tablet. We like this tablet for its affordability (especially as it regularly gets discounted), as well as its decent-looking, 10.1-inch touchscreen. It's certainly no premium tablet, but it's a good, affordable addition to any Alexa smart home household, or to families who are looking for budget-friendly versatility.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a cheap tablet deal with easy access to Alexa voice assistance; you're planning on getting a tablet that can be used as a shared device, potentially including parental controls for family use; you want a tablet for under $100 that will still get the job done and offer decent battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a premium-level tablet and you need high-level performance or an AMOLED screen; you need your tablet to have high-res cameras for meetings, photos, or videos; you aren't otherwise an Alexa user and you might prefer a device compatible with another digital ecosystem, such as Samsung or Google.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-10-2023-launch">Amazon Fire HD 10</a> is our favorite Fire tablet for sharing, and there's more than one reason why. The latest generation of the lineup offers a decent 10.1-inch Full HD display, and either 32GB or 64GB storage options, both of which are on sale at the time of writing.</p><p>Plus, it comes with a built-in mic, speakers, and a 5MP selfie cam that's good enough for basic video calling (though it may not be the top pick for high-level professional meetings).</p><p>For those who need more than 64GB of storage, the HD 10 also comes with a microSD port that will allow users to get up to 1TB of expandable storage. Performance is backed by a 2x Arm Cortex-A76 Octa-Core processor and 3GB of RAM, which isn't much but should allow some multi-tasking.</p><p>Overall, it's not a bad pick for under $100, but if you can hold out for the official Prime Day sale, we can probably expect to see an even bigger discount.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Starting with the former, Gemini Live is now capable of using your camera to peer into the real world for assistance.

Not every Android and iOS device sports this visual assistance through Gemini Live, but Google says that's "coming soon."</p><p>For the fun times, Nano Banana has been making headlines in September. The powerful image editor within the Gemini app, which leverages Google's DeepMind, lets users get extremely whacky with their ideas, and let Gemini do the rest. There are several "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-nano-banana-examples/">use cases</a>" that have stood out this month, such as turning a photo of a cat into a pixel-world video game.</p><p>Custom Gems you've created through Gemini can now be shared, as well as using the AI in Canvas to create an app "with no coding experience." Google also highlights a major update headed for Chrome.

Make sure to <a href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect 2025</a>, there's real buzz around the company that we haven't seen in Silicon Valley in a while. Meta is looking for its iPhone moment with a metaverse strategy involving VR, AR, and smart glasses, and it might just have one. Products like Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta shades are flying off the shelves, and are even starting to get mainstream attention.</p><p>A lineup of smart glasses once confined to a few Ray-Ban styles now includes new products such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a>, Oakley Meta Vanguard, and Ray-Ban Meta Display. Meta's smart glasses product offerings are becoming more varied and attainable in every way but one: accessibility. You can choose to get Meta tech in a growing assortment of eyewear brands, frames, and styles, but if your eye prescription isn't supported, you might be out of look.</p><p>To be clear, Meta is doing amazing things with accessibility for people with low vision and blindness. Be My Eyes support and commands like "Hey Meta, look and describe" use the cameras onboard smart glasses and AI to provide audio descriptions of the real world to people who couldn't otherwise see them. It's some of the most exciting accessibility technology available, powered by Meta glasses.</p><p>However, there's a community somewhere in the middle that's being underserved by Meta and its partner EssilorLuxottica. All of Meta's smart glasses have low prescription ranges, from the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a> to the latest Ray-Ban Meta Display. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">I fell outside those ranges in 2024</a>, and after a year of waiting for Meta to improve its offerings, I'm taking matters into my own hands and ordering custom lenses elsewhere.</p><h2 id="why-meta-s-supported-prescription-ranges-aren-t-cutting-it-2">Why Meta's supported prescription ranges aren't cutting it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WfJwTcTyjYj89WX4AsjAHg" name="Meta-2025-new-glasses-4" alt="Three Oakley Meta HSTN, three Oakley Meta Vanguard, and three Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), along with cases, sitting atop a table in various styles, along with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses in front of them all." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WfJwTcTyjYj89WX4AsjAHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Officially, Meta supports prescription lenses between -6.00 to +4.00 total power on the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN. For Meta Ray-Ban Display, the prescription range is even tighter, between -4.00 to +4.00 total power. While this might feel like a step backward, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> has a screen built into the right lens, presumably adding technical limitations to supporting higher-strength eye prescriptions.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> isn't available with prescription lenses at all; that isn't surprising because neither are the Oakley Sphaera frames they are based on. However, there are third-party prescription inserts available for Sphaera, so it'll be interesting to see whether they pop up for Vanguard in the future.</p><p>The reason why I'm tough on Meta for its limited support for prescription lenses is that it's an easy problem to solve. Using high-index lenses, higher prescriptions outside of Meta's currently-supported range can be made thinner, fitting into frames like Meta Ray-Ban and Meta Oakley HSTN.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ragZ7MhkemnCMNPXsKVXzP" name="Oakley-Meta-HSTN-display-shelf" alt="A photo of the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses on display in all five styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ragZ7MhkemnCMNPXsKVXzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta competitors, such as Solos, offer a much wider prescription strength range of -15.00 to +10.00 when using these thin lenses. Additionally, third-party sites like GlassesUSA and Lensology are filling the gap by making custom lenses for prescriptions beyond what Meta provides through its own online shop and partner retailers.</p><p>I was hoping that, since the prescription lens problem was seemingly solved by third parties, Meta would expand support for a wider variety of prescription needs with its latest round of smart glasses announcements. There were even pre-Connect rumors of Meta glasses designed specifically for prescription lenses. Unfortunately, that didn't happen — the supported range stayed the same for Meta's basic smart glasses, and shrunk for the new display version.</p><p>I'm not sure what the holdup is for Meta in addressing this key limitation, but after waiting through the Oakley Meta launch and Connect 2025, I've decided to stop holding my breath and purchase lenses via a third-party instead.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Meta for comment regarding its prescription lens support for smart glasses and its future plans, but the company didn't immediately respond. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="why-i-m-not-waiting-and-you-shouldn-t-either-2">Why I'm not waiting, and you shouldn't either</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7FLKzcwSjXViD4QwaJQgmc" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-side-01" alt="Transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with transitions lenses from the side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7FLKzcwSjXViD4QwaJQgmc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If smart glasses are truly the future, manufacturers need to do everything they can to make them accessible to everyone. That includes people with vision correction needs who can't or don't want to wear contacts. All tech should be accessible, but if smart glasses really are the future of communication and productivity, there's even more pressure to make the form factor work for everyone.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, said during a 2025 earnings call that people without smart glasses would be at "a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people" in the future (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-people-without-ai-glasses-will-be-at-a-disadvantage-in-the-future/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). That kind of language puts smart glasses in the realm of necessity rather than luxury, meaning that people needing glasses for basic sight shouldn't have to wait for them to become <em>smart</em>.</p><p>Instead, I ordered Oakley Meta HSTN and prescription lenses from Lensology separately to get the experience in the here and now. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lensology.co.uk" target="_blank">Lensology</a> is a lens crafter based in the U.K. that specializes in "click and fit" service — you order custom lenses online and pop them into your frames when they show up at your door. I uploaded my prescription, picked Transitions lenses, and placed my order.</p><p>If all goes well, in a week or two, I'll have my prescription Oakley Meta HSTN glasses ready to wear — despite my vision-correction needs being unsupported by official Meta retail channels. While I still hope Meta one day expands its prescription lens offerings, people shouldn't have to wait to experience this essential tech, and they don't have to thanks to services like Lensology.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="80024167-89bf-44ed-b0b9-03b7d3bdaa3e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QR2XTuj5vdUaC8ZbiHtMM.jpg' alt="An official product render of brown Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with its charging case"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Great smart glasses...</strong></em></p><p>...if you don't need prescription lenses or your needs fall within the supported range.

And it all starts with the most "basic" of factors, as there are few companies that can release devices that are as premium as these.</p><p>You may have a hard time telling this version from its predecessor, but that's not a detriment when we're talking about ultra-thin tablets housed in a sleek aluminum and glass design. What's also impressive is that Samsung managed to make the 14.6-inch Tab S11 Ultra even thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a>, now matching up with Apple's 13-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">M4 iPad Pro</a>.

With the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra, Samsung is finally implementing some useful features, specifically with DeX. Instead of fiddling around with USB-C capture cards and adapters, "Extended Mode" lets you plug your tablet into a monitor and have the screen extended.</p><p>One feature I'm excited to get my hands on is the ability to create different "workspaces" when using DeX. Essentially, this lets you create four virtual desktops, each of which housing apps of your choosing. For example, I can have one workspace for my fantasy football apps, while another one might have Obsidian, Gmail, and Chrome.</p><p>I've been hoping to see such a feature introduced, as I usually have multiple desktops and spaces set up on my desktop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, and other computers. And with a tablet as large as the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, it truly gives you that laptop-like feeling.</p><h2 id="reasons-why-you-might-want-to-think-twice-2">Reasons why you might want to think twice</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no preamble here; the price is the biggest hurdle to overcome with the Tab S11 lineup, especially if you have the Tab S10 Plus or Ultra. The Tab S11 is a little bit of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/thinking-of-buying-a-galaxy-tab-s11-first-take-a-look-at-these-other-samsung-tablets">easier pill to swallow</a>, coming in at $799 in its base configuration. But the Tab S11 Ultra and its $1,199 price tag definitely make it more of a "luxury" purchase than anything else.</p><p>For just about the same price, you can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on">Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14</a> or the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-makes-a-splash-at-ifa-2025-with-the-chromebook-plus-spin-514-and-new-chromeboxes">Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514</a>, and the newly released Pixel 10. Both Lenovo's and Acer's latest Chromebooks are some of the best we've ever seen, thanks to the Kompanio Ultra chip. Plus, who doesn't love getting a new phone, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> might not be as feature-rich as the Pixel 10 Pro or Pro XL, it's no slouch either.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8zgSh9N66GgEC357xrXt7o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-7" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 on a desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8zgSh9N66GgEC357xrXt7o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Part of the reason why I bring up the Chromebook is that if you opt for the tablet approach, all you're getting from Samsung is the tablet and an S Pen. Meaning that if you want a tablet that doubles as a portable workstation, you'll need to pay even more to grab a keyboard case.</p><p>Not to mention that, unlike the Tab S11, Samsung has yet to release a successor to the Book Cover Keyboard that includes the trackpad. Currently, only the Book Cover Keyboard Slim is available, which has limited viewing angles and lacks a trackpad.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">tri-folding Mate XT</a> is the coolest phone I used, and while I was initially worried about its durability, that hasn't proven to be an issue. Similarly, Huawei's tablets are increasingly gaining momentum, and I thoroughly enjoyed using the MatePad 11.5 S and MatePad Pro 12.2.</p><p>But it's with wearables and audio products where the brand has the most potential. While the inability to use Google's services — including the Play Store — is a hindrance on phones and tablets, it isn't anywhere as much of a limitation on a smartwatch. And with the Watch Ultimate 2, Huawei is proving that it can deliver a smartwatch that outmatches the best its rivals have to offer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YRF53rg9C2xHB7RWarm3pQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRF53rg9C2xHB7RWarm3pQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Watch Ultimate 2 isn't markedly different to its predecessor, with Huawei instead making useful tweaks around battery life and polishing the design. The smartwatch is going on sale alongside the Watch GT 6 and GT 6 Pro, and is coming to several global markets, including the U.K. The Watch Ultimate 2 is debuting at €999 ($1,175) for the blue model (which I'm using), and there's a black model that costs €899 ($1,057) — similar to the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and €200 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</a>.</p><h2 id="design-that-s-built-to-stand-out-2">Design that's built to stand out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="f7Wi4B9fe7JCtgfQDdeeEQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7Wi4B9fe7JCtgfQDdeeEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We need to start with the design, because the Watch Ultimate 2 has a domineering presence; the massive 48.5mm watch case is designed to grab attention, and the smartwatch is available in two models: a black option, and a blue variant. The blue color has a dual-tone effect with white undertones, and it makes the watch stand out even more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x6SUrC8r45cqS2H7iAsbuP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6SUrC8r45cqS2H7iAsbuP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Watch Ultimate 2 has a woven fluoroelastomer band (in blue and white) as standard, and Huawei also includes a metal band in the box if you need to switch it out. Either band is of a high quality, and feel great to use. Interestingly, there's a bigger fluoroelastomer band bundled with the box that's designed to be used while diving, and the oversized design is meant to go over a wetsuit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7r8VuC65Hxxo2j74zAfSwP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7r8VuC65Hxxo2j74zAfSwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 48.5mm sizing dwarfs every other smartwatch, and even against the Garmin Fenix 8, the Watch Ultimate 2 looks outsized. I prefer wearing bigger watches, and the Watch Ultimate 2 definitely delivers on that front. The watch gets an octagonal design that's an evolution from last year, with the chassis made out of an zirconium alloy and the bezel featuring ceramic.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oF7SHB72jkPLdpT8ea2SnP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oF7SHB72jkPLdpT8ea2SnP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4896" height="2758" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bezel includes the name of the watch quite prominently — there's no mistaking that from the design anyway. There are three buttons, with one on the left and two to the right. The bottom button on the right serves as a shortcut, allowing you to pull up health data, make calls, or initiate a workout.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hhX4oA5Xah3E7GyBDM6KtP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhX4oA5Xah3E7GyBDM6KtP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The button up top has a built-in crown, and is used for navigating the interface. There's good feedback while navigating with the crown, and there's no lag in general. The Watch Ultimate 2 has a 1.5-inch OLED panel that's the same size as last year, and it gets LTPO 2 tech. It goes up to a maximum of 3,500 nits, which is a bit excessive. I didn't see any issues using the Watch Ultimate 2 outdoors even under harsh sunlight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4658px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YQ4Z7f4jzwsfWzd6VHqcwP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YQ4Z7f4jzwsfWzd6VHqcwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4658" height="2624" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 466 x 466 resolution is decent enough, and the size of the panel means there are no issues viewing incoming notifications from the phone. There's a good selection of watch faces, and while the inherent customizability isn't as high as other Android smartwatches, you get a good mix of choices.</p><h2 id="this-smartwatch-is-built-to-last-2">This smartwatch is built to last</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5129px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LfVSwWk3yEkoHDCxkFhayP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LfVSwWk3yEkoHDCxkFhayP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5129" height="2889" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with other high-end smartwatches, the Watch Ultimate 2 is designed to be rugged; it works as a diving watch up to 150 meters thanks to 20 ATM water resistance. Interestingly, the techniques Huawei designed to make the watch resilient to the pressure at 150 meters allows it to withstand daily rigors much better, including soapy water and seawater ingress. Also, it has a sonar device that sends out audio pulses; obviously, I wasn't about to go diving just to test the feature, but Huawei has an above-water testing mode that lets you use it, which is just plain cool.</p><p>Golf is a big part of the smartwatch's differentiation, with Huawei providing useful guidance and course-related details. Huawei added a new antenna in the Watch Ultimate 2 with better signal strength and dual-band GPS, giving it better accuracy while on a trail or running outdoors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="aYRmstNv9eEBDGJppdBKJQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aYRmstNv9eEBDGJppdBKJQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Health monitoring is a core tenet of any smartwatch, and the Watch Ultimate 2 uses Huawei's new TruSense system that consists of an ECG, PPG, and pressure sensors.

The UI is fluid and easy to navigate, and there's plenty of customizability. One issue is that you'll need to sideload Huawei Health if you're using a Pixel device like I am; it was a bit of a hassle to get the app installed on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>. This isn't a problem if you're using a Samsung, Vivo, OPPO, or Xiaomi phone, as those devices have Huawei Health in their app stores.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="f9Nai7VUNMFV7yiUnLLqzP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f9Nai7VUNMFV7yiUnLLqzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only other problem is that I wasn't able to add my cards to the smartwatch, but that could just be down to me being in India. Otherwise, it has been enjoyable to use the Watch Ultimate 2, and it is better than the Galaxy Watch Ultra in daily use. I got better battery life as well, with the watch easily lasting over two days even with heavy use, extending to three days with medium use. That's a huge uptick from most smartwatches I have on hand, and only the Fenix 8 lasts longer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SFViTuN3eJ2jcLC7cDMgbQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SFViTuN3eJ2jcLC7cDMgbQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the Watch Ultimate 2 is a terrific choice if you need a high-end smartwatch that's loaded with features.

Make sure to <a href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>When Google first revealed the Pixel 10 series, most applauded the Android brand for being the first mainstream one to adopt Qi2 magnets. Others celebrated the improved Tensor G5 processor, the faster charging, or the larger battery capacities. Overall, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> seemed like a hit, but I was skeptical for one reason: the thickness and weight of the device.</p><p>Google Pixel phones have long jam-packed features and battery life into chunky form factors, but the Pixel 10 Pro felt like a step too far. At 8.6mm thick and weighing 207 grams, the Pixel 10 Pro dwarfed competing options from Samsung and Apple, adding a tenth of a millimeter and seven grams to the already-huge Pixel 9 Pro. To me, it was a dealbreaker.</p><p>Then, Apple did the unexpected and made the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max thicker and heavier than basically any competitor on the market — including the Pixel 10 Pro and XL, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. I haven't exactly changed my tune, but the iPhone 17 Pro series' gargantuan dimensions have certainly made me appreciate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">the Pixel 10 Pro and XL models</a> more.</p><h2 id="iphone-air-is-hiding-the-iphone-17-pro-s-shockingly-large-build-2">iPhone Air is hiding the iPhone 17 Pro's shockingly-large build</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="3rqyCcc5VC3ZMpBFBFmmqh" name="iPhone-17-Pro-side-view" alt="Side view of the iPhone 17 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3rqyCcc5VC3ZMpBFBFmmqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1197" height="673" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're only now hearing about how huge the iPhone 17 Pro is, you're not alone. We've all been laser-focused on the iPhone Air and its polarizing nature, and that has let Apple's moves on the Pro models fly under the radar. Here's the rundown: both the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max measure 8.75mm, making them the thickest iPhones since the iPhone 5c released way back in 2013.</p><p>That doesn't include the camera <em>plateau</em>, which adds extra thickness to the overall package. Apple also added eight grams to the weight of the iPhone 17 Pro and six grams to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. In other words, these are absolutely humongous smartphones that will take up a ton of space in your hands, pockets, or bags. Compared to the 8.25mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max</a>, this is a drastic change.</p><p>I'm all for consumer choice, and there are people who'll be thrilled that the Pro models are packed with more features and more battery. There's the iPhone Air for people like me, who crave a thin and lightweight package.

On paper, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro have quite a bit in common — similar battery capacities, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnets</a>, and a triple-camera rear system — and yet the Pixel 10 Pro manages to be thinner and lighter.</p><p>Put simply, it makes the Pixel 10 Pro and XL look like a much more impressive design and engineering feat than they appeared just a month prior. Thinner and lighter flagship phones, like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, lack <em>something </em>that explains the discrepancy, such as magnets. Google has nearly everything Apple put in the iPhone 17 Pro, while undercutting its size and weight.</p><p>Both phones are still probably too thick and heavy for what I'd prefer to carry on a daily basis. But if you're like me and initially scoffed at the form factor and heft of Google's new phones, maybe the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max give you a better appreciation for the Pixel 10 Pro and XL.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c511ad96-db7c-49ba-8f0a-31fe8b6fd3fb">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A sneaky contender</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro isn't nearly as thin as I'd like, but it handily clears the iPhone 17 Pro when it comes to thickness and weight.

However, the company is now dipping its toes into the budget market with the announcement of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-Pocket-AIR-Mini">Pocket AIR Mini</a>.</p><p>We first learned about the handheld in early September, with only a handful of details being shared. Until now, we knew that it would share the same design as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-air-review">Pocket AIR</a>, an Android gaming handheld from 2023. AYANEO also touted the Mini as being the "world's first handheld with a brand-new 4:3 retro display."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jpmnTrlu3k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>With the launches of the Pocket DS and KONKR Pocket FIT out of the way, AYANEO pulled back the curtains on what the Pocket AIR Mini aims to offer. More than anything else, the most surprising aspect of the reveal was that the AIR Mini will start at just $89 for the base model. But for a limited time once pre-orders open, you'll be able to snag one for just $69.</p><p>When you take a look at the other AYANEO handhelds announced this year, it's immediately apparent why this is a big deal. For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneo-pocket-s2-and-s2-pro-pre-orders-are-now-open-with-shipping-to-begin-soon">Pocket S2</a>, powered by the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, starts at $499. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ace-is-compact-powerful-and-i-cant-wait">Pocket ACE</a>, with its G3x Gen 2 chip, retails for $389 in its base configuration, and of course, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-ds-pricing-announced-along-with-a-few-surprises">Pocket DS</a> will set you back $519 once its released.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wc8FyFmpmS5pWVsLSXbPB4" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-mini-color-options-render" alt="AYANEO Pocket AIR Mini color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wc8FyFmpmS5pWVsLSXbPB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, AYANEO is apparently setting out to change the narrative as we get closer to the end of the year. The company's most recent Android handheld, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneos-konkr-pocket-fit-elite-could-set-the-bar-for-android-gaming-handhelds">KONKR Pocket FIT</a>, is actually the first from a new "budget-minded lineup. It's powered by either the G3 Gen 3, or the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and starts at either $299 or $329.</p><p>That said, the Pocket AIR Mini is an even further drop down the price bracket, and we mostly have the processor to thank. AYANEO is dipping back into the MediaTek well and pulling out an oldie, as the Helio G90T will power the AIR Mini. This offers slightly less performance than even the Helio G99, the same SoC found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-micro-review">Pocket Micro</a> and Pocket Micro Classic.</p><p>Here's how the rest of the specs shake out:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>AYANEO Pocket AIR Mini</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>4.2-inch LCD, 1280 x 960, 4:3, 60Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Helio G90T</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>GPU</p></td><td  ><p>Mali-G76 MP4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>2GB / 3GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB / 64GB + microSD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4500mAh, 18W Charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Extras</p></td><td  ><p>Hall Sticks and Triggers, Audio vibration, Custom Performance Modes, Active Cooling</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Retro White, Aurora Black, Retro Power</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see, the specs aren't really all that impressive at first glance.

Now, according to a recent report, Samsung will be bringing this new form factor to the U.S. market. A "person familiar with the company's plans" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/18/tech/samsung-trifold-phone-galaxy-s26-edge">told CNN</a> that the U.S. has been a part of their launch discussions.</p><p>Samsung was rumored to launch its Trifold phone only in South Korea first, before expanding it across other regions based on how the phone fares in the domestic market. The company has historically introduced new devices, such as the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6"> Galaxy Z Fold 6 special edition</a>, or an experimental device in limited markets like South Korea and China, before a wider release.</p><p>However, it could be switching things up with the Trifold by simultaneously launching it in both its home market and the U.S., rather than staggering the release.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="unfolded form of the Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1595" height="897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-trifolding-phone-might-debut-as-soon-as-this-month">launch rumors</a> about the "Galaxy Z TriFold" suggest that Samsung is planning to host another Galaxy Unpacked event in South Korea on September 29 to introduce some new devices. The leak claims that Samsung will also launch its first-ever XR headset (codenamed Project Moohan) and its first pair of AI glasses, reportedly called Galaxy Glasses, during the event.</p><p>As for launching the TriFold in the U.S., Samsung could be trying to one-up Apple, as it is yet to launch a foldable, while this Korean OEM is ready to bring out a device that folds not just once, but inward from both sides, and not bringing it to a wider market would be a shame.</p><p>We haven't seen official renders or even leaks of the Galaxy Z TriFold; however, animation videos have been popping up quite a bit. The recent one shows the device sporting a U-shaped fold, all but confirming that Samsung’s Trifold features a central cover display flanked by two panels that fold around it. The animation also shows another interesting detail about the alleged cameras on the device, which lets you shoot selfies with the main rear cameras.</p><p>In terms of design, it is said to sport a titanium frame, 16GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon chipset, and without a doubt, it will come with a hefty price tag. We are still seeing conflicting launch details, with some suggesting the end of this month, while others say the trifold will arrive only in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Vats explicitly states that these are the "first test builds" Samsung has crafted using its latest flagship series. The builds bear version numbers S938BXXU5CYIA, S938BOXM5CYIA, and S938BXXU5CYIA for the S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra.</p><p>While some users in the thread are holding out hope for a public One UI 8.5 beta, Vats expresses uncertainty.</p><p>There's not much else to dissect about this, as Samsung's only getting started with the 0.5 addition to its One UI 8 software. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-ultra-first-one-ui-8-5-firmware/">SamMobile</a> theorizes that we likely won't see this update roll out until next year, when Samsung is expected to launch its Galaxy S26 series.

This update was speculated to bring "large improvements" to the Galaxy S26 series. Tipsters stated that the supposed existence of an 8.5 would bring more substantial updates to Samsung's Galaxy devices over a smaller, iterative "8.1" patch.</p><p>The assumptions didn't stop there, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-finally-make-swipe-navigation-the-default-setup-option-on-new-phones">as another rumor</a> states One UI 8.5 could bring the option to choose between gesture and button navigation during your initial device startup. The choices could be given on a dedicated splash screen, with each option available to tap before moving on to other new device setup items. Currently, after turning on your Galaxy device for the first time, you need to dive into its Settings to change your navigational preference.</p><p>This change would be a welcome one if Samsung is truly looking to do so.</p><p>We're putting One UI 8.5 to the side for now and getting starry-eyed at Samsung's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-expands-finally-for-galaxy-s25-and-foldables-ai-features-and-enhanced-security">official launch of One UI 8</a> (Android 16).

To begin, the patch reportedly adds the option for Kindle users to alter the font size of their device's UI.</p><p>The publication spotted this new capability in the Screen and Brightness settings.</p><p>When it comes to reading, the newest patch is rolling out a text spacing settings option. Sometimes the spacing of sentences on the page helps with readability, which is what Amazon's update aims to help users with. The post states that, within the "Aa" settings menu of an ebook, users can edit the line, paragraph, word, and character spacing. Users can even lock their Kindle in portrait or landscape mode, so your reading material doesn't morph on you when you're getting comfortable in that blanket.</p><p>While those feature additions are the core of this new update this month, the publication highlights an expansion of Amazon's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=122146457011">Kindle Assistive Reader</a>.

I like that the brand ported the design aesthetic into a smaller form factor, and the metal grille at the front with the embossed Marshall logo allows the Emberton III to stand out visually.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="vKghGtdXfqVPE2ecECiVj5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKghGtdXfqVPE2ecECiVj5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But you're not buying it for the looks; the sound quality is where the Emberton III comes into its own. The speaker produces 20W of sound via two 10W full-range drivers, and there are dual passive radiators as well. Now, 20W may not seem like a lot when there are portable speakers like the Tribit StormBox Blast 2 that go up to 200W, but the Emberton III cleverly utilizes the internal design to produce a much louder sound than the hardware suggests.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="taVrkrSFcNsqFpNiHQKaa5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/taVrkrSFcNsqFpNiHQKaa5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The result is that the Emberton III punches well above its weight when it comes to how loud it gets; most of the time, I didn't have to increase the volume beyond 60%. The sound quality is quintessential Marshall; there's a pronounced bass with a tight sub-bass that sounds delightful, detailed mid-range that lets vocals and ensemble instruments shine, and clean treble without any sibilance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="t7W98pLjkUzvq3ayHS6zm4" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7W98pLjkUzvq3ayHS6zm4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4822" height="2716" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The drivers are angled within the chassis, so you get a stereo soundstage that's immersive. While there are no toggles to change the bass and treble levels like on the Stanmore, you can use the Marshall app to switch between three EQ modes. It isn't as configurable, but if you need to double down on the bass, there's an EQ setting that lets you do just that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rq2asogojbiGY8oXwgRtE5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rq2asogojbiGY8oXwgRtE5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, the Emberton III sounds as good as it looks, and I was constantly impressed by its performance in this area. It's hard to pull off something like this in an enclosure that's just 160mm wide and 1.2lb in weight, and Marshall did a terrific job overall. The smaller size makes it easier to take the Emberton III anywhere, and the design is clearly built to last. The speaker took its share of tumbles in the last two months, and it came away unscathed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CUbSYknbmZDoWu2tFgCEf5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CUbSYknbmZDoWu2tFgCEf5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are other niceties; the Emberton III gets IP67 ingress protection, making it ideal to use at the pool or the shower. There's a built-in mic that lets you take calls on the speaker, and that's a decent addition. You also get good onboard controls; there's a multi-function knob at the top that lets you adjust volume, play or pause media, and go forward or back. The dedicated Bluetooth button puts the Emberton III into pairing mode, you get a power button, and there's a battery life indicator.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MNxUhw9zz4obyd7KM95kE5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MNxUhw9zz4obyd7KM95kE5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life is pretty great too; I got over 24 hours of use with the volume turned up, and that's better than most other speakers in this category. It takes just over two hours to charge the battery via USB-C, and fast charging delivers up to six hours of music playback with a 20-minute charge.</p><p>It connects over Bluetooth 5.3, and I didn't see any problems with range or connectivity. I used the Emberton III with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, and a slew of Android phones.

The smaller size means you can take it anywhere, and the durable design combined with IP67 dust and water resistance makes it weather just about any environment.</p><p>The sound quality is where the Emberton III excels over other products I used in the last 12 months; it gets louder, more detailed, and delivers a surprising amount of sound considering the size of the speaker. The $149 asking price is at the higher end of the scale as these things go, but you're also getting a speaker that's better than just about anything else in this category.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a8b5742a-3345-4e52-8613-d21382adab4f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8SjG44BgG6qhEJfgcQdBwa.jpg' alt="Marshall Emberton III Bluetooth speaker in Black and Brass."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Marshall Emberton III</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Don't let its size fool you; the Emberton III delivers a booming sound that's full of vibrancy and character. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

It has a lovely, grippy texture on the grip, which gives you a much more ergonomic way to take pictures with your phone. The little button on top is a Bluetooth shutter button, so all you need to do is pair it with your Pixel, and it works without any configuration at all.</p><p>What's best about it is that the button doesn't take much effort to press. You click it in, for sure, but it's not enough of a depress to shake your phone. If you've ever tried to take a picture with the volume button on your phone and found the photo ended up blurry, that's because the volume button takes too much pressure to depress. Not this shutter button.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-amazon-prime-day-big-deal-days-faq-2025"><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see FAQ and deal predictions</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8dbf869f-1aa5-417d-a27d-3675a72137af" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This 3-in-1 magnetic camera grip makes your phone feel more like a professional camera with an ergonomic handle, physical shutter button, and magnetic connector.

Just like the grip I talked about above, you pair the remote to your phone, and the button takes a photo or starts/stops a video.</p><p>Now, while I <em>do</em> use this thing every day (and on every trip I've taken this summer), I wish it were a little sturdier than fully extended. I recommend using the remote shutter if you plan to have it 5ft tall, because even tapping the shutter button on your phone will make it wobbly. Not wobbly like it's going to fall over, but wobbly enough to be distracting in a recorded video.</p><p>I also wish the head would rotate like a traditional tripod. It tilts nearly a full 180 degrees back and forth, but it doesn't really rotate at all, making some uses a bit limited. If neither of those things bothers you, though, this is a phenomenal travel tripod that you're going to love.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The super-thin and lightweight design means that the Galaxy Book 5 Pro is perfect for travel (even if the 16-inch model is a bit on the larger size), while the 3K AMOLED touchscreen display is an absolute joy to behold. And again, despite the sturdy all-metal construction, the 16-inch Galaxy Book 5 Pro clocks in at just under 3.5 pounds. </p><p>The Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) processors deliver consistently powerful performance that's fast enough for both work and play (or both at the same time), plus you get a large battery that regularly lasts me over a day on a single charge. </p><p>Furthermore, the Galaxy Book 5 Pro boasts plenty of ports for all of your devices, including HDMI, two USB-Cs, and a microSD slot. There's even a USB-A port, which Apple ditched on its laptops years ago. This particular model also comes with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. </p><p>Indeed, there's not a lot of bad stuff to say about the Galaxy Book 5 Pro, and anything I write here will probably just come off as nitpicky. No, it doesn't have a convertible design; no, it doesn't have a backlit keyboard. But I don't consider those features to be must-haves anyway.</p><p>Whether it's the absolute <em>best laptop for you</em> might be another story. After all, even with a $400 discount, spending $1,249.99 on any device nowadays is a significant investment. </p><p>Depending on your needs, you could get an equally-great experience for much less cash by investing in one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> or a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet</a>. But if you've already looked around and discovered that the Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro is for you, I wouldn't wait to make your purchase. </p> ]]></dc:content>

This will enable the AI to perform "multi-step" tasks, such as ordering groceries for you.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1008px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.52%;"><img id="gRUHTnc76WkQCcB5Tedtb8" name="google-chrome-gemini-in-chrome-intro" alt="Gemini in Chrome is users new AI browsing assistant, capable of answering questions about a webpage or a video you're watching." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gRUHTnc76WkQCcB5Tedtb8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1008" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="hTGVHPDNLWaoqc6xbWdec8" name="google-chrome-ask-gemini-summarize-youtube-video-timestamps" alt="Gemini in Chrome on a computer will soon let users ask the AI questions about a video or let it summarize its contents." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTGVHPDNLWaoqc6xbWdec8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1068" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Today (Sep 18), Gemini in Chrome is rolling out for the browser on Windows and Mac in the U.S. (English) with integration with other apps like Google Docs, Calendar, YouTube, and Maps. According to Google, this app integration will let users "schedule meetings, see location details, and more without leaving the page you’re on." For YouTube, users can ask Gemini to summarize the video and receive a bulleted list of its key points, as well as timestamps so you can go and see for yourself.</p><p>Android and iOS users can expect this major update "soon." Google states users on Android can activate Gemini by holding the power button. For iOS, Gemini in Chrome will be built into the app.</p><p>Google's powerful AI Search is also headed to Chrome's address bar, also known as its omnibox.</p><h2 id="ai-mode-reaches-chrome-2">AI Mode reaches Chrome</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1075px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.81%;"><img id="ifKqgaB2x2fS2UNwGV2hhW" name="google-chrome-ai-mode-omnibox" alt="Users can find AI Mode in Chrome's omnibox (address bar), which can offer suggested questions about the page you're viewing, while also giving you the chance to ask your own." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ifKqgaB2x2fS2UNwGV2hhW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1075" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1071px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.02%;"><img id="afxVHk2gpxTpuqSr2uPnhW" name="google-chrome-ai-mode-omnibox-ai-overview" alt="After asking AI Mode a question from Chrome's address bar, users will be given an AI Overview of answers directly on the page, via a sidebar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/afxVHk2gpxTpuqSr2uPnhW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1071" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Rolling out "later this month" in the U.S., users browsing on the web will find an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">AI Mode</a> option when interacting with Chrome's address bar.

These are an upgrade over Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), as they provide an in-lens display, more advanced camera features, and an included neural band for gesture support.</p><p>Notably, the name begins with Meta instead of Ray-Ban this time around, signalling that these glasses are more focused on capability than style — although they still sport much sleeker, Ray-Ban style frames than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>.</p><p>Meta is getting a leg-up on Google and Amazon in a big way with this release, as it marks the first time Meta is shipping a pair of smart glasses with a display. That display turns this into a sort of "smartwatch for your face" since it still connects to your phone, but has plenty of capability all on its own, too.</p><p>Meta also launched a more affordable pair of AI glasses called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a>, which are more focused on style with cameras and audio-based AI at the forefront, and a sportier pair called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a>, which is geared towards athletes who want extra-long battery life, IP67 protection, and more. But Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses are the company's most advanced pair to date, which you can read more about below.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="65ffe52b-cab8-44aa-b6b8-95a21ac69f53" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="at your local Best Buy" data-dimension48="at your local Best Buy" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/meta-glasses-with-display" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="TYfB7CqSmfQbYBfu6XjXEn" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-render-02" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TYfB7CqSmfQbYBfu6XjXEn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2160" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Check out Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/meta-glasses-with-display" data-dimension112="65ffe52b-cab8-44aa-b6b8-95a21ac69f53" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="at your local Best Buy" data-dimension48="at your local Best Buy" data-dimension25=""><strong>at your local Best Buy</strong></a>!

The glasses, a charging case, and the neural band are included in the box.</p><p>You won't be able to buy them online at the usual places, though. Instead, you'll need to head into a Best Buy, LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, or Ray-Ban store to try them in person. Select Verizon stores will also carry the glasses sometime in the near future. These glasses need a bit of personalization versus the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, which is why Meta requires an in-store visit.</p><div ><table><caption>Meta Ray-Ban Display specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Styles</p></td><td  ><p>Wayfarer-inspired</p><p>Standard and large sizes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Shiny Black, Shiny Sand</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Lenses</p></td><td  ><p>Transitions, Prescription (-4.0 to +4.0) </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>20 deg FOV monocular display in the right lens</p><p>600 x 600 pixels, 42PPD, 90Hz, 5000-nit with auto brightness, one-way private viewing</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultra-Wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>1080p+ at 30FPS (1440 x 1920 resolution)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>2X open ear speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>Custom 6-mic Array</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Magnetometer for directional awareness to enable turn by turn navigation</p><p>Integrated 6-axis IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope)</p><p>4-way active touchpad </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 1000 photos, 100 30-second videos</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>69g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 6 hours per charge</p><p>5 hours continuous audio playback or voice calling</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>30 additional hours worth of charge</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging speed</p></td><td  ><p>50% in 20 minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Neural band sizes</p></td><td  ><p>1, 2, 3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Neural band colors</p></td><td  ><p>Charcoal Black</p><p>Sand</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Neural band battery life</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 18 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Neural band durability</p></td><td  ><p>IPX7</p><p>High-performance textiles</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-design-and-features"><span>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses: Design and features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kJ5kQgXutT2r9L9XHkhWD3" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-with-gesture-band-03" alt="An official lifestyle shot of someone wearing Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJ5kQgXutT2r9L9XHkhWD3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses have a similar overall design to Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses. The biggest difference between them is the thickness of the frames, as they have to fit a display in the right lenses, plus additional computing hardware and a larger battery than the Ray-Ban Meta or Oakley Meta glasses.</p><p>In his private demo, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Android Central's Michael Hicks said</a> the thicker frames don't look like some of the other smart glasses we've seen to date. "If not for the camera cutouts, people might assume it's a stylistic choice."</p><p>The glasses feature one camera on the side of one lens and an LED indicator on the other side, giving them a uniform look. At 69g, these are just 17g heavier than Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) AI glasses, a real win for Meta and something that should help everyday comfort. Hicks noted that while they are comfortable to wear, you might want to invest in one of Meta's AI glasses for workouts, instead, as these are a bit heavy for that function.</p><div

glasses by including a display in the lower half of the right lens. This display lets you interact with the glasses in a visual way and even gives you a camera viewfinder, a key upgrade from Ray-Ban Meta glasses.</p><p>Despite being transparent, this display gets brighter than you might think. Hicks said, "Meta's team had me look at content against a sunny pavement and blue sky, and it automatically adjusted the brightness and tone so that I never had trouble with readability or colors."</p><p>You can also expect full privacy with this display, as it's impossible to see it from the other side. Only the person wearing it can see the display, and that's by design. Think of it like a one-way mirror, except here the lenses are transparent and the display is fully invisible from the outside.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

message on his Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses with barely perceptible movements of his hand. This was possible thanks to the neural band that ships with the glasses, a type of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">gesture band</a> we previously got to test out with Meta Orion at Meta Connect 2024.</p><p>This sEMG band is made of comfortable textiles that are rated for long-term use, are easy to clean, and sport an 18-hour battery life. The band can understand electrical impulses in your wrist muscles, translating that to gestures that allow you to "magically" interact with the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses.</p><p>The band is hyper-sensitive and can infer even tiny movements, so you can discreetly flip through and reply to messages even in a meeting without anyone knowing. On stage at Meta Connect 2025, Zuckerberg was also seen scrolling through a user interface with swipes of his thumb, almost like flicking through pages of a book.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi" name="meta-connect-2025-show-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-app-ui" alt="A screen capture of Mark Zuckerberg showing off Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' app UI at Meta Connect 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Holding your palm up and pinching your thumb and index fingers together brings up a "home" menu with an app launcher, similar to a smartphone or smartwatch.

Meta AI works identically here as it does on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, although Meta AI's responses can be displayed instead of just listened to.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8bc3676f-06c5-41b6-bded-859042ba9ea9">            <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/meta-glasses-with-display" data-model-name="Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iHDiDozZ6tS92CLznmMiHn.jpg' alt="An official product render of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses and the neural gesture band"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses is the next generation of wearable technology, placing a screen where you can see it without having to look down or away.

With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-lossless-listening-premium-subscribers-hear-every-refined-note-launch">Spotify finally making the move</a> to provide higher quality (maybe) streaming music with its new Lossless Listening feature, it's time to figure out if you should even care.</p><p>Lossless audio is technically a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-my-phone-have-dac-explaining-dacs-and-amps-smartphones-today">digital compression</a> method that reproduces the original analog sound perfectly. With the right equipment, it can be converted back to analog (speakers need this) and be an exact reproduction of the original.</p><p>Normally, you need to compress audio files so they aren't too large to stream. An uncompressed WAV file can be huge, even bigger than a video file. Lossless formats compress audio and programmatically toss out unnecessary information while keeping everything needed to recreate the original.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-7" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the more practical side, lossless audio is a type of compression that provides enough information so that a human can't detect a difference from the original, but it's compressed and not identical. If it's compressing information, it's no longer an exact copy. But the term works and fits.</p><p>You might have been listening to the "practical" version of lossless audio all your life and never even knew it. CD quality is a type of lossless audio. The files are differentiated by their bitrate, and a CD-quality file is 16-bit/44.1kHz (a bitrate of 16 and a sample rate of 44.1kHz). Other popular lossless formats are 24-bit/48kHz or 96kHz, and even 32-bit with as high as 128kHz for a sample rate.</p><p>Confused yet? Don't be. This is cool to know if you're into this kind of thing, but <strong>in layman's terms, lossless audio is music that should sound better and more like the original recording </strong>than a lossy file like those MP3 files you downloaded from Napster back in the day. That's what you need to know if you don't care about how any of it works.</p><h2 id="do-you-need-this-in-your-life-2">Do you need this in your life?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="P8BAR62VhBhdsZFqbU8vmL" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-wired-sony-headphones" alt="Holding a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra while wearing a pair of wired Sony headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P8BAR62VhBhdsZFqbU8vmL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate to say it, but <em>maybe</em>.

It's a follow-up to the Headphone 1, and seems to take a few cues from its over-ear sibling. The Nothing Ear 3 now features longer battery life, a tweaked sound, spec bumps, and a redesigned case. Is that enough to justify the upgrade to Ear 3, which is now about $30 more expensive? Let's find out.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-pricing-and-availability"><span>Nothing Ear 3: Pricing and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Djny4rE62qPqBoSPszEk3" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-4" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Djny4rE62qPqBoSPszEk3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After social media teasers, Nothing officially announced the Ear 3 on Sept. 18, 2025, and pre-orders are available starting now. Nothing Ear 3 costs $179 in the U.S., and is also available in the U.K. and Europe for £179 and €179, respectively. This is a slight increase in cost compared to the $149 Nothing Ear 2.</p><p>You can buy the earbuds in black or white colorways, both of which feature a transparent design and an aluminum and plastic case. Nothing Ear 3 will be generally available as of Sept. 25 on Nothing’s official website and retail partners.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-what-s-good"><span>Nothing Ear 3: What's good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vzh52FZXSAYmdA2c2SkNNb" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-8" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vzh52FZXSAYmdA2c2SkNNb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Related Reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review"><strong>Nothing Ear 1 review</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review"><strong>Nothing Ear 2 review</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review"><strong>Nothing Ear review</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Nothing kept the hardware consistent between Ear 1 and Ear 2 in terms of audio delivery, but that's overhauled with Ear 3. There's a new, larger pair of 12mm drivers that upgrades the sound in Ear 3. Nothing says these dynamic drivers feature a PMI dome with a thick TPU surround to add deeper bass, and I believe it. The Ear 3 fully buy into Nothing's recent sound signature, like what we saw on Headphone 1.</p><p>Whether you love this sound or think it could be better probably depends on your taste. It's not really balanced, regardless of what Nothing claims, and instead prioritizes the bass and lower frequencies more than mids and highs. Like with Headphone 1, I found vocals and high-end sounds a bit muddied and underwhelming on the stock "Balanced" EQ preset. Also like with Headphone 1, I found that switching the Ear 3's EQ preset to "Treble" nearly fixed all my qualms with the sound.</p><p>The good news is that the Nothing X app is very good, and there's a robust EQ built-in that you can use to customize the Ear 3 to your liking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="E4iK4HUmfASs4XxAFzXQ24" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-3" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E4iK4HUmfASs4XxAFzXQ24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While prior editions of Nothing Ear products lacked wider support for high-res audio transmission, that’s finally changing on the Ear 3. There’s still no AptX support, but LDHC 5.0 is gone in favor of LDAC support. This is the right move — while LDHC 5.0 is great if your phone supports it, not every Android model does. Notably, Samsung doesn’t support LDHC but does offer LDAC, so hi-res audio will now work on way more Android phones thanks to this welcomed Ear 3 change.</p><p>That’s just one part of the Ear 3’s connectivity upgrades. Bluetooth 5.3 is swapped for 5.4, and there’s a low-latency mode that cuts the wireless audio delay down to under 120ms. This will come in handy for gaming, and matches competing features from OnePlus and Samsung. Ear 3 also supports Google Fast Pair and Microsoft Swift Pair for near-instant connection with Android and Windows devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kfQZUeYbqfbgvzzBWVQEZb" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-10" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kfQZUeYbqfbgvzzBWVQEZb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life was another drawback that came with using Nothing Ear 1 and 2, however, Ear 3 significantly improves the situation. You get up to 5.5 hours of listening time out of each earbud, and that’s with the Adaptive ANC mode turned on. The charging case, which supports wireless charging and USB-C, brings the total to 22 hours. There is one battery life “catch” that we’ll get to later.</p><p>Nothing’s big bet with Ear 3 has nothing to do with the earbuds themselves. It added a dual-microphone system to the Ear 3 charging case, and the brand calls it “Super Mic.” There’s a TALK button on the case that, when pressed, switches the audio input from the earbuds themselves to the case. It’s designed for calls and voice memos, and you can use it for longer sessions by double-pressing the TALK key.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BsoEoXVsPdpmw2tdjuyNu" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-6" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BsoEoXVsPdpmw2tdjuyNu.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Surprisingly, I think there’s a demand for this. It’s not uncommon to see people use wired earbuds or headsets because wired mic quality is just so much better than what we get from wireless earbuds. Nothing Ear 3 flips that notion on its head by adding a mic system to the case that’s better than what you’d get on wireless earbuds or your phone.</p><p>Switching between the Ear 3 mics and Super Mic on calls, people I talked to immediately noticed the difference, picking up on the extra loudness and crispness of my voice, as well as the separation between my voice and loud environments. As someone who owns the DJI Mic 3 — the pinnacle of wireless lavaliere microphones — and <em>never</em> uses it because I don’t have it with me when I need it, the Ear 3’s Super Mic is shockingly appealing to me.</p><p>Super Mic isn’t the only change to the Nothing Ear 3 case — it’s also partially made out of aluminum. That adds a premium feel to Ear products that can end up feeling cheaper with only plastic materials. The entire package is IP54-rated against dust, sweat, and water ingress, and the company says the aluminum case helps protect the Super Mic hardware inside. I personally think the silver aluminum case is stunning on the white variant.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="794ZZtV5gQeWxwwLJd4W83" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-5" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/794ZZtV5gQeWxwwLJd4W83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are some exclusives you get when pairing Ear 3 with a Nothing phone, and they’re pretty neat.

The ventilation isn’t as good as I would like, creating unwanted pressure and discomfort in some situations with ANC enabled. Nothing says its real-time adaptive ANC can cancel up to 45dB of sound, which is about the same as Ear 2.</p><p>Transparency mode was the dealbreaker for me, as I depend on this feature for two main tasks: ordering and talking on the phone. I need to be able to tell a flight attendant what I’d like to drink without taking out my earbuds, and hear my voice clearly while on the phone to keep my volume in check. The Nothing Ear 3 struggled to pass these tests, weirdly amplifying background voices while seeming to block out my own — likely because transparency mode wasn’t strong enough to overcome the passive noise canceling from the earbuds.</p><p>I still think you can justify buying Ear 3 if you don’t care about ANC features or use them often, and battery life jumps up to 10 hours in that case. But if ANC and transparency modes are must-haves, there are better options at this price point.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ntUt2f6PS92DhxMhLjcqzb" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-11" alt="Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ntUt2f6PS92DhxMhLjcqzb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I mentioned that battery life is finally improved, and it is. But if you want to use LDAC with ANC at the same time, battery life is cut to just 3.5 hours on each bud. On some devices, you’ll need to enable LDAC in the Nothing X app, restart the buds, and then also enable LDAC in your phone’s settings app — a complicated process for those who want hi-res audio.</p><p>Speaking of limitations, I wish Super Mic worked with native Android or iOS video recording. Using the default camera app, a phone will always use its own mics for videos instead. This is a bummer, though it can be rectified by using third-party video recording apps like Blackmagic.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-competition"><span>Nothing Ear 3: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hYp6w4jLG6GqS5pwMqgiX3" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-2" alt="Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hYp6w4jLG6GqS5pwMqgiX3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case for the Nothing Ear 3 starts to get dicey when you consider the competition it’ll face at the $180 price point. It’s not a major price increase compared to Ear 2, but the price hike means Ear 3 will face “Pro” earbuds. The AirPods Pro 2, Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 are all fairly easy to find under $200 if you’re patient enough, as there are near-constant deals on them. I’d take all three of those pairs over the Ear 3, simply because they each sound fuller, richer, and have better ANC.</p><p>For what it’s worth, the Ear 3 could eventually see discounts of its own to level the playing field. For now, Nothing’s decision to shift the price from $150 to $180 ends up putting the Ear 3 in the same realm as the upper echelon of truly-wireless earbuds.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-should-you-buy-them"><span>Nothing Ear 3: Should you buy them?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jYphpVXK5CNDW8uCXuL2pa" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-9" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYphpVXK5CNDW8uCXuL2pa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You have a Nothing phone or love the brand's design ethos</li><li>You like Nothing's signature, bass-heavy sound</li><li>You don't depend on strong ANC or transparency mode</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You have Ear 1 or Ear 2 and aren't compelled by the upgrades</li><li>Outstanding ANC and transparency modes are must-have features</li><li>You don't want to spent time tuning the Ear 3 via the app's EQ</li></ul><p>Nothing overhauled the Ear 3, bringing new solutions to old problems — and creating some new ones.

This seems to be shaping up as an important update showing beta users more than just a gist of what they can expect in December's Pixel feature drop.</p><p>This beta Google says, brings the Android 16 QPR2 to what's called "Platform stability," an important milestone in the development cycle, and the software has been refined and tweaked for general use.</p><p>Considering the software is in the "later-stage" beta, it brings with it new features as well as security updates. The one feature that really stands out is the ability to customize icon shapes— neat right? It gives users more control over how they'd like to customize their home screen and you can select from a variety of different icon styles that match you preference,  you can even turn your apps into tiny flower blobs or cookies.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.14%;"><img id="seEQHbRTSS2JgoXuuykuD8" name="Android-16-QPR2-Beta-2" alt="Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2 is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/seEQHbRTSS2JgoXuuykuD8.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="694" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another feature that's customer facing is for the fitness enthusiasts, this beta introduces upgrades to Health Connect on the device. It gives used the ability to seamlessly track their steps using the device's sensors and Google notes that this feature won't cause your battery to drain as much.  Furthermore, the data types for exercises have also been expanded to include information metrics such as weight, set index, and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE), which allows users to effectively track their workout progression.</p><p>On the developer's side of thing, Google is tightening up security, by introducing developer verification, which will become a requirement for app installation in certain regions starting in September 2026. This makes app installation on Android much more safer by preventing the spread of malware and scams, considering the tech giant had to delete several apps earlier this year as they were impacted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mass-app-deletion-underway-confirmed">widespread Ad scam</a>.

This means that if a malicious app is waiting to "catch" the OTP, it won't receive it immediately.</p><p>The beta is available for devices from Pixel 6 to the latest Pixel 10 series, and also includes the Pixel Tablet and Pixel Fold.

The company's on-device description of the feature states this AI will answer questions "about your activity, sleep, nutrition, stress, or energy score." This AI assistant, which is reportedly running off Samsung's Galaxy AI software, will let users chat with it. The company's early test states its Health Assistant will leverage your "chat history" and "health trends" to answer your questions.</p><p>As the publication notes, Samsung's Health Assistant lends itself toward personalization, using your specific statistics and data to answer questions that fit your recent sleep and wellness trends.</p><p>The Health Assistant is also reportedly positioned as more of a "guide" rather than a tool to provide a diagnosis for a person's health. In a test chat, the AI responded to the publication's questions about ways to improve their sleep, which it responded with ways to calm their "sleep environment" every night. Additionally, the AI even offered upper-body workout ideas for building more muscle.</p><p>For now, there's no telling when Samsung could roll this out in its Galaxy AI chats.</p><h2 id="using-ai-virtual-assistance-2">Using AI & Virtual Assistance</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="i7mPpv7BK49r6k4ruzd2KD" name="samsung-health-assistant-splash-screen-test" alt="A screenshot of Samsung's Health Assistant test, informing users that they can ask the AI about their "activity, sleep, nutrition" and more for personalized answers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i7mPpv7BK49r6k4ruzd2KD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:218.18%;"><img id="cUJ7JVynSa8RRP8GPajQJD" name="samsung-health-assistant-chat-intro-test" alt="A screenshot of the Samsung Health Assistant chat test, which lets users ask the AI about ways to improve their health using their specific data and trends." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUJ7JVynSa8RRP8GPajQJD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="275" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Samsung's placing its health assistance at the forefront of its devices, as a recent update for the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-health-enhances-care">brought virtual doctor visits</a>.

The setting, captured on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>, shows a toggleable option for Call Recording, Manage Recordings, and Automatic Call Recording options. For the latter, the user notes the ability to have their Pixel automatically "record calls with non-contacts," or they can write in which numbers they'd like their device to record.</p><p>The "manage" side is simply a way for users to delete stored recordings or have their Pixel do it for them.</p><p>Google provides a little explainer about Call Recording, which states the feature will activate when on a call (if it's enabled). The company states your recorded calls will remain on your device, and it reiterates the user's ability to enable or disable the feature at any time. The interesting thing about this is that Google Pixel phones have previously lacked a Call Recording feature, which the publication points out.</p><p>However, it also picked up on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9803950?hl=en">updated Google support page</a> about Call Recording, which now fully details steps for "Always Record," "start a recording," and more. It looks like Google is truly starting to move toward a Call Recording future for its Pixel phones, but only for Pixel 6 and newer phones running Android 9 or higher.</p><h2 id="is-it-truly-on-the-way-2">Is it truly on the way?</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelUsersIndia/comments/1ni9gt5/finally_call_recording">Finally call recording</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelUsersIndia">r/PixelUsersIndia</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Unfortunately, the user on Reddit seems to be the only one who's received this Call Recording feature on their Pixel. It is strangely appearing on the Pixel 9a first, which one would think Google would drop this on their Pixel 10 series first. Regardless, if Google is actually bringing this to users more consistently, maybe we'll have a more concrete announcement for it. Right now, Pixel 8a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> users on Reddit running Phone app v191.0.805002009 (public beta) don't see it.</p><p>It's been a while, but we were talking about Call Recording on Pixel devices five years ago, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/here-what-law-says-about-recording-phone-calls">there were some serious issues</a> Google ran into. The legality is the feature was called into question, as government and State laws were brought forward. These State laws, such as "All Party" and "One Party" States, require citizens to abide by a different set of rules. For the former, both parties on the call must recognize and be okay with the call being recorded. However, a one-party state only requires one person to know the call's going on record.</p><p>Of course, one of the ways users could keep tabs on a call and its contents <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-call-notes-recording-disclaimer-could-be-going-away-soon">is with Call Notes</a>. A recent APK teardown reports that Google could remove its audio disclaimer that the call is being recorded to help users remain a little stealthy. It seems that, instead of a vocal disclaimer, Call Notes could play a soft chime to let users know the call's being recorded.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Almost as exciting is the barrage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> that have been announced over the past month, all slated to arrive starting next month. Not to be left out in the cold, we've been learning more about the Anbernic RG476H over the past few weeks, and now, we know the final details.</p><p>When the RG Slide was introduced, Anbernic also introduced a custom 4.7-inch LTPS display sporting a 1280x960 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Since then, the same screen has appeared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/anbernic-rg477m-takes-a-metal-approach-to-gaming-handhelds">RG477M</a> and is also being used in the RG476H.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:768px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="w8pkTft6RoBAb8KSiTza5J" name="anbernic-rg476h-pricing-reveal" alt="Anbernic RG476H Pre-order discount details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w8pkTft6RoBAb8KSiTza5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="768" height="1024" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While AYANEO and AYN are battling it out with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ds-is-the-worlds-first-dual-screen-android-handheld">clamshell designs</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-announces-dual-screen-thor-and-next-gen-odin-3-handhelds">Snapdragon 8 Elite chips</a>, Anbernic took a different route, opting to go with the Unisoc T820 for the RG476H. That's a step below the RG477M, which is powered by the Dimensity 8300, but for good reason. Whereas the RG477M retails for around $280, the RG476H comes in at $165, with pre-orders <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg476h">dropping that down to $150</a> for the first three days.</p><p>No, the RG476H won't win you any performance awards, but it still offers a great gaming experience, provided that you understand the limitations. This isn't Anbernic's first rodeo with the T820, as it also powered the RG556, RG406V, and RG406H from last year, and is also found in the RG Slide from earlier this year.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/87sLIS5vvTs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>What that means in terms of emulation is that you'll be able to play a lot of the respective PS2 and GameCube libraries. However, you might run into issues playing some games that either require a bit of tinkering around, or just won't work at all. You can even squeeze a bit of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-cant-believe-it-theres-actually-a-switch-emulator-on-the-play-store">Switch emulation</a> out the T820, provided that you're playing games that aren't very graphics intensive.</p><p>In addition to the 4.7-inch, 120Hz display and the Unisoc T820, the rest of the Anbernic RG476H specs can be found below:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1504px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RsfRwrAnes8Ztqn49vpS5J" name="anbernic-rg476h-features-bento-render" alt="Some features of the Anbernic RG476H" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsfRwrAnes8Ztqn49vpS5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1504" height="846" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>Anbernic RG476H</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>4.7-inch LTPS, 1280 x 960, 120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Unisoc T820</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB LPDDR4X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB UFS 2.2 + microSD (up to 2TB)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh (~6 hours)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Extras</p></td><td  ><p>Anbernic AI, Hall Effect Joysticks w/ RGB, USB-C DisplayPort Out, Active Cooling</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Considering that pre-orders for the KONKR Pocket FIT and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-3-is-the-first-snapdragon-8-elite-handheld-starting-at-just-usd299">AYN Odin 3</a> are still available, giving you a Snapdragon 8 Elite for under $300, Anbernic had to tread carefully.

That brings me to the point of this post; Indian accessory brand UltraProlink just rolled out a new cable that has USB-C, Lightning, and Apple Watch puck baked in. The cable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/ULTRAPROLINK-charging-Connector-Wireless-Macbooks/dp/B0F88F1VHR">costs ₹1,699 in India</a>, which is decent enough when you consider the trio of connectors available.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="JGfFRhVQQvd5hSQhGaMiaR" name="UltraProlink iLink Trio" alt="UltraProlink iLink Trio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JGfFRhVQQvd5hSQhGaMiaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cable is called iLink Trio, and it has a standard USB-C connector at one end.

In the example above, someone asked Meta AI to "make a stylized desert terrain," then followed by adding mountains with rocks, surrounding foliage, and, finally, a "desert city" that ties everything together.</p><p>While you'll still need to do things in steps like this to create a world, Meta says, "we’re not far off from being able to create compelling 3D  content as easily as you can ask Meta AI a question today." In other words, Meta hopes to make AI an integral part of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/virtual-reality-a-complete-guide-to-vr-headsets-vr-glasses-and-more">virtual reality</a> experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="czi7pJmmEhNZiZ8nubLUqZ" name="gordon-ramsay-home-meta-hyperscape" alt="An animation showing Meta's Hyperscape tech mapping Gordon Ramsay's home into a photorealistic virtual environment" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/czi7pJmmEhNZiZ8nubLUqZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="640" height="360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're also seeing major changes and upgrades to the Horizon Worlds ecosystem on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/meta-quest">Meta Quest</a> headsets. The "immersive home" environment that appears when you power on your Meta Quest headset is now linked directly to Horizon Worlds via the Horizon Central environment. You can immediately jump into popular worlds and easily converse with other users, plus pin apps and other windows to the walls in the environment, and even watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-beats-android-xr-makes-instagram-scrolling-spatial">3D content on Instagram</a>.</p><p>All of this is powered by the new Meta Horizon Engine, which Meta says has been "built from scratch and optimized to help bring the  metaverse to life." Meta says that graphics are not only better than ever, but things load 4x faster, and 5x as many people can be in one world at a time. That'll make social environments feel a lot more <em>social</em> and less like being in a limited game environment.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bzMTejqie5gYUDVrBz9FMe" name="meta-horizon-tv-app-home-official-screenshot" alt="An official screenshot of the 2025 Meta Horizon TV App update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bzMTejqie5gYUDVrBz9FMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Horizon Central allowed users wearing Quest headsets to watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect 2025</a> live alongside other players, and it's clear this vision of live events and interconnection is what Meta is pushing as the future of VR social spaces. Meta maintains <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest-2/2532035600194083/events/">a list of Horizon Worlds events</a> that includes concerts at Red Rocks, big names like Sabrina Carpenter, late-night comedy shows, and much more.</p><p>Meta also notes that photorealistic worlds are launching soon, powered by the company's Hyperscape engine, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/meta-horizon-hyperscape-demo/7972066712871980/">you can try on Meta Quest headsets for free right now</a>. Hyperscape Capture also launches in early access today, letting you use your Meta Quest headset to scan your room and turn it into a photorealistic world your friends can visit.</p><p>Lastly, Meta is launching Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN on the Horizon TV app, which is already preinstalled on your Meta Quest headset. It's becoming the new center for streaming media, simplifying things by removing the need to install additional apps. It's a bit like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> interface, so it feels immediately familiar and easy to use. Plus, Meta just launched an exclusive 3D clip of Avatar: Fire and Ash on the Horizon TV app, which you should definitely check out if you've got a Quest headset.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As for the over-extension hinges, they are made using titanium, ensuring both durability against wear and tear and a lightweight design.</p><p>The smartglasses are powered by a first-of-their-kind ultra-narrow steelcan batteries that are smoothly embedded in the glasses' thin temple arms, giving them extended battery life.</p><h2 id="the-magic-of-display-2">The magic of 'Display'</h2><div><blockquote><p>This isn't about strapping a phone to your face.

The display's custom-built light engine provides sharp, bright visuals with 42 pixels per degree of view—a density not found in any other smartglasses to date.</p><p>According to Meta, these lenses are photochromatic, meaning they adjust automatically based on the light you're in. For privacy, the in-lens display has minimal light leakage (just 2%), and a capture LED that lets people know when the camera is recording, so that they aren't caught off guard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GdRiG33v2ANhCApnn9TGKk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-messaging" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing text messaging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GdRiG33v2ANhCApnn9TGKk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, you wouldn't want to be bumping into things or people while looking at texts or the map, so Meta has placed the display off to the side so it won't block your view. "This isn't about strapping a phone to your face. It's about helping you quickly accomplish some of your everyday tasks without breaking your flow," the press release added.</p><p>What's exciting is that these glasses come with an EMG Meta Neural Band, with an 18-hour battery life and an IPX7 water rating. It is made to detect muscle movements and hand gestures made by the user. This basically replaces the need for you to reach for your glasses, and lets you control it with a sensor on your wrist, so users can "scroll, click, and, in the near future, even write out messages using subtle finger movements," the blog adds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DhhjPYtpeL9Ew65UivowJn" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-render-neural-band" alt="An official product render of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' neural gesture band fabric texture" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DhhjPYtpeL9Ew65UivowJn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="here-s-comes-meta-ai-2">Here's comes Meta AI </h2><p>Meta's AI is basically what makes these glasses so unique. According to the company, users will be leveraging its multimodality, meaning it can show you answers and step-by-step how-tos, like having a conversation with someone. Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses can help with messages and video calling, from WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It lets you control your camera shots better with the ability to zoom and preview them before you click.</p><p>These smartglasses are said to provide "phone-free" turn-by-turn navigation with walking directions, along with Live translation and captions during conversations. According to AC's Senior Editor Michael Hicks, it cuts out the noise of other people's conversations, so you only get captions for the folks you're actually looking at.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4NSfiFEdgymW9EkVKzMkSk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-recipe-tomato" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing a Meta AI prompt about a tomato recipe" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4NSfiFEdgymW9EkVKzMkSk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-navigation" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing turn-by-turn navigation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-live-captions" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing live captions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Starting at $799, the Meta Ray-Ban Display (glasses and Meta Neural Band included) launches on September 30 at select US retailers (Best Buy, LensCrafters, Ray-Ban Stores, Verizon), with expansion to Canada, France, Italy, and the UK in early 2026.

I had the chance to wear them while running on the treadmill on Meta's campus before Connect, and I could instantly tell they were exactly what I'd been looking for.</p><p>I've been trying to make the old Ray-Ban Metas work as a running companion for years; I even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">wore Ray-Bans during a half-marathon</a> this year. But battery and hardware issues made them an imperfect companion — issues that the new Vanguard design seems to have resolved.</p><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard's redesigned fit and nine hours of battery life are vital upgrades for athletes. My last-gen Ray-Bans slide constantly down my face or bounce on my nose while running, while the Vanguards stayed secure during a treadmill sprint.</p><p>And where the last models can't be trusted to survive a long workout, this model gives you enough buffer room to survive a marathon with full streaming and occasional photos.</p><h2 id="fitness-ready-hardware-and-software-coming-together-2">Fitness-ready hardware and software coming together</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="J5XMQSo5SwxwUehZqHqiKE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-selfie" alt="A selfie of the author wearing the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses at Meta Connect 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J5XMQSo5SwxwUehZqHqiKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Oakley Meta Vanguards are six decibels louder than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley HSTNs</a>. In my demo, I appreciated the rich audio above the loud whirring of a treadmill and the chatter of demos around me, keeping the Meta AI responses audible.</p><p>But beyond the hardware, what most excited me was how Meta focused the software and intangibles to make Vanguard work well during runs (or any other sports).</p><p>Exhibit A: You can sync a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> to your Vanguard glasses and hear your workout stats at any time, without having to look down at your watch and swipe through widgets.</p><p>Meta had me strap on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Garmin Forerunner 570</a> running watch and start walking on a treadmill. I asked, "Hey Meta, what's my current pace?" and "What's my heart rate?" and received prompt and timely answers, because of the Meta AI-Garmin Connect integration.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JNzPdRyHKoSGPTgzcbKFeD" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-with-Meta-AI-workout-summary" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses sitting on a treadmill next to a phone showing a Meta AI workout summary." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNzPdRyHKoSGPTgzcbKFeD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I switched to a hard run and was able to keep asking Meta AI questions about my form and speed while keeping my eyes facing forward. I appreciated that I could ask about any stat Garmin tracks, without worrying about swiping through watch menus to find it.</p><p>Meta's rep told me this feature only works with a few Garmin workout types, like Running and Walking, for now, but that they plan to expand it. He then explained that if you're following a Garmin course, you can program your glasses to auto-capture photos at mile markers or landmarks, which is a fascinating idea.</p><p>I'd love to see Meta expand its live workouts to more fitness brands in the future. For now, you can sync Meta AI with an Apple Watch or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> with Health Connect, and see a personalized summary of how this activity compares to past efforts.</p><p>This isn't quite as exciting as hearing your stats mid-workout, but at least it's a free alternative to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/strava-interview-athlete-intelligence-inaccurate-gps-race-leaderboards-and-more">Strava AI</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect+</a> summaries.</p><h2 id="action-photos-just-got-even-easier-2">Action photos just got even easier</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="c35922bo7jz8iM5sZXpMED" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-held-in-hand" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses held in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c35922bo7jz8iM5sZXpMED.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="og6jAjbGG9npMjRpu3oteB" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-side-view-logo" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses from a side view showing the design and Oakley logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/og6jAjbGG9npMjRpu3oteB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="P5jsrQT8PkTvEic94joEEE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-back-view" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses from the back, showing the displays, nose guards, and Oakley Meta logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P5jsrQT8PkTvEic94joEEE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Capturing candid, stabilized shots mid-workout is a specialty of Meta AI glasses, and I took a few 3K photos with Vanguard that came out clearly. They're the same quality as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review">current Oakley HSTN photos</a>, but I appreciate that the 122º wide-angle lens is centered now, so it's a little easier to judge what you're capturing.</p><p>What I'm even more excited about, though, is that Meta is introducing new shortcut commands you can say without the Meta AI preamble. Most notably, you can simply say "Photo" to trigger a capture, saving you time and making it more likely you'll capture a cool moment.</p><p>You still have the photo/video button, but Meta added a second configurable Action button next to it that you can use to trigger specific shortcuts, such as slow motion/ hyperlapse videos for capturing an epic extreme-sports moment, or controlling your music.</p><p>Best of all, the Vanguards have an IP67 rating — compared to IPX4 on the current models — that makes them much better suited to both extreme sports and everyday workouts, with no fear that rain or sweat will break something.</p><h2 id="who-are-they-for-besides-me-2">Who are they for?

But in that specific use case, they're truly exciting.</p><p>Wearing them at Meta Connect, I found them comfortable and securely fitted enough that I could see myself taking them out on every run, protecting my eyes and giving me the music and photos I need to stay in the zone.</p><p>They're certainly suited for extreme athletes, as the Red Bull sports demo on stage at Connect proved. But I think anyone who works out regularly will benefit, especially if they like to share their progress on social media or save memories from races.</p><p>Meta is launching the Oakley Meta Vanguard in Black with Prizm 24K and Road lenses, or in White with Black or Sapphire lenses. It will cost $499/ €549/ £499 in 17 countries in North America and Europe, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-vanguard-glasses/">preorder it now</a> before the October 21 launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Keeping that in mind, today (Sep 17), the Meta Connect 2025 event announced the return of its most popular lenses, the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)—better and stronger than before. Meta states that it hasn't changed much from what you remember about the Gen 2 lenses; however, it has shifted to make noteworthy improvements that you'll surely notice.</p><p>Under that modern exterior, the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) boasts a huge upgrade to its cameras. The ultrawide 12MP camera consumers are familiar with can now record videos at 3K Ultra HD. Meta states its AI glasses can reach heights of 60fps with this recording quality/resolution.</p><p>Regarding its video capabilities, the press release states the enhanced Gen 2 glases can record 3K video at 30fps for up to three minutes. Specifications also mention 1440p at 30fps recording for up to three minutes, and 1200p recording at 60fps for up to three minutes, as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AeXD3FyAYYdRDcM76tKXyX" name="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-official-lifestyle-01" alt="An official lifestyle photo of a person wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AeXD3FyAYYdRDcM76tKXyX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The upgrades continue for the second-generation lenses, as Meta also details an enhanced battery life. These Gen 2 glasses can last up to eight hours with "typical use" and, when you need to charge, they can reach 50% in roughly 20 minutes. The on-the-go charging case gives consumers up to 48 hours of additional battery time for whenever you're running low.</p><p>While these features are what will pique interest in Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 consumers, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect 2025</a> announcements didn't stop there. "Later this fall," Meta says it plans to update its hands-free filming capabilities, bringing hyperlapse and slow motion options to users. These two filming options are headed for "all of our AI glasses." So, expect these on lenses beyond just the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2.</p><p>More than that, Meta's AI glasses are also looking at a new conversational update called "Conversation Focus." The brand's AI glasses will attempt to "amplify" the person's voice that you're speaking with to give it some separation from all the background noise. This will arrive as a software update for Ray-Ban Meta and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> glasses.</p><p>Live translation capabilities on its AI glasses support German and Portuguese as of today (Sep 17).</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-enhance-2">Ray-Ban Meta, Enhance!</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nt9kVcVSbQEg3skttFXABY" name="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-official-lifestyle-05" alt="An official lifestyle photo of 2 people wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nt9kVcVSbQEg3skttFXABY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's a Ray-Ban Meta glasses announcement without styles?

Everything happens on your glasses!</p><p>Meta is launching Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) with enhanced live translation support, including German and Portuguese languages. In a later update, Meta will upgrade the glasses with the ability to live translate even when your phone is in airplane mode (or otherwise offline) by downloading language packs.</p><p>Meta also announced a new Conversation Mode coming in a future update, which uses the AI glasses' open-ear speakers to amplify the voice of the person you're talking to.

Just like most of Amazon's other devices in the lineup, you can just plug it straight into your TV and start watching through your favorite streaming services. The remote offers hands-free voice commands with Alexa, making it easy to control playback, volume, and even smart home devices through the unit.</p><p>The Fire TV Stick 4K comes with 8GB of onboard storage for apps and 2GB of RAM, which is just as much as the other premium options, but more than Amazon's HD model.</p><p>It utilizes Wi-Fi 6, and it offers cloud gaming via Amazon Luna and Xbox Game Pass. It's also compatible with Dolby Atmos audio, and includes video features such as Dolby Vision and the latest versions of HDR.</p><p>Overall, it's definitely best saved for those who actually have a 4K TV, but if you do fall into that category, $30 should come as a tempting offer at which to access that level of high-res streaming.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I can't blame anyone, while not much was really said, a lot was implied in an attempt to build hype from a master of building hype. The plan worked exactly as intended.</p><p>There are a few "real" hints at Nothing's future in Pei's forum post. Nothing will have a new product this fall. Nothing was able to get a handful of companies that often make investments they know won't pan out to give him some money. Nothing has shipped "millions" of devices in four years. And Nothing knows it has to get on the AI train while it's the current trend. Pei hints that the company wants to do it a bit differently.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nothing OS 4.0 Refined.

He said, "<em>The next chapter for Nothing, integrating an AI experience into our hardware devices to reinvent how technology amplifies us,</em>" and to me, that can only mean one thing: Nothing is going to try its hand at building its own AI suite rather than partnering with another company. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Think Samsung</a>, not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">Motorola</a>.</p><p>Regardless, Android Central has reached out to Nothing for clarification on its plans and what its "AI OS" is, and will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="the-hard-truth-2">The hard truth</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP" name="rabbit-r1-vision.jpg" alt="Vision mode on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But the truth is, and I'll be blunt, if devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-bought-into-the-ai-hype-and-all-i-got-was-an-orange-square">Rabbit R1</a> were what consumers wanted to buy, Apple and Samsung/Google would be making them. Even then, the Rabbit was just another Android presented in a way that didn't seem like an Android. Instead, Apple and Samsung are building AI into the OS one chunk at a time at a pace they can manage without breaking everything.</p><p>There's another truth to think about, especially when it comes to smartphones. You have two options <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huaweis-android-replacement-os-will-start-rolling-out-june">outside of China</a>: Android or the graveyard where good things go once they have died. Look for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facepalm">webOS</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-you-wish-windows-phone-still-existed">Windows Phone</a> logos on the tombstones to know you've found it. People do not want something that doesn't offer at least as much as what they are used to having. When it comes to a phone, that means a million apps and the infrastructure to keep adding more features.</p><p>Pei and every other CEO in the mobile business know this. I don't know what Nothing's AI OS will be like, but I know it will likely be based on Android, with access to the Google suite of mobile services and the Play Store. What I'm hoping to see are products that "talk" and "learn" from each other.</p><h2 id="the-vision-2">The vision</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Imagine having a Nothing AI OS account and using it for several devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">your phone</a>, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">headphones</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablet</a>, or anything "smart." What you do on one device can affect what happens on the others without you making any decisions if they are tied together well. It could need to be incredibly intrusive when it comes to your privacy, but whoever does it the right way first will be ahead of the game once everyone else figures it out.</p><p>I think this is what Nothing is shooting for: an Android-powered OS on every device it sells, from smartphones to smart glasses, with AI and smarts baked in so that it all works together. It's the same thing Samsung, Google, Apple, Xiaomi, and everyone else are working towards. Nothing is small enough, maneuverable enough, and bold enough to go for it where other companies must be more cautious.</p><p>Nothing isn't likely to make the next Rabbit R1 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humane-announces-its-departure-from-the-ai-scene-hp-acquires-it-for-usd116-million">Humane AI Pin</a>, and probably has no plans to try it. Nothing wants to make the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> in a way that works better with the Pixel 10 version of a watch or earbuds. Smart devices being smarter together would be the next breakthrough we keep hearing about.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While most user-facing changes shipped earlier with Android 16 QPR1, including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a>, Android 16 QPR2 is set to bring two major UI changes: forced dark mode and auto-themed app icons.</p><p>Forced dark mode, as the name suggests, will implement dark mode in apps that don't support it natively. On the other hand, auto-themed app icons have existed in Android for some time, but Google hasn't forced developers to make their icons compatible. This has resulted in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-make-material-you-adaptive-icon-pack-icon-pack-studio">poor user experience</a>, with some icons supporting Material You theming while others look out of place.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-qpr2-beta-1-is-here">Android 16 QPR2</a> will aim to fix this by forcing all app icons to adopt the system's theme. Google says the new icon theming engine applies a color-filtering algorithm that renders app icons in a monochrome style, making them consistent with the chosen theme.</p><p>Google is now formally notifying developers as well. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-icon-theming-agreement-3597899/">Android Authority</a>, starting October 15 for existing developers, revisions to Google Play's Developer Distribution Agreement (DDA) section 5.3 will take effect, stating that users will be allowed "permission to modify colors or adjust themes of apps.".</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.34%;"><img id="ohUceg9WKbmmSAvU7SUE8D" name="google-play-rule-change" alt="Google Play rule changes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohUceg9WKbmmSAvU7SUE8D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2650" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With this change, Google aims to help both users and developers avoid potential conflicts, such as issues with modifying a brand's icon. For new developers, the rules already went into effect on September 15, 2025.</p><p>This change also seems necessary for Google to protect itself from takedown notices from brands and developers. Still, it's great to see Google finally taking steps to improve icon theming on Android.</p><p>Apple did something similar with iOS 18, but even though Google implemented universal icon theming earlier, it's only now being properly and fully enforced.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It shows us Garmin's template for how it's going to compete with brands like Apple and Samsung, which are pivoting to more personalized health data and coaching.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1613801/pn/010-03013-02">Venu 4</a> itself is similar in style to its predecessor, fairly skinny and light with limited buttons and an AMOLED display surrounded by a metal bezel.

It makes the Venu 4 much better as a training guide than the Venu 3 was.</p><p>As for what's new, the Venu 4 is introducing a Garmin Fitness Coach that creates a workout plan that includes 25 different types of workouts, designed for athletes who do a variety of indoor and gym workouts in addition to outdoor training. It's perfect for well-rounded athletes.</p><p>On a similar note, you can now log several activity types in one with the "mixed session activity profile."

You'll still need the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a> to get maps and other premium features, however.</p><p>Available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1613801/pn/010-03013-02">starting September 22</a>, the Garmin Venu 4 41mm and 45mm both start at $549, or $599 with a premium leather band.

Pair that with a luxurious, eye-catching design and you're looking at an all-around fabulous Android experience.</p><p>Needless to say, this year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is a better phone in just about every way, but perfection comes at a price.

Just be aware that the OnePlus 12 doesn't have IP68 ingress protection, and you'll only get four more years of OS upgrades.</p><p>OnePlus phones can also have some issues with US carriers, so be sure to check with your phone company before you commit.

In a community post, CEO Carl Pei laid out plans to make its AI-native devices, along with the company's own operating system that would run on its smartphones in the future.</p><p>Pei stated that the company's own OS will be "significantly different" from what is currently available.

Essentially, it is designed to automate tedious tasks on the phone, allowing the user sufficient time to focus on what matters to them on the device.</p><p>He also goes on to say that, unlike most OS available today, Nothing's new OS will be unique to the user, meaning that "a billion different operating systems will be rendered for a billion different people," Pei added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LmLKWkoSF7M3Wjt6Rp3iMR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmLKWkoSF7M3Wjt6Rp3iMR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In his "vision" for the company, Pei believes that new hardware is crucial for really unlocking AI's full potential, especially since smartphones haven't kept pace with AI's quick progress.

While totally respectable for a normal fitness watch, it's on the low end for the Instinct series.</p><p>That said, its 29 GPS hours of tracking actually beats the original Crossover (25 hours), though its 15 hours of multi-band tracking loses to the 50mm Instinct 3 (30 hours).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Xr2LdTbLpwmP8To4e3J3f9" name="Garmin-Instinct-Crossover-AMOLED-hiking-photo" alt="A photo of a person hiking with a heavy pack while wearing the Garmin Instinct Crossover AMOLED watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xr2LdTbLpwmP8To4e3J3f9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The original Crossover's 0.9-inch monocolor display was nothing to write home about, automatically truncating notifications and widgets to accommodate the lower resolution.</p><p>This AMOLED hybrid still relies on button controls instead of touch, but gives you the space to make things readable, even with the watch hands taking up space. And you get sapphire glass instead of basic "chemically strengthened" protection, along with the new flashlight and upgraded GPS accuracy.</p><p>“From a day on the hiking trail to a night on the town, Instinct Crossover AMOLED offers the best of both worlds," says Garmin VP Susan Lyman.</p><p>The Instinct Crossover AMOLED offers a more classic style than the Instinct 3, with a steel bezel instead of aluminum and vibrant hands that are easy to see in any environment. Garmin promises that its RevoDrive tech will "detect and recalibrate misaligned hands" so you always know the correct time; it's something they offered in the original Crossover.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="sDnabtyTWtk38E8g7XqAs9" name="Garmin-Instinct-Crossover-AMOLED-night-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Instinct Crossover AMOLED watch on a person's arm at night." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sDnabtyTWtk38E8g7XqAs9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the specs sheet, the Instinct Crossover AMOLED weighs 67g with 15mm thickness, slightly heavier than the Instinct 3 but with a similar bulky design.</p><p>Garmin is launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1800201/">Instinct Crossover AMOLED at $649</a> in two colorways: charcoal and bronze/ sunburst.

This new feature is all about making it easier and more affordable for women to really understand how their lifestyle choices impact their cycle.</p><p>This partnership aims at syncing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring AIR </a>with Clue, which allows users to automatically import up to six months of their cycle history from Clue directly into the Ultrahuman app, instead of switching between two apps to look for their health data.</p><p>The company says that the combined real-time data from Ultrahuman such as skin temperature, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability, along with cycle tracking information from Clue will allow users to see how their menstrual cycle phases correlate with their activity levels, sleep patterns, giving them a clear picture as to how different factors impact their cycle and if they need to take action to improve health.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RGwc3XauVdb6Te4yVztBU7" name="Ultrahuman-air-clue-collab" alt="Ultrahuman partners with Clue to give woman better cycle tracking insights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGwc3XauVdb6Te4yVztBU7.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"This combined view provides women with a broader picture of their health, bringing together cycle patterns and daily biomarkers in one place," Ultrahuman stated in its press release. This only makes it easier for women to notice connections between, let's say, sleep patterns and how their period is either on time or delayed, reflect on health goals, and adapt routines in ways that feel aligned with their bodies.</p><p>As for how this works, the ring tracks the body's biomarkers and tracks how the body also reacts differently during various cycle phases—such as the follicular and luteal phases—which can affect energy levels, mood, and resilience. For example, a user might see how their skin temperature and resting heart rate increase during the luteal phase, which can help them correlate these and make changes to their routines if needed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oMbFcnXZmgNNjUqpxompe6" name="Ultrahuman-air-clue-collab" alt="Ultrahuman partners with Clue to give woman better cycle tracking insights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oMbFcnXZmgNNjUqpxompe6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, users will also be able to record the intensity of cramps and mood swings with the Clue Plus subscription, and see how they connect with Ultrahuman Ring's recovery and temperature insights. This kind of tracking is helpful for women of all ages, whether they're trying to track their period, fertility, get pregnancy insights, or perimenopause guidance.</p><p>Lastly, every purchase of the Ultrahuman Ring AIR now includes a full year of Clue Plus for $9.99 – reduced from $39.99. This subscription also provides extended 12-month forecasting and expert-backed guidance from clinicians to help users better understand their bodies. And for those who already own an Ultrahuman Ring Air, the company says it is working to get you access to Clue Plus at a special price in the near future.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3311906c-1cb2-4380-8f0e-f5e825a485bd">            <a href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/buy/us/" data-model-name="Ultrahuman Ring Air" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jWmpt8LYymbGiqxuSRfTcZ.jpg' alt="Close-up render of the Aster Black Ultrahuman Ring Air"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ultrahuman Ring Air</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star half"></span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="70" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Blending in</strong></em></p><p>Do you dislike the feeling of something on your wrist while sleeping?

I had UniFi cameras previously, and while I like what Ubiquiti does with its products, lack of integration with Google Home and Home Assistant was a deal-breaker. That's why I went with Nest; I wanted cameras that would be easy-to-use and tied in with Google Home.</p><p>While it was annoying to buy Nest Aware just to be able to access footage from my cameras, I did so because of the convenience, even when Google hiked the price to $80 a year in 2023. But with another round of hikes — with the plan now going up to $100 — I decided to move to another platform.</p><p>I needed three things: strong focus on privacy, local access, and an easy way to power the devices. I had to rule out Eufy and most other Chinese brands because of previous vulnerabilities or lack of transparency, and finally landed on Reolink. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-is-the-only-local-storage-security-camera-i-trust-and-its-at-an-all-time-low-right-now">tested the Argus 4</a> in the past, but my unit had issues with battery life — more so than the Nest Cam Outdoor — so I wasn't able to use it outdoors.</p><p>Given that I didn't want to deal with the hassle of charging the security cameras, I wanted a model that was powered by PoE or wall outlet. Thankfully, Reolink's Elite Floodlight fit my needs ideally; the camera has 180-degree coverage thanks to two lenses, and as the name suggests, it has built-in lighting to illuminate its surroundings at night.</p><p>It comes with local storage via a MicroSD slot, and there's no monthly or annual fee. Best of all, I was able to integrate it easily into my network video recorder, giving me the ability to view the camera feed from anywhere. I used the Elite Floodlight for just over three months now, and it has been nothing short of excellent.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YoKbLqw6suGEtPCQXFKX7a" name="Reolink Argus" alt="Reolink Argus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YoKbLqw6suGEtPCQXFKX7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Image quality is clean and detailed, and the camera does a great job stitching footage from the dual lenses. I didn't see any issues with low-light footage either, and the built-in floodlight gets incredibly bright (going up to 3000 lumen) at its highest setting.</p><p>It has good connectivity over Wi-Fi 6, and I didn't see any issues in this regard. By contrast, I had problems connecting to my Nest Cam Outdoor, and it would regularly glitch out when I pulled up the feed to view who's at the door. There are no such issues with the Elite Floodlight, and its motion detection along with zone intrusion alerts combined with local storage give it a definite edge.</p><p>I have the Elite Floodlight mounted outside the front door, and its IP66 ingress protection has proven to be reliable in India's monsoon weather. Setting it up was straightforward, and Reolink's mobile app is good in its own right. Best of all, as it delivers an RTSP stream, it's easy to link the camera to an NVR without any hassle.</p><p>In addition to the Elite Floodlight, I've been using the Atlas, a battery camera with a 2K lens and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity. The Atlas comes with a solar panel, alleviating the need to dismount it and charge the device. The Atlas misses out on RTSP, so I have it set up in a balcony that doesn't get much use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="67WnGnEpa8bN3nCsuCYQ5a" name="Reolink Argus" alt="Reolink Argus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/67WnGnEpa8bN3nCsuCYQ5a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Reolink also has a cloud-based tier that lets you store footage, but given that its cameras have built-in MicroSD slots, I didn't see the point of leveraging the feature. While I generally don't like using MicroSD storage, it has been decent enough in the three months I used the Elite Floodlight and Atlas, and I didn't run into any issues. If you are interested in saving footage in the cloud, Reolink uses the industry-standard AES encryption when data is in transit.</p><p>The biggest reason I switched to Reolink cameras is the ease of access; it would take anywhere between five to 10 seconds to load the footage after pulling up the feed on my Nest cameras, and it's considerably faster on the Elite Floodlight and Atlas. I can view the feed within a few seconds. With the footage going out to my NVR, I'm able to store 24/7 recording for as long as I need (I set it to 90-day intervals).</p><p>Another positive with Reolink is the affordability. The Atlas c<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Altas-Solar-Pre-Record-Subscription/dp/B0F1YGLF7S">osts $135 as of writing</a>, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Elite-Floodlight-WiFi-Adjustable/dp/B0DWSJVXJH">Elite Floodlight available for $197 on Amazon</a>. Considering there's no fee to access footage, that's a pretty great value when you consider the rest of the feature-set.</p><p>With these cameras set up, I'm looking to get my hands on additional Reolink cameras; the brand makes PoE products as well, and that's what I'm interested in picking up next. Overall, Reolink has proven to be the ideal alternative to Nest, and the flexibility combined with the feature-set makes the brand my go-to recommendation.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="76caa940-cdac-4798-b127-1a2f3476cfa0">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Altas-Solar-Pre-Record-Subscription/dp/B0F1YGLF7S" data-model-name="Reolink Atlas" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:87.45%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pSfaZD6Wn59G4HcPk6d9A.jpg' alt="Reolink Atlas"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Reolink Atlas</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Atlas is a great starting point if you need a new camera; it has good coverage, the 2K lens delivers clean imagery, and it doesn't cost much. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="00c198c0-abec-43f0-9395-1d7407579a8d">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Elite-Floodlight-WiFi-Adjustable/dp/B0DWSJVXJH" data-model-name="Reolink Elite Floodlight " ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:67.93%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/efN88bMijTgaExX4VgovLU.jpg' alt="Reolink Elite Floodlight "></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Reolink Elite Floodlight </div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Elite Floodlight is my go-to choice if you need a camera with built-in illumination.
