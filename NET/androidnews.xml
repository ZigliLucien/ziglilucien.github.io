It's been a couple of weeks since the Pocket DS was first announced, but in true AYANEO fashion, we didn't know the price until today.</p><p>So without further delay, here's what the Pocket DS will set you back, depending on the configuration:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="mXa3mKZRX9Gjp3hPykpZYZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-render-all-colors-2" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mXa3mKZRX9Gjp3hPykpZYZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3584" height="2014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>AYANEO Pocket DS Model</p></th><th  ><p>IGG Early Bird</p></th><th  ><p>Retail Price</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>8GB/128GB (Shadow Black)</p></td><td  ><p>$399</p></td><td  ><p>$519</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>12GB/256GB (Shadow Black)</p></td><td  ><p>$439</p></td><td  ><p>$559</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>16GB/512GB (Shadow Black)</p></td><td  ><p>$499</p></td><td  ><p>$619</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>16GB/1TB (Starry Yellow)</p></td><td  ><p>$599</p></td><td  ><p>$719</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>16GB/1TB (Retro Gray)</p></td><td  ><p>$639</p></td><td  ><p>$759</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Shortly after the price was announced, the Pocket DS Indiegogo campaign went live, meaning you can get your pre-orders in now. According to AYANEO, shipping is set to commence sometime in October, provided there aren't any delays or issues in production.</p><p>Speaking of which, AYANEO also shared a bit more in regards to <em>how</em> it plans to ship the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneos-pocket-ds-will-easily-handle-emulation-from-nes-to-switch-and-everything-in-between">Pocket DS</a>. Essentially, the company is going from "high to low," shipping the 16GB/1TB models first, before making their way to the lower tier configurations. This doesn't come as much of a surprise, but at least we have a better explanation as opposed to being kept in the dark.</p><h2 id="welcome-software-changes-2">Welcome software changes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1839px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="M7FJQ7SrvmXbXpNXRxiCUN" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-three-finger-gesture-demo" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS three-finger gesture demo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M7FJQ7SrvmXbXpNXRxiCUN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1839" height="1034" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Seeing as the Pocket DS is the first dual-screen gaming handheld, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">AYANEO </a>is taking the opportunity to try and get things right from top to bottom. During the livestream, the company detailed a few software tweaks and changes that are in development in order to fully maximize having a dual-screened device.</p><p>The first of which is utilizing a three-finger gesture to move content from one screen to the other. This should remove a lot of potential headaches when you're trying to get your screen layout setup just the way you want. Helping with this, the Pocket DS will have three "Dual-Screen Modes" baked into the software; Independent Display, Main Screen Only, and Second Screen Only.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

Current AYANEO handhelds have the "AYASpace" launcher, which mostly works fine, but obviously isn't optimized for a dual-screen handheld.</p><p>That said, the new DS Launcher has some obvious features like an App Drawer and Card-Style multitasking. But AYANEO is also adding the ability to quickly control the second screen with a bar similar to what you'll find on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. Plus, the Quick Control Center and Quick Settings are both being revamped with relevant settings and feature options.</p><h2 id="one-more-thing-2">"One More Thing"</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2645px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="MWqTEJ4mSFAKFDBUeiTJFZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-render-retro-gray-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MWqTEJ4mSFAKFDBUeiTJFZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2645" height="1486" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That wasn't everything that AYANEO shared during the livestream, as the company had "One More Thing" to show off, and that's a third color option. Initially, the Pocket DS was slated to come in "Shadow Black" and "Starry Yellow," but there's also now a limited edition "Retro Gray" added to the mix.</p><p>The Retro Gray is inspired by the likes of the NES and Game Boy with its matte gray finish and DMG-colored buttons. Besides that (and a higher price tag), it's exactly the same as the other models, but with a catch.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="h67PAMoB9LLvkTYjy65EmZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-render-retro-gray-4" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h67PAMoB9LLvkTYjy65EmZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3584" height="2014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="48SR8DTiXK58vEyKhFEmbZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-render-shadow-black-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/48SR8DTiXK58vEyKhFEmbZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3584" height="2014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2645px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="unwBcU96epiiwwws6PK2vY" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-render-starry-yellow-shadow-black-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/unwBcU96epiiwwws6PK2vY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2645" height="1486" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2645px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="YAr3d2fmH8MwLACd9bJk3Z" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-render-starry-yellow-2" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YAr3d2fmH8MwLACd9bJk3Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2645" height="1486" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2645px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="iHVoZozuUy3Y5TAW6QAW9Z" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-render-starry-yellow-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iHVoZozuUy3Y5TAW6QAW9Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2645" height="1486" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As is the case with the Starry Yellow, the Retro Gray is only available in the 16GB/1TB configuration.

Today, AYN is sending waves through the gaming handheld space with its announcement of the AYN Thor and Odin 3.</p><p>It started with nothing more than a teaser image over at Instagram, simply confirming that the AYN Odin 3 and Thor were upcoming handhelds. This led to a bunch of excitement and chatter in the community about what "Thor" could possibly be.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEzXQkmSWuY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>As luck would have it, we didn't have to wait too long, as AYN published a video to its YouTube channel confirming that Thor is a dual-screen clamshell Android handheld. In the almost 40-second trailer, besides the design, not too much else is revealed about what Thor might have in store.</p><p>We do see that it will feature active cooling and that it will be powered by a Snapdragon processor. However, there's no indication as to what chip this will be. Considering that it's a new product category for AYN, that likely means Thor won't make use of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which headlined all three Odin 2 handhelds.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1758px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="u2udpBiGp9aCTTKkafjREa" name="ayn-thor-teaser-video-3" alt="AYN Thor Dual-screen Racing Render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u2udpBiGp9aCTTKkafjREa.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1758" height="989" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1689px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3duRcaGuTWmtCCDbaKQSEa" name="ayn-thor-teaser-video" alt="AYN Thor Hero Teaser Render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3duRcaGuTWmtCCDbaKQSEa.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1689" height="950" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="d4tZDcwwZFJbuTwAV4PAFa" name="ayn-thor-teaser-video-2" alt="AYN Thor Snapdragon Teaser Render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d4tZDcwwZFJbuTwAV4PAFa.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1754" height="986" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1772px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="2eCaRcMmDuhNazUudJMoFa" name="ayn-thor-teaser-video-4" alt="AYN Thor Teaser - Hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2eCaRcMmDuhNazUudJMoFa.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1772" height="996" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Toss in the fact that we don't know what the Odin 3 will be powered by, and there's just simply no telling what we might end up with. In September 2024, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OdinHandheld/comments/1frhevu/odin_3_with_sd8gen5so_2026/">random rumor appeared</a> suggesting that the Odin 3 "uses 8gen5," and given that the 8 Gen 4 was renamed to the 8 Elite, this could mean the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">8 Elite Gen 2</a>. But again, that was almost a year ago, so I wouldn't be surprised if AYN changed its mind since then.</p><p>Unfortunately, until AYN reveals more information (or leaks crop up), it's nothing but speculation about either the Odin 3 or Thor. Nevertheless, it's interesting to see AYN hold off until <em>after</em> the AYANEO Pocket DS pricing was revealed.</p><p>But if there's one thing that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ds-world-s-1st-dual-screen-android-handheld#/updates/all">Pocket DS Indiegogo campaign</a> has made abundantly clear, it's that people want clamshell Android handhelds. AYANEO raised over $500,000 in under 24 hours, and the company "secured an extra 1,000 Early Bird units."</p><p>Now I just have to wonder how many orders will be cancelled with AYN announcing its own dual-screen handheld.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="bd1b30c5-033b-4448-ae36-a2f054257014">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AYN-Odin-Portal-Handheld-Console/dp/B0F2NF4TQZ" data-model-name="AYN Odin 2 Portal" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ES8UyaWXKKfShA3Y5bKtcE.jpg' alt="AYN Odin 2 Portal render"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">AYN Odin 2 Portal</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Powerhouse OLED Android gaming</strong></em></p><p>AYN has been making some of the best handhelds for years, and with the Odin 2, it pivoted to solely focusing on Android handhelds.

I've already had a few people write in to find out exactly how to do it and why you might want to.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>It's a good question for something more important than you may realize, so let's answer it!</strong></em></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/news-weekly-aug-16-2025">Top stories</a> is one of those sections that shows up at the top of any Google Search results. You might love it or hate it, but that doesn't matter because it's there. You might as well make use of it.</p><p>A good way to do that is to choose where those top stories come from. Usually, Google tries a mix of taking what's relevant <em>and</em> what's popular to decide where search results go, but that doesn't always work best for us. Sometimes, we just want to see what a place we trust has to say. Thankfully, it's pretty simple to set up.</p><ul><li>Open up the <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google home page</a> and search for something you're interested in. I chose the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> as my example.</li><li>At the top, you'll see a section of "<strong>Top stories</strong>" and a little "<strong>+</strong>" icon to its right. Click or tap that icon.</li><li>A new box will pop open that says "<strong>Choose your preferred sources</strong>."</li><li>In the search box, right below the title, <strong>type in the name or home page URL</strong> of a site from which you want to pull news. I typed in <em><strong>Android Central</strong></em><strong>, </strong>but<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/"><strong>www.androidcentral.com</strong></a> would have worked exactly the same.</li><li>You'll see a list of relevant results (in this case, our website and <a href="https://forums.androidcentral.com/" target="_blank">forum</a>) that you can choose from. Pick what you like.</li><li>Finally, click or tap the "<strong>Reload results</strong>" button at the bottom to dismiss the pop-up and reload using your preferences. From now on, every time I search, Android Central will be featured.</li></ul><h2 id="why-you-should-choose-android-central-as-a-preferred-news-source-2">Why you should choose Android Central as a preferred news source</h2><p>There are plenty of great tech and Android websites out there that would be great preferred sources. We think Android Central is one of them.</p><p>We're experts at what we do and we never stop learning more. Whether talking about a new phone in the works, rumors about the next phone in the works. or discussing the Google Ecosystem itself we have you covered for the best news and editorial content.</p><h2 id="why-choosing-a-preferred-site-is-important-2">Why choosing a preferred site is important</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-now-brief-news" alt="Now Brief News on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's time for a little bit of "inside baseball." What you see when you do a web search probably isn't what you think it is because of what's called SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</p><p>It's an entire industry developed around getting search results near the top of search engines like Google, and it's huge. It can be a good thing, but like all good things, it can be easily abused.</p><p>Have you ever searched for something and ended up at a link that's just a lot of garbage or short blurbs pulled from other websites? Someone tried really hard to make that happen by paying close attention to the way search engines use keywords and relevant topics. If you put the right words in the right places, you can make your way to the front page of Google without actually writing anything.</p><p>News websites try to fight it by balancing content with the right keywords in a way that isn't going to trigger anything from the search engine that would look bad. Companies like Google fight hard against disingenuous SEO techniques because you don't want to end up on a junk website. They're constantly changing the science behind how this works, but SEO factories are working just as hard to stay a step ahead of the changes.</p><p>In the end, both the end-users and the legitimate news websites are the ones getting the short end of the stick. As a news website, we're constantly monitoring how we can get quality articles out there so you can easily find them. Sometimes, it doesn't work as well as we'd like. Every legitimate website goes through this.</p><p>If you want to see what Android Central has to say about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-live-blog-2025-pixel-10-pixel-watch-4-android-16-and-gemini">the coming Pixel 10 launch</a>, you want to see that in your results. The same goes for any website and any subject. Now, you'll see articles from the places you want to read and trust the most.</p><p>Making Google work in a way that's better for you is always worth doing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

They were originally expected to be $1000+. The change stems in part from the company accepting lower margins to boost demand — a common tactic for new products. https://t.co/rgkZsDDEek<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1957115174764134906">August 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Over the past year, the mixed reality segment has made one thing clear: price drives adoption. Apple’s $3,500 Vision Pro, even with its advanced features and heavy marketing push, hasn’t gained much traction. Its steep cost is seen as the main hurdle, sending a clear warning to companies like Meta as they get ready to roll out their own AR glasses.</p><p>Meta’s upcoming smart glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-next-gen-ray-ban-hypernova-glasses-semg-bracelet-render-leaks">dubbed "Hypernova,"</a> were first pegged at up to $1,400. The price has now reportedly dropped to around $800, which is said to include an sEMG wristband controller.</p><p>Gurman notes that the lower price is probably just a starting point. Adding prescription lenses or other style options could push the final cost higher.</p><h2 id="more-than-just-shades-2">More than just shades</h2><p>Hypernova glasses are reportedly building on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">Meta’s Ray-Ban</a> and Oakley smart shades, adding a small display on the right lens for alerts and mini-apps. You’ll control them with the sEMG wristband, using apps for photos, media, maps, and notifications. Think of them as a bridge to Meta’s bigger AR plans.</p><p>According to the report, Gurman says Meta’s Hypernova will offer just basic smart glass features. It’s meant as a stopgap, paving the way for Orion, Meta’s full-fledged AR glasses.</p><p>The glasses are set to run a customized version of Android, though they probably won’t have a dedicated app store. Alongside the wristband, you’ll navigate them with taps and swipes on the side frame.</p><p>The lower price suggests Meta is aiming for the mainstream, not just tech enthusiasts willing to splurge on something like the Apple Vision Pro. Whether $800 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> can go beyond a novelty and become a daily essential is still up in the air.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Having tested the COROS NOMAD out myself, I can happily say that it's an intriguing alternative to the popular Garmin Instinct 3, and better in several ways.</p><p>The NOMAD's key perk is its offline street and topographic maps, now improved with street/ trail names and points of interest in case you don't predownload a course.</p><p>Its Ambiq Apollo 510 processor makes map navigation blissfully smooth. Scroll in or out with the crown, or swipe on the touch display to look nearby, and it fills in the details in less than a second, where other fitness watches I've tested have <em>painfully</em> laggy maps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HHWReD7ndfgftvmG4ioeKQ" name="COROS-NOMAD-heart-rate-widget" alt="The COROS NOMAD watch showing a widget with the wearer's current heart rate and the time of day." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HHWReD7ndfgftvmG4ioeKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Old-school fitness watch fans will appreciate that the COROS NOMAD uses a 1.3-inch MIP display. I'm much more of an AMOLED fan, but COROS's colorful, high-contrast take on MIP is respectably readable indoors, once you turn on the gesture backlight, and it's great outdoors.</p><p>But COROS also made the NOMAD feel more modern with its new voice pins. Using the dual noise-canceling mics, you can record your thoughts mid-activity and have each recording pinned to a specific GPS location. It turns your workout summary into a hike diary, with the option to add photos to specific pins and then text the summary to loved ones so they can listen and see for themselves.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="c3JvHaLRiEWgDGjNoJFJUQ" name="COROS-NOMAD-voice-pin-menu" alt="The pin menu that pops up on the COROS NOMAD watch, showing Voice Pin and normal Pin options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c3JvHaLRiEWgDGjNoJFJUQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eBYW3gD5dAXtiv8zZk3gHQ" name="COROS-NOMAD-voice-pin-recording" alt="The COROS NOMAD watch showing a "Recording" screen for a voice pin, with a trailhead visible behind it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eBYW3gD5dAXtiv8zZk3gHQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="RUSrFsDNQdprMspNJTEUMQ" name="COROS-NOMAD-pins-menu" alt="A list of pins on the COROS NOMAD for a hiking activity, including bathroom, hazard, hut, supplies, and trailfork." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUSrFsDNQdprMspNJTEUMQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I tested it out on a local hike, and was happy with the experience.

But I also complained that Garmin should have given a $450+ "adventurer's watch" offline maps and more exclusive outdoor tools, so that battery life wasn't its only trademark.</p><p>Whether you care about the NOMAD's voice pins and fishing tools or not, at least COROS made sure to differentiate it from its other lineups, and didn't price-lock maps like Garmin does. Plus, even if you buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> for mapping, it has more sluggish performance, and navigating with buttons instead of a crown isn't that fun.</p><p>Of course, the Instinct 3 has plenty of upsides over the NOMAD: doubled water depth with a MIL-STD-810 rating, a built-in flashlight, daily suggested workouts, a rucking app, and contactless payments. Most importantly, Garmin offers AMOLED or solar recharging in multiple sizes, where the NOMAD only comes in one MIP variant.</p><p>So it's not to say that the COROS NOMAD is "better" than the Instinct 3. But it's $100–150 cheaper, it's a more dependable navigation aid in emergencies, it helps you preserve memories of your favorite outdoor moments, and its weeks of battery life will be enough for most without solar recharging.</p><h2 id="testing-the-coros-nomad-s-gps-and-hr-accuracy-2">Testing the COROS NOMAD's GPS and HR accuracy</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

Earlier this year, Google said it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-is-dropping-support-for-the-first-two-generations-of-nest-learning-thermostat">would phase out support for some models</a> but promised the 3rd-gen Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Thermostat E would gain controls in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> app by late 2025. The exact timing was unclear, but according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Full-temperature-schedules-for-older-Nest-Thermostats-now-in-the-Google/ba-p/735859" target="_blank">post</a> on the Google Nest Community forum, that update has now arrived.</p><p>It's rolling out first to owners of the older Nest thermostats in the U.S. and UK, finally addressing one of the biggest shortcomings in Google’s smart home setup. While newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a> from Google could already be managed directly in the Home app, older ones still forced users to rely on the separate Nest app just to handle scheduling.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:673px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:127.79%;"><img id="xWXCxTvH9w85PS7Q8szbhn" name="Nest-thermostat-scheduling" alt="scheduling temperatures in 3rd gen Nest Learning Thermostat and the Nest Thermostat E" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xWXCxTvH9w85PS7Q8szbhn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="673" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:674px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:127.60%;"><img id="Fr6R3sm5EEQ6jAYGmgGgen" name="Nest-thermostat-scheduling" alt="scheduling temperatures in 3rd gen Nest Learning Thermostat and the Nest Thermostat E" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fr6R3sm5EEQ6jAYGmgGgen.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="674" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Now, 3rd-gen Nest Learning and Nest E users can set their own schedules from the Home app, and any schedules made in the old Nest app will show up there too. If you’ve got the Learning Thermostat, you’ll also be able to view and use its sensors inside the app.</p><p>Google says the rollout started last week, but not everyone with a Nest thermostat will see the update just yet.</p><h2 id="not-all-nest-thermostats-made-the-cut-2">Not all Nest thermostats made the cut</h2><p>Older models like the first-gen Nest (2011), the second-gen from 2012, and the 2014 European version aren’t included in this update. Google says software support for those devices will officially end on October 25, 2025.</p><p>Alongside the update, Google is giving the Home app a polish across all Nest thermostats. You’ll see brighter colors and clearer labels for heating and cooling, as well as a redesigned energy dashboard that now includes more detailed stats and weekly year-over-year comparisons.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Sorting through millions of hours of audio by hand is not only tedious but nearly impossible at scale. That’s where Perch comes in.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsxZj4zwD_4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The original Perch model, launched in 2023, quickly found its way into tools like Cornell’s BirdNet Analyzer and has already been used by groups such as BirdLife Australia and the Australian Acoustic Observatory. It has helped track endangered species, including uncovering a hidden population of the rarely seen Plains Wanderer, and sped up conservation work in Hawaiʻi by recognizing honeycreeper calls in minutes instead of hours, Google's DeepMind team said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/how-ai-is-helping-advance-the-science-of-bioacoustics-to-save-endangered-species/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>With more than a quarter of a million downloads, the tool proved there’s real demand for AI that can listen.</p><p>Building on that work, Perch 2.0 expands its reach. It’s trained on a larger dataset and can now identify sounds from mammals, amphibians, and even human-made noise.</p><h2 id="eavesdropping-on-ecosystems-2">Eavesdropping on ecosystems</h2><p>The updated model works well in all kinds of environments, from jungles to underwater habitats, and does a better job sorting through messy, overlapping sounds. Beyond simply identifying species, the AI can help estimate how many animals are calling, or even track trends such as birth rates over time.</p><p>Another upgrade is what DeepMind calls “agile modeling.” Instead of requiring massive labeled datasets, scientists can now feed the system just one example of a rare call — say, a juvenile bird or a specific frog species — and Perch will search through its database for similar sounds. This allows researchers to build accurate new classifiers in less than an hour, a process that previously took weeks.</p><p>For conservation projects, these changes mean researchers can spend more time focusing on action rather than slogging through recordings. By putting powerful listening tools directly into the hands of scientists, the model could become an essential part of protecting the planet’s most vulnerable wildlife.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication noticed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bengaluru/comments/1ksmstt/scam_alert_fake_customer_support_numbers/">user on Reddit</a> who reported about a friend who'd gotten roped into a scam over a missing Swiggy Instamart order overseas. Their friend searched for "Swiggy customer care number" and received a phone number; however, it quickly turned into a scam.</p><p>Strangely, the person on the other end (who pretended to be customer support) started asking the user to "share their screen" and accept a "UPI request" (money request). After the call was ended, it became evident that things weren't right. More than that, the user found out that Swiggy Instamart doesn't have a phone number, only chat-based support.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bengaluru/comments/1ksmstt/scam_alert_fake_customer_support_numbers">⚠️ SCAM ALERT – Fake Customer Support Numbers!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bengaluru">r/Bengaluru</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Similarly, Digital Trends chased down another report from Alex Rivlin on Facebook. Rivlin was searching for "royal caribbean customer service phone number 24 hours usa." In an eight-minute video, and as explained in the brief post, Rivlin was looking for information to book a shuttle for a cruise he was preparing for. The number Rivlin received from Google's AI Overviews soon turned out to be false, as it led right to a scammer.</p><p>In his post, Rivlin states, "The scammers mimicked everything perfectly: pricing, terminology, and even the shuttle details. They tricked me into sharing my credit card info, and I spotted the fraud just in time." Rivlin adds, "With AI-generated results and spoofed numbers, the game has changed."</p><p>This has left a very bitter taste in users' mouths, with some in the Facebook post's comments wondering how the scam number got to the "top of Google Search ahead of Royal Caribbean." The Android Authority post highlights a mention from a Google spokesperson in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/15/google-ai-overviews-scam/">Washington Post</a> about this issue. The statement reports that Google is "aware" of the issue and is working to "improve results." Moreover, the company has reportedly "taken action" against a few numbers it has identified.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about these scam numbers in AI Overviews. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="ai-gets-it-wrong-2">AI gets it wrong</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jPNmASUaZBcNT8RFCxw67R" name="google-io-ai-overviews" alt="AI overview stats at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jPNmASUaZBcNT8RFCxw67R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of this AI intelligence rolling out, especially in Search, is <em>supposed to </em>make things easier for users looking up topics and information. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-head-of-search-ai-overview-fix-inbound">as we've seen before</a>, AI can get things wrong. We can make a callback to 2024 when Google's Head of Search, Liz Reid, had to make a statement about the erroneous AI Overviews results that took "nonsensical" and "satirical" a little too seriously. Of course, as Reid stated, the issues stemmed from an "information gap," in which there isn't enough information about a subject, so the AI ends up grasping at straws and makes things up.</p><p>The AI also ended up pulling more "user-generated" content, rather than content from reputable places with solid foundations in information.</p><p>What we're seeing now with the scam numbers isn't quite an "information gap," but it still shows how Google's AI is simply pulling information, as it's not verifying this on its own. As always, with any new AI feature that comes out, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-for-students-educator-features-detailed">users should double-check what the bot has returned</a>. AI Overviews and more typically feature backlinks, which users should take into account when looking up crucial info.</p><p>But there's another reason why this is an issue. It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">all that shitposting people have done</a> over the years.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The post alleges the device could debut with a 5.1mm measurement, which is ever-so-slightly thinner than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">the S10 Ultra</a>, which was 5.4mm in thickness. Speculation states the device could sport a 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED display at a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Some other interesting leaked specifications include an 11,600mAh battery with 45W charging. The tipster then claims the S11 Ultra could feature the following RAM/storage configs: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, and 16/1TB.</p><p>On a more curious note, the leak states the Tab S11 Ultra still features its S Pen. This is something that ties into a recent rendering leak that didn't highlight its typical rear panel holder. Additionally, the post alleges a singular front camera at 12MP.</p><h2 id="still-happening-shortly-2">Still happening "Shortly?"</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">⭕️Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra 5G💥14,6 Inches 💥Dynamic AMOLED 2X,120Hz💥Mediatek Dimensity 9400+ 3nm💥4 headphones💥11,600mAh. 45w💥IP68💥WiFi 7💥Thinness 5,1mm💥12R-256G/512G16R-1T💥OneUI 8💥SPen💥Gemini &all AI features AI💥E-SIM💥13MP+8MP 💥Front 12MP💥Gray-silver pic.twitter.com/MlbsXozZRE<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1955928025473617982">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Many of the leaks we're seeing about the Tab S11 Ultra tie into what we've seen previously, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-battery-specifications-leak">a battery rumor about the tablet</a>. In late May, it was alleged that the device was in for a "battery upgrade," though the rumors couldn't nail down an exact estimation. Some said it could be advertised as ~12,000mAh once it launches, but nothing was clear. Moreover, those rumors said we could see a ~500mAh upgrade, putting the S11 Ultra at around 11,300mAh.</p><p>The current rumors suggest 11,600mAh, so perhaps we're somewhere within these ranges. Then, there were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/leaked-renders-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-galaxy-s25-fe-changes-rumored">the rendering leaks about the device</a> (removed from X) in mid-July that seemingly dropped its S Pen holder on its back. Other interesting changes noted was its Infinity-U display cutout. There was a bit of wonder about whether or not Samsung could keep two lenses or one, and, with these rumors, maybe we're down to one.</p><p>A Samsung exec in July reportedly stated the Galaxy Tab S11 series is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">looking to launch "shortly" following</a> Unpacked.

Moreover, when you first leave a reaction to an image, a dialog box informs the user that these emojis will be shared with Google and shown publicly.</p><p>However, on my device, tapping an emoji does nothing to the image, and there's no way to tell if you've reacted (unless you tap-and-hold it again), as nothing shows up in the UI.</p><p>In Google Messages, if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-double-tap-to-react">react to a message</a>, the emoji shows up below it, but emojis don't appear in Google Maps for now. It's also worth noting that these are the only five emojis available, and there's no way currently to add others.</p><p>There's no official word on what the feature is meant to achieve, but Google likely sees reactions as a quick way to boost engagement on Maps listings. The feature would make it easier for users to quickly share feedback on photos without leaving full reviews.</p><p>The feature doesn't appear to be rolling out widely just yet, as I could spot it working only on my Google Pixel 9 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>, and not on any other Android devices or iPhone. However, since the feature has been spotted, it looks like it could roll out anytime soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now that I'm signed up for the Garmin Tucson marathon in November, just three months out, I have to decide quickly which plan to try. Should I trust a smartwatch algorithm to give me a personalized marathon training plan, or use a running coach plan from TrainingPeaks?</p><p>It's been a few years since I last ran a marathon. When Garmin offered a media invite to run in its first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-marathon-series/">Garmin Marathon series</a>, I knew I'd have to ramp up my mileage quickly, but intelligently, so I don't overtrain and crash out.</p><p>I've reviewed pretty much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">every running watch</a> under the sun, but whether I use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a> or another device, my success or failure will depend on the workout plan, more than the hardware.</p><p>So I decided to sit down and compare every smartwatch marathon training plan, to see which would best prepare me for the Garmin marathon series.</p><h2 id="every-smartwatch-based-marathon-training-plan-for-beginners-2">Every smartwatch-based marathon training plan for beginners</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1906px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8XDsqC2GvZtQN7VdEPPKwL" name="Garmin-intermediate-marathon-training-plan" alt="The Garmin Connect intermediate marathon training plan, highlighting a specific week of training runs: Intervals, recovery, cross-training, intervals, and long run." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8XDsqC2GvZtQN7VdEPPKwL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1906" height="1072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Very few smartwatches recommend long-term training plans.

Fitbit offers daily <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-google-pixel-watch-3-run-coaching">Run Coach recs,</a> but nothing cohesive. Apple Fitness+ focuses on indoor workouts. I only know of a few running watches with proper marathon guidance!</p><p><strong>GARMIN: </strong>Available through Run Coach, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://connect.garmin.com/modern/training-plan?type=Running">Garmin's marathon training plans</a> last 16 weeks. The beginner plan has zone-2 easy runs, zone-4 threshold pace runs, and fartlek runs, with one long run every weekend.</p><p>Between three weekly runs, Garmin recommends two cross-training days per week, for bodyweight exercises, yoga, swimming, or cycling.</p><p>The intermediate plan expects five workouts per week, but isn't that different. It recommends weekly intervals and has more back-to-back run days, plus longer long runs, but still mixes in rest and cross-training days.</p><p>Garmin's training load philosophy emphasizes low aerobic and anaerobic variety to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve VO2 Max</a>, plus strength training to optimize your form. I'm normally all about this philosophy, but frankly, if I'm going to increase my workout days per week and hit my marathon target, I need to spend most of my time focused on mileage. <em>Next</em> marathon, I'll worry about speed and power.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2224px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zb8PBjsVNSeHVandHQna8M" name="Coros-marathon-training-plan" alt="A COROS training hub web page showing a 12-week marathon training calendar, with a month of training runs visible, each with a description of the type and intensity." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zb8PBjsVNSeHVandHQna8M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2224" height="1251" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: COROS)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>COROS: </strong>COROS has 15 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://coros.com/training">marathon training plans</a>, targeting specific finish times or 12-to-20-week schedules.

But nearly every run has you mixing easy pacing with 15-second strides or 400m pickups, eventually progressing to intervals and inverted pyramids. You get more rest days, but rarely take an easy run.</p><p>Either way, COROS emphasizes mileage over cross-training, letting you decide if you want to focus on speed work or how far you're willing to go per week. I'm pretty impressed with what they have to offer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1972px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="YPELSjXS3JRxs7mxHVUKwL" name="Polar-running-program-marathon-training-plan" alt="The Polar Running Program web page showing an algorithmically generated marathon training plan, with set weekly running and cross-training workouts for 14 weeks." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPELSjXS3JRxs7mxHVUKwL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1972" height="1109" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Polar)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>POLAR: </strong>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://flow.polar.com/programs/event-program">Polar running program</a> has you input how many days per week you're willing to run and how long, plus how hard you typically find running.

Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday are reserved for cross-training: Strength, mobility, and core exercises, respectively.</p><p>If you're a Strenuous runner, you swap in a tempo run on Wednesdays and intervals on Saturdays, meaning you're doing three medium-to-hard runs in a row from Friday to Sunday.

You can't simply choose a marathon training plan; if Samsung ranks you lower, you'll have to spend weeks, if not months, leveling up. But if Samsung eventually lets runners pick their target distance and pace manually, however, the Running Coach has a great variety of run types like Fartlek, repetitions, intervals, and long runs that would benefit beginner marathoners.</p><p><strong>AMAZFIT:</strong> Zepp Coach has you choose a target marathon pace and date, then describe your weekly mileage and average pace. With that, it generates a three-month program of easy, hard, interval, fartlek, and long runs, grouped by HR zones or pace depending on your preference.</p><p>It's not the most comprehensive or varied training plan, but it's available for super-cheap watches like the Amazfit Bip 6 or Active 2, which is great for frugal runners.</p><h2 id="which-marathon-training-plan-i-m-going-with-2">Which marathon training plan I'm going with</h2><p>All of these marathon training plans are "free" after you buy your watch, so we can't complain too much if they're a bit limited. You can find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon">thousands of TrainingPeaks marathon plans</a> if you want to pay for something better.</p><p>Personally, after all that searching, I'm leaning toward a straightforward <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/">Hal Higdon novice training plan</a>, which are popular with first-time marathoners. Rather than focus on complicated speedwork or strengthwork, I'll just check off four runs a week of about 20–30 miles and hope for the best.</p><p>I'm a few weeks behind his 18-week schedule, but I'm hoping I can hit the ground running, so to speak, because I've already been training. Then, once I've conquered this Garmin marathon, I can go into another marathon with a more advanced plan.</p><p>But if you have a favorite marathon training plan that helped you hit a PR, I'd love to hear your recommendations in the comments!</p> ]]></dc:content>

Last year, the company introduced its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-5g-launch">NXTPAPER Key</a> to complement its unique displays, and now, we finally get to experience it in the United States with the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER.</p><p>While not a flagship by any means, the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER does stand out from the pack, thanks to the more eye-friendly display that can effectively transform the phone into an e-reader with the flip of a switch. I like to think of it as having a Boox Palma living inside your smartphone, which should appeal to anyone who likes to read but doesn’t want to carry a separate e-reader with them at all times.</p><p>TCL’s current offering isn’t for everyone, but the technology involved is one I would like to see more of.</p><h2 id="tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-specs-2">TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER specs</h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>TCL UI v8 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.78-inches, IPS LCD, FHD+ (1080 X 2460), 120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chip</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 6100 Plus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide/macro</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>5MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>2MP depth</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint (side), facial recognition</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,010mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>18W wired</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>167.6 x 75.5 x 8.22mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>199.5g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Space Blue</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="nxtpaper-display-pros-and-cons-2">NXTPAPER display pros and cons</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UquLiKUu8koiF74UhEiBw9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-02" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER transitioning between normal and Ink mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UquLiKUu8koiF74UhEiBw9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Transitioning between normal and Ink Paper mode. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you hold the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER, you’ll immediately notice why it’s different. The NXTPAPER display is unique in both look and feeling thanks to its very matte display. It feels incredibly soft to the touch, and your hand just glides across the screen with ease. I first thought the phone had a screen protector on it, which is just how unreal the experience is. It's supposed to feel more paper-like, in contrast to the glossy displays found on nearly all other smartphones, and the change comes with some nice benefits.</p><p>Gone are the fingerprints you would find on a traditional smartphone display. TCL’s multi-layer display also filters out 61% more blue light than other devices, so it’s safer on your eyes. While I’m not clear on how this display measures up for those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>, it should still make the viewing experience more comfortable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VnNVKErKAJoMKRdzquprz9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-9" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER eye care settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnNVKErKAJoMKRdzquprz9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Colors are still pretty vibrant when in normal viewing mode, even if the FHD+ LCD panel won’t quite match up to the contrast of an OLED. TCL also has a host of display features aimed at improving visuals and eye comfort. When indoors, I’m pretty pleased with the display overall.</p><p>It’s outdoors where things fall apart a bit. The NXTPAPER display is actually quite challenging to see in direct sunlight, which is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">unfortunate downside of the technology</a>.</p><p>You may also want to be wary of scratches. I’m not quite sure what caused the scratch on my review unit, but it appears much more pronounced than what I've seen on other phones in my years of reviewing devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3415px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8r7jcofndgprsikdDtXgH9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-14" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER display off with a scratch in the top corner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8r7jcofndgprsikdDtXgH9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3415" height="1921" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-5g-launch">NXTPAPER Key</a> is the real star of the show, though, letting you easily switch to one of three other display modes: Ink Paper, Color Paper, and Max Ink.</p><p>The first transforms the phone into a typical black and white ink display, similar to what you’ll see on a Kindle or other e-readers. Color Paper Mode is more or less the same, but adds a dash of warm, muted color to everything, almost as if you’re looking at a '90s TV screen. With these modes, you’re still able to use your phone just like usual.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="27rahYm6TA2HqjmtdToziA" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-15" alt="The NXTPAPER Key on the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27rahYm6TA2HqjmtdToziA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3916" height="2203" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DECywEhWFWXV7CwTfACWCA" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-01" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER display modes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DECywEhWFWXV7CwTfACWCA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9B9aWn8qArho26UBL7rTc9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-08" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER in Ink Paper Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9B9aWn8qArho26UBL7rTc9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MJ2V8bEHYwbSSjhcgNBRKA" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-07" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER in Color Paper Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MJ2V8bEHYwbSSjhcgNBRKA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9zwTMDJGG9gFHLAFoq3eP9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-06" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER apps in Max Ink Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9zwTMDJGG9gFHLAFoq3eP9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3963" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Max Ink Mode emulates the e-reader experience as much as possible for users who want to take a break from the world and just focus on reading.

The keynote is expected to begin at 10 am PT/ 1 pm ET. The event will be livestreamed on Google’s official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Google/videos">YouTube channel</a>, as they do every year.</p><p>For a comprehensive overview of everything we know so far, be sure to check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><u><strong>Pixel 10 Ultimate Guide</strong></u></a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/06b4UeDcQbE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>This year's event is anticipated to feature four devices: the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The phones are expected to get the next-gen Tensor G5 chipset. Additionally, we expect the Pixel Watch 4 in two sizes, powered by Wear OS 6 and its latest UI enhancements. On the accessories front, several rumors indicate a potential launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/pixel-buds-2a-colors-might-not-look-anything-like-the-ones-weve-seen-before">Pixel Buds 2a</a>, along with Pixel-specific accessories allegedly called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-to-allegedly-get-qi2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories"><u>"Pixel Snap."</u></a></p><p>Looks like the Pixel 10 series is shaping up to have four different models this year, keeping up with Google's usual release style. This is backed by some leaked codenames of the devices, likely to show up as:</p><p><em>Pixel 10, codename Frankel</em></p><p><em>Pixel 10 Pro, codename Blazer</em></p><p><em>Pixel 10 Pro XL, codename Mustang</em></p><p><em>Pixel 10 Pro Fold, codename Rango</em></p><p>Google might not radically change the overall design for its upcoming flagship; however, it is giving the base model a much-needed boost. The Pixel 10 will finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">feature a triple rear camera array</a>, which could include a 50MP main, a 12MP ultrawide, and a 10.8MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. Other alleged specs include a larger battery, a 6.3-inch 120Hz OLED display with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">improved brightness and PWM dimming,</a> 12GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:832px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26" name="google-play-store-pixel-10-promo-leaked" alt="A leaked image of the entire Pixel 10 series (in moonstone and indigo), as leaked via a Play Store discovery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="832" height="464" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the base<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats"> Pixel 10’s colors</a>, Google seems to be mixing things up on that front as well. A recent leak showcasing renders of the Pixel 10 hinted at four fresh color options: Obsidian, Frost, Indigo, and Limoncello.</p><p>Obsidian is the usual black, Limoncello is the yellow-green combo we've seen in earlier leaks; Indigo looks a lot like the Bay blue but brighter, and Frost lands somewhere between light blue and a soft purple tint.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we’re on the topic of hues, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats"><u>rumor hinted at the fact</u></a> that Google could be tying certain colors to the device’s storage options. Strange, yet a smart move by Google! What better way to entice a user to grab a higher storage option? We’ve already told you the base variant’s colorways.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro and the Pro XL are getting their color lineup: Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade. As for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, you’ll only get two picks: Moonstone or Jade.</p><p>So, to break things down, if you’re eyeing the Pixel 10 Pro in Jade finish, you might have to reach for the 256GB model. The same goes for the Pro XL. And if you're leaning toward the foldable Pro in Jade, you might not get the 1TB. The Pixel 10 Pro XL in Porcelain and Moonstone might not even see the 1TB option. On the other hand, the Obsidian version could still come in 128GB, thankfully.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Model</p></th><th  ><p>Color</p></th><th  ><p>Storage Configurations</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Frost</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Indigo</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Lemongrass</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Porcelain</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Porcelain</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-xl-large-and-in-charge-major-leak-weeks-before-launch">Pixel 10 Pro and the bigger Pro XL </a>might see key variations when compared to their predecessors.

In the post titled "PD" (Pixel Drop), we get a good look at the alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> in some of its rumored colorways. Blass also shared images of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> in a grey colorway (supposedly called Moonstone). Additionally, Blass posted videos showing the Pixel 10 Pro with a clear look at the camera bar, the power button, and the volume controls.</p><p>Blass seems to be<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/another-pixel-10-series-leak-info-on-specifications-buds-2a"><u> unstoppable with these Pixel 10 leaks</u></a>. In a subsequent X post last week, they shared images detailing some of the specifications for all three devices, and one of these images claims that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-xl-large-and-in-charge-major-leak-weeks-before-launch">the Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> will feature a 6.8-inch Super Actua display. And the rumored large 5,200 mAh battery could last on a single charge for  ~24 hours or more. Additionally, the RAM size for the device could be capped at 16GB.</p><p>The tipster also alleges the 10 Pro XL will feature 8K video recording capabilities and a 42MP selfie camera. The triple array on the back is rumored to consist of a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide lens, and a 48MP telephoto with 100x zoom. Blass also doubled down on the fact that not much will change with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p>Moving things along, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to feature a 6.4-inch 120Hz cover display and an 8-inch OLED main display, with about 3,000 nits of peak brightness. Google is reportedly working on tweaking the hinge on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. This should make the bezel around the cover screen much sleeker giving users more screen space(6.4 inches vs. 6.3), and also make it sleeker to hold on to.</p><p>Google doesn’t seem to be getting into the “we make the slimmest foldable” race yet, as alleged images of the foldable online don’t show any drastic reduction in the width of the phone.</p><p>While the tech giant isn’t making the slimmest foldable out there, rumors indicate that it could be making the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect"><u>foldable to get the IP68 water and dust resistance rating,</u></a> which could be a game-changer, as the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might be “dust-tight” meaning no dust can penetrate and potentially damage internal components, and could be protected against submersion in water beyond 1 meter. Which is a pretty neat feature to have on an expensive device like this one.</p><p>The device is expected to feature a battery bump, showcasing a 5,000mAh battery, which offers 23W wired and 15W wireless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-to-allegedly-get-qi2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories">charging with Qi2</a>, which is another first for a foldable device on the market.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will also reportedly be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> 3nm chipset. However, things remain unchanged when it comes to the phone's camera. As for its camera array, the fold is rumored to sport a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera. It will also have 10-megapixel selfie cameras on the cover as well as the main display.</p><p>As for the device's storage, the phone might see a higher 1TB option of this foldable; however, these storage options could also be linked to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">color users choose for their device.</a> The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to show up in Moonstone and Jade colorways.</p><p>Another X to post showcased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1953493258358661438/video/1"><u>alleged promo video</u></a> of the Pixel 10 Fold, showing us a close-up of its hinge as well as how the device would look when unfolded, in its Moonstone (grey) colorway. The video also gave us a quick look at the rear panel housing the camera setup of the Fold, which looks very similar to its predecessor.</p><p>While we were on the fence about this very official-looking video from Blass, Google dropped a surprise tease of its Pixel 10 Pro Fold that we didn’t see coming this early on…</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dbHJ5cMcCGriMRdKQmMRsA" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-pixel-8-pro-pixel-7-pro-back-1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Pixel 8 Pro and 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbHJ5cMcCGriMRdKQmMRsA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With Google detailing the design of the Pixel 10 series to get ahead of the leaks, there isn’t much we don’t know in that area.

That said, the node shift and changes to the underlying architecture should deliver sizable gains across the board.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wWstzago54eeRYsUVi8uza" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-holding-in-front-of-pool" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wWstzago54eeRYsUVi8uza.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google isn’t set to change too many things when it comes to the cameras on the Pixel 10 Pro models, with the Pixel 10 Pro likely to retain the same 50MP sensor as last year. We should also see the same 48MP wide-angle lens, and a 50MP tele lens with 5x optical zoom.</p><p>That said, Google has proven time and again that it knows how to tune the cameras on its phones to deliver the best possible photos and videos, and that is bound to be the case in 2025 as well. While Chinese manufacturers have switched to massive 1-inch modules to differentiate their phones, Google could once again leverage its machine learning smarts to maintain its advantage.</p><p>Where Google needs to roll out considerable upgrades is the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. While the Pixel 9 Pro Fold continues to be a great foldable, it just doesn’t have the cameras to measure up against its rivals. Google nailed the sizing of the device, and the software is a delight to use, but the cameras are underwhelming to say the least, and this is something that needs addressing this year.<br><br>With the Vivo X Fold 5, Galaxy Z Fold 7, and the Honor Magic V5 showcasing what’s possible with foldable cameras, Google needs to show that it can also deliver standout cameras on its upcoming phone.</p><p>Apart from Google’s flagship Pixel 10 series, the next generation of the Pixel Watch will also launch at this year’s Made by Google event set to take place on Aug. 20 in New York. And rumor has it that the Pixel Watch 4 could see some significant upgrades compared to its predecessor. <br><br>In April, we were privy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">alleged renders of the Pixel Watch 4</a>, showcasing what the smartwatch would look like. And right off the bat, the one thing that was seemingly noticeable is that the new Pixel Watch 4 could be 2mm thicker than the Pixel Watch 3. Without any drastic changes, it could retain its same round-dome display, but it appears to have even smaller bezels than the Watch 3. While the Watch 3 had 1.27- and 1.43-inch displays, we may be closer to the same 1.3- and 1.5-inch screen on the new watch.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 could finally be getting a bump in the chip that runs it. The Pixel Watch 2 and 3 use the 4nm Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chipset with Arm cores, which also powers the OnePlus Watch 3. However, this time around, Qualcomm hinted at a new and improved chipset that could power the Pixel Watch 4.<br><br>When AC’s Senior Editor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="mailto:michael.hicks@futurenet.com"><u>Michael Hicks</u></a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025"><u>spoke to the Qualcomm VP of wearables</u></a>, Dino Bekis, about the Qualcomm-Google partnership, he discussed the "feature-focused" and "AI-driven" Snapdragon Wear chipset coming in 2025, coinciding with the Pixel Watch 4 launch. According to Bekis, this chip would deliver "more compute capability" and "headroom" for a significant boost over the current Gen 1. Additionally, he added that they were also focused on giving the chip "a week's worth of battery life" for Wear OS, which means you don’t have to reach for your charger as often.</p><p>While leaks only give us what <em>might </em>show up on the wearable, there’s one thing we can definitely say will make it to the Pixel Watch 4. It will come fully equipped with the stable Wear OS 6. This means the watch will feature the latest Material 3 Expressive UI, bringing more fluid scrolling, buttons, and notification cards that shrink closer to the display edge while still displaying information, and buttons that expand when tapped. With the new OS, users will be able to get dynamic watch faces and themes, along with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-6-will-bring-facer-back-onto-android-watches">third-party watch faces</a>.</p><p>Which means users can heavily personalize and style the Pixel Watch 4 in their unique way.</p><p>Speaking of personalization, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-leak-gemini-ready-personal-assistance-suggestions?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dhfacebook&utm_content=null&fbclid=IwY2xjawMMWiZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETF3UFJkdW10YmtEdkl4NVFMAR7Z8sGVGtjQUyvRWJE8JdyuguUZdjQhf9NNvnPy-zlvgnuSwsJ9T8muxftokw_aem_NNGUu3aTsnbCYS1cCs-_zQ"><u>word on the street</u></a> is the Pixel Watch 4 will use Google's Gemini, which should bring some new tricks to the wearable. A recent leak suggested that the Pixel Watch 4 will come with a "quick AI assistant" for whatever you need.</p><p>Plus, the leaked images and text showed that Gemini will offer "personalized help." This points to a really advanced understanding of your habits, preferences, and what you're doing, so the watch can give you advice and suggestions tailored just for you. One of the most exciting bits of this personalization is the "text suggestions" that "sound like you." This means Gemini will actually learn your unique writing style, making it more authentic, rather than making you sound like a robot.</p><p>As for the Pixel Watch 4’s other features, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-leak-gemini-ready-personal-assistance-suggestions?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dhfacebook&utm_content=null&fbclid=IwY2xjawMMWiZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETF3UFJkdW10YmtEdkl4NVFMAR7Z8sGVGtjQUyvRWJE8JdyuguUZdjQhf9NNvnPy-zlvgnuSwsJ9T8muxftokw_aem_NNGUu3aTsnbCYS1cCs-_zQ"><u>prominent tipster Evan Blass says</u></a> that Google will equip the wearable with “40 plus exercise modes," as well as the ability to build "custom run plans."  It will also come with the “Loss of Plus” just like the Pixel Watch 3, which will alert emergency services on your behalf if it doesn’t read your heartbeat for an extended period of time.</p><p>Aside from these, Blass claims that the Pixel Watch 4 would get health sensor capabilities, like ECG, breathing rate, and HRV.</p><p>The design of the Watch will be familiar; however, it may come with some tweaks. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-leaked-charging-cable-dock-rumor"><u>Another rumor</u></a> indicated that the Pixel Watch 4 will have a familiar rotating crown and side button on the right edge. However, it could come with two new buttons on the left as the leaked renders show two small cutouts or bumps on the left side, flanking the speaker slit. While some sources refer to them as "buttons," others speculate they these grooves might be charging contacts for a rumored new "side-mounted" charging system. <br><br>The Pixel Watch 4 is expected to come in two sizes, much like its predecessor, i.e., 41mm and 45mm. However, considering the Watch may be slightly thicker, we assume that this could be due to a bigger battery that is expected to power the Pixel Watch 4.</p><p>Both sizes are rumored to get a battery capacity increase, with the 41mm model getting a 7% boost and a 327 mAh battery, while the 45mm variant will get a 9% increase in capacity and a 459 mAh battery. As for the device’s charging speeds, it is expected to get 25% faster charging than its predecessors, possibly due to the rumored side-mounted charging system.</p><p>Leaks suggest the 41mm model will last up to 30 hours, and the 45mm model will last up to 40 hours.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-leaked-charging-cable-dock-rumor"><u>Android Headlines</u></a>, Google has moved the watch's charging pins to the left side of its body (remember those two new button-like grooves we just spoke about). The post states that the left side will feature an "indentation" with "two charging contacts" inside. Now, it's expected that the Pixel Watch 4 will sit on its left side to charge, meaning the display can now face users, almost like a tiny clock. Pretty neat, huh?</p><p>This new “charging dock,” as the website calls will be included in the box, but without the USB-C adapter. This charger might also be separately available via the Google store and could cost around $30.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is also rumored to get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/new-pixel-watch-4-leak-reveals-clearer-shots-of-its-upgraded-sensors-and-charging-setup"><u>“Gen-3 Sensor Hub,</u></a>” which is a new, upgraded system of sensors within the smartwatch. Its main function is to more precisely and accurately track the user’s fitness parameters when compared to the previous iteration.</p><p>Beyond more precise monitoring of heart rate, sleep, and workouts, this new hub will supposedly have a new feature called "Breathing Emergencies" that continuously tracks blood oxygen levels and alerts the user if they fall below a safe threshold—a significant upgrade from previous models.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 will supposedly show up with the same chipset as its predecessor, the Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Gen 1; however, Google will likely add a new co-processor — a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/should-you-wait-for-the-google-pixel-watch-4"><u>Google M55 co-processor</u></a>. This co-processor is said to help with AI-related tasks, making it capable of delivering "5x the AI workload at a fraction of the power."<br><br>The Gen 3 sensor hub is also rumored to work in tandem with this new co-processor, which will be crucial for the deep integration of Gemini, making the watch more responsive, whilst reducing battery drain.</p><p>I know you’re kinda getting the drift that this Pixel Watch 4 could be a good upgrade considering all the above specs. But now you're probably wondering about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-is-center-stage-colors-design-renders-leaked"><u>smartwatch’s colors</u></a>. X user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/bedros_p/status/1953022844410990973">Bedros Pamboukian</a> posted a link to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gist.github.com/bedros-p/e3b2fc68922598dc699ae6b74eb7fab3">GitHub repository</a> where they've allegedly discovered the Pixel Watch 4 in all its colors.</p><p>The tipster's repository suggests the device will launch with four watch band colors and three main body 41mm variations. Those colors are as follows: Iris (silver body), Lemongrass (brass body), Porcelain, and Obsidian (obsidian body). And its 45mm version is said to get a Moonstone, Porcelain, and Obsidian.</p><p>Perhaps the most pressing question on your mind is the cost of this new wearable. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/turns-out-the-pixel-watch-4s-price-tag-isnt-half-bad"><u>According to a recent leak</u></a>, the Wi-Fi Pixel Watch 4 models in both 41mm and 45mm are expected to stick with last year’s pricing—$349 and $399, respectively.<br><br>On the flip side, the LTE models might show up at a cheaper price. The leak claims that the wearable might drop by $50 compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>. We’re expecting the 41mm LTE version to land at $399, and the same goes for the 45mm LTE model, which could drop to $449 from $499. Plus, the buzz is that snagging a Pixel Watch 4 could get you six months of Fitbit Premium and a month of YouTube Premium, totally free.</p><p>If you’re someone who’s waiting to get your hands on the Pixel Watch 4, you might have to wait until October. A report from the German publication WinFuture claims to have heard from industry “sources” that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/report-allege-pixel-10-pro-fold-pixel-watch-4-shipping-delays-issues"><u>Google has reportedly run into “supply chain issues,”</u></a> which could delay the market availability of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a by roughly two months. So, this delay isn't just in one region, which means tariffs probably aren't the issue. We assume it could be more likely due to shipping holdups. But it looks like you can still pre-order the Pixel Watch 4 after Google's event on August 20, but you may have a long wait ahead of you.</p><p>An interesting upgrade coming to the Pixel 10 is Qi 2 charging tech. A new leak <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-to-allegedly-get-qi2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories">detailed a Pixelsnap charging accessory</a>, and it reinforces the idea that the upcoming phones will get Qi 2 tech as standard.</p><p>We’ll need to see how Google integrates the tech inside the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL; while Samsung also says its Galaxy S25 devices are Qi 2 ready, you’ll need to use a dedicated case with the requisite magnets to enable the charging tech. Google stands to win out if it manages to integrate the tech natively into the Pixel 10 without having to resort to cases.</p><p>Talking about charging, the Pixel 10 could finally get an upgrade in this area. Google lags behind its Chinese rivals, but it may be looking to switch things up. A new leak indicates Google is readying a 67W charger with two charging ports, so there’s a real possibility that the Pixel 10 models will get a much-needed charging boost. It’s unlikely the devices will switch to the 67W protocol, but any gains in this regard will be a bonus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2njDNuewuPKrSJYC7qLx8X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2njDNuewuPKrSJYC7qLx8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A big part of why Google accelerated the Android 16 launch window was to have the stable build available ahead of the Pixel 10 debut, and it’s a good bet that the phones will have Android 16 pre-installed. While there isn’t much new with Android 16 — at least in the context of major features — that’s set to change in the coming months as Google rolls out its UI overhaul.</p><p>Google isn’t changing the device sizes this year. The teaser page on its store lists the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL, with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold listed as coming later. Google followed a similar launch cadence last year where it launched the regular phones, with the foldable debuting after two months.</p><p>That means we should see the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro retain the same 6.3-inch size as last year’s models, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL should get a 6.8-inch panel. While the sizing and design isn’t too different to last year, the switch to Tensor G5 should be quite exciting, and we’ll have to wait and see if the leaks around increased battery size and Qi 2 charging prove to be legitimate.</p><p>Morning AC Fam! We’re just about a day away from Google’s next big event that’s set to take place in New York tomorrow. Throughout the week, the tech giant has been dropping some slick details about its August 20 event for the tenth generation of Pixels. In an X post, the company states that this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-teaser-gemini-photography-features"><u>year’s launch will be star-studded,</u></a> with the host of The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon, the Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry, British racer Lando Curry, the Jonas Brothers, and more in attendance. <br><br>You can tune into the live broadcast on<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Google/featured"><u> Google’s YouTube channel </u></a>or take a peek at our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><u>Pixel 10 Ultimate Guide</u></a> for real-time updates.</p><p>Over the past few days, rumors about the Pixel 10 series have become increasingly accurate, or so it seems. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-cases-leak"><u>Official first-party cases</u></a> set to debut alongside the new smartphones have leaked, and while the cases look very similar to those from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9 series</a> from last year, the leaked images reveal that a magnetic ring on Pixel 10 cases for the rumored Qi2 wireless charging support.<br><br>So far, every other Pixel 10 rumor we’ve come across has indicated that these new devices will incorporate Qi2 wireless charging technology directly into their design.

Dutch website <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/Google-Pixel-10">Nieuwemobiel</a> shared images of the entire collection of cases for the Pixel 10 series, which will be available at launch. The leaked lineup includes cases for both the Pixel 10 and the Pixel 10 Pro XL, showing the color options each model will get.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">Pixel 10 cases</a> might come in Indigo, Obsidian, Limoncello, and Frost, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL cases will be available in Moonstone, Jade, and Porcelain. If you look at the images, these cases keep a similar design as before, offering a minimal look, fabric-like texture, and the signature “G” logo on the back. But what’s different is the ring on the rear panel, which is what’s getting us excited!</p><p>Qi2 on the Pixel 10 series sounds great, but what will those chargers even look like? So the chatter is that Google is supposedly working on an exclusive range of Qi2 chargers under the name “Pixel Snap.”</p><p>A leak from Android Authority in June stated that the new Pixel 10 series could be snapped onto these wireless magnetic chargers, much like Apple’s MagSafe chargers. The publication further claims that there are three accessories in the works: a Pixelsnap charger, a Pixelsnap charger with a stand, and a Pixelsnap Ring Stand.</p><p>Judging by the names of these chargers, it is safe to assume that the “Pixelsnap Charger” is likely a basic wireless charger, with a disc that snaps onto the back of your device. While the “Pixelsnap Charger with Stand” could be an accessory that keeps the phone upright, allowing you to use your phone while it's charging, it could look a little like the Pixel stand with Qi2 compatibility.</p><p>As for the "Pixelsnap Ring stand," it could be a ring-like charging accessory that could function as a stand as well. That said, since Pixel 10 devices will reportedly have magnetic Qi2 built-in,  it could potentially be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">compatible with MagSafe accessories</a> such as chargers, power banks, wallets, and other accessories without relying on third-party magnetic cases.</p><p>Taking a break from Qi2 for a bit to talk about the Google Pixel Buds 2a. It wasn’t until last month that we heard Google could be launching another pair of earbuds this year.</p><p>Reliable leaker Arsène Lupin spilled some deets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1940848330839654705">on X</a>, and they suggest that Google is getting ready to launch the next addition to its budget-friendly earbuds lineup — the Pixel Buds 2a. As per the leak, the Pixel Buds 2a are coming in a fresh set of colors we've never seen before.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Pixel Buds 2aHazel, Strawberry, Iris, Fog Light<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1940848330839654705">July 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The Pixel Buds 2a will arrive in new shades—Fog Light, Hazel, Iris, and Strawberry. And with the OG Pixel Buds A-series dating back to June 2021, this much-needed splash of color is coming in hot (and overdue).</p><p>The Pixel Buds 2a aren’t the only ones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/pixel-buds-2a-colors-might-not-look-anything-like-the-ones-weve-seen-before"><u>getting a splash of color</u></a>. The same leaker claims the existing Pixel Buds Pro 2 will drop in a new color with the new Pixel 10. And word on the street is they might even come in a cool “Sterling” color to match the phone. However, Lupin didn’t reveal anything about the specs of the Pixel Buds 2a, which we would eventually get from another leak a few days later.</p><p>Another leak pretty much gave us official-looking renders of these alleged earbuds, which showcase the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/new-leak-shows-off-rumored-pixel-buds-2a-weeks-ahead-of-launch"><u>Pixel Buds 2a in an Iris colorway</u></a>, similar to the Pixel 9a color. The image reveals the Pixel Buds 2a comfortably placed inside the signature oval case.</p><p>However, it looks like the insides of the case could also get a splash of color to match the Buds, which is a first. If you look closer, you notice that they have new microphone cutouts, suggesting that Google could finally bring ANC to these buds, a step up from its predecessor.</p><p>We finally get some info about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/new-leak-shows-off-rumored-pixel-buds-2a-weeks-ahead-of-launch"><u>Pixel Buds 2a’s specs</u></a>, thanks to a leak from Android Headlines. From the looks of the renders, these new buds are pretty much sticking to the design of the old ones: still stemless, rounded in-ear buds chilling in an oval charging case. Google might tweak the design a bit to make them fit even better.</p><p>The Pixel Buds 2a's battery life could get a boost when compared to the original budget earbuds, and it might also come with enhanced sound quality. Google might price these new earbuds in line with its budget offering, but since they could have ANC and other new features, they might slightly bump the cost by a notch.</p><p>We got more intel about the Pixel Buds 2 Pro. The leak suggests that these earbuds could now launch in two colorways: Moonstone and Sterling. Evan Blass<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-leak-shows-signs-of-magnetic-qi2-charging-finally-arriving"> doubled down </a>on the Buds Pro 2 rumors, posting what looks like official marketing images of these earbuds on X.</p><p>The images from Blass show the alleged Buds 2 Pro show them off in a "Moonstone" color, nestled in a super clean white charging case. They even got their hands on a cool lifestyle shot showing someone actually wearing the Pixel Buds 2 Pro. What's neat about this one is you can clearly see the subtle yet distinct "G" logo engraved on the outside of each earbud, making these leaks tough to dismiss.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/oJv38zaVFL<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1950291439570583746">July 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Another leaker, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rquandt.bsky.social">Roland Quandt</a>, shared what appear to be renders of the upcoming Pixel Buds 2a. The renders show the buds in the same Iris color as before and could be using a similar design to the pricier Pixel Buds Pro 2, but with some changes to keep the cost low.</p><p>The leak shows that the proximity sensor will be relocated to a new place, and it looks like the new microphone array also appears redesigned, with the microphones sitting just below the logo. What’s more is that we could also get to see the silicone ear tips on this budget option, as seen in the image below.</p><blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:qicvhaddltmw5jeupfi73dqu/app.bsky.feed.post/3lw2ixm4ogr26" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreif6gyzkz3u4lhddmmpeag5w4sal6fzt7usize6kufrlpmgot7ruae"><p lang="en">Here's your first proper look at the Google Pixel Buds 2a winfuture.de/news,152836....</p>— @rquandt.bsky.social (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qicvhaddltmw5jeupfi73dqu?ref_src=embed">@rquandt.bsky.social.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rquandt.bsky.social/post/3lw2ixm4ogr26">2025-08-20T00:17:47.535Z</a></blockquote><p>As the launch gets closer, the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-2a-design-and-pricing-details-leak"><u> leaks just keep getting better</u></a>. The Pixel Buds 2a will reportedly not support Silent Seal 2.0, but as mentioned before, it might get improved Active Noise Cancelation (ANC). The leak suggests that the earbuds will also skip features such as conversation detection and wireless charging. Battery life is reportedly up to 7 hours and up to 20 hours with the charging case.</p><p>Not all is bad news, though, as Google is said to be bringing Spatial Audio along with head tracking support to these affordable earbuds — something missing from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-series-review">Pixel Buds A</a>.</p><p>In terms of cost, the new "budget" Pixel Buds 2a are rumored to start at €149 (around $174 USD) in Europe. That's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-2a-design-and-pricing-details-leak"><u>pretty noticeable jump of €50 f</u></a>rom the last Pixel Buds. Everyone’s eager to see if that price bump is coming to the U.S. market, but we're totally in the dark about U.S. pricing. However, the bump in pricing could be due to the added Spatial audio and ANC that could show up in these earbuds</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-2a-everything-i-want-to-see"><u>AC’s Contributor and audio enthusiast, Brady Snyder</u></a>, “Google should also improve the on-earbud controls for the Pixel Buds 2a. While I’m not usually a fan of capacitive buttons and gesture-based controls, they’re excellent on the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2. Every tap, swipe, and hold gesture is registered by my Pixel Buds Pro 2, and I don’t have to push super hard on the earbuds to activate them.”</p><p>He also added that the first Pixel Buds A-series lack volume control gestures, forcing users to use their phone or a voice assistant. Google should fix this on the Pixel Buds 2a.</p><p>While the Pixel Buds 2a will see some new upgrades, it is, however, rumored not to get wireless charging capabilities in its accompanying charging case. This means you will need to rely on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1953839487055720951/photo/1"><u>more basic wired USB-C charging</u></a> to power the case and the earbuds themselves. This definitely seems like a downgrade, considering Google could be working on bringing Qi2 to its Pixel 10 lineup with an exclusive range of Pixel Snap chargers.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/WebUzuFReQ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1953839487055720951">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Google already showed off Android 16’s capabilities at Google I/O this year, along with some of Gemini’s most advanced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-releases-gemini-2-5-flash-with-hybrid-reasoning-and-boasts-faster-speeds">2.5 Flash </a>models. But what’s a Made by Google event without the magic of Gemini? <br><br>It is safe to assume that the tech giant might showcase AI capabilities on their new flagship devices or demonstrate how Gemini can interact with the device's camera, sensors, and other hardware features.</p><p>As we get closer to the debut of the Pixel 10 series, let’s talk about the software. Google has a clearly-defined vision in this area, and Pixel phones have the distinction of delivering clean software without any bloatware. The visual design is unique as well, with Google’s Material You aesthetic combining bright color palettes with quirky styling.</p><p>The UI overhaul coming later this year builds on that foundation, and we can’t wait to try it out. What’s particularly striking is the optimization; Google has proven that it can tailor the software to its Tensor hardware, and with the Tensor G5 touting exciting upgrades, the upcoming Pixels should be among the fastest phones around.</p><p>Google also does a great job with AI-assisted utilities. Features like Magic Eraser, Best Take, and Photo Unblur bring meaningful differentiation to Pixel phones, and it will be interesting to see what Google rolls out this year.</p><p>The changes coming to Tensor G5 should include a beefier NPU, and that should allow Google to leverage on-device AI to a greater extent. This is where Google has a distinct advantage thanks to vertical integration between hardware and software. With the phones slated to use Gemini Nano with multimodality, they’ll be able to deliver AI-assisted utilities around audio, text, and imagery.</p><p>Let’s switch gears to audio. Leaks suggest Google will introduce a new model in the A series, likely dubbed the Pixel Buds 2a. Based on leaked renders, the buds will have a similar design as the Pixel Buds Pro 2, and they even include spatial audio.<br><br>They’re touted to get noise isolation as well, and even if it won’t be on the same level as the Buds Pro 2, it’s a welcome addition. With the buds estimated to cost around $99, they sound like a viable budget alternative to the Pro model.</p><p>In addition to Pixel 10 phones, the Pixel Watch 4, and possibly the Pixel Buds 2a, Google is set to introduce charging accessories. The Pixelsnap stand is the one that piqued the most amount of interest thanks to recent leaks, and the Qi 2-based accessory looks quite interesting. What I like more is the 67W charger; while little is known about the accessory, it should have dual charging ports, and that alone makes it highly intriguing.</p><p>Of course, Google also sells its own cases, and we should get a new series to go with the Pixel 10 models. Leaks point to more affordable options this time around, which is always a good thing. Google is likely to continue offering extensive color options, with the cases designed to accentuate the look of the phones. With the Pixel 10 models slated to switch to Qi 2, we’ll have to wait and see if Google is taking the same stance as Samsung where the magnets are built into the case, or if they’re integrated in the phone itself.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You may ask.</p><p>Google dropped two videos teasing its upcoming foldable within the same week. On Aug. 12, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/KFdO0bpe2MQ" target="_blank">posted the first YouTube video</a>, teasing its  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>. The teaser, about 30 seconds long, takes viewers over the phone's design, which is pretty similar to what we got in 2024 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">9 Pro Fold</a>.  The narrator talks about the joy of opening a new phone and then "opening your new phone" because it's a foldable... get it?</p><p>But what we didn't expect to see was Google opening up the Pixel 10 Pro Fold in the first tease itself, basically revealing both panels of the device. The teaser shows off the device's hinge and a clear glimpse of its camera housing on its rear panel. The final glimpse involves the 10 Pro Fold's inner display, which the teaser gives a complete look at.</p><p>And just in two days, Google drops another video, showcasing the Fold again, but this time, hinting at a possible change in branding. As the video ends with the title "Google Pixel Fold," which is the name of the very first model. Now we don't know for certain if this was a slip-up by the company that wasn't spotted during final reviews, or if Google seems to be working on a much easier title for its device.

Phones are one of those things that start to lose value the minute you buy them, but that doesn't mean they don't work as well as a brand-new one will. Everyone likes to save a little money.</p><p>There is one other good reason to look at a certified device - someone who knows how it should work has looked at it in person. We all know sometimes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-fingerprint-problems-continue">phone launches can be a little problematic</a>, and small bugs end up in users' hands. Those bugs usually get fixed right away if they can be.</p><p>Whether a phone was returned because of those bugs or not, whatever "fix" was done should be applied as part of the renewal. Some things, like small scratches, are acceptable, but when things don't work as they should, the phone won't be resold until they do.</p><p>Finally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-where-can-i-recycle-my-phone">saving an electronic device from the landfill</a> and giving it a new life is good for our planet. That's enough reason to search out "used" phones!</p><p>None of this guarantees the value is there, though. And for this deal, it's <em>totally </em>not something you should buy.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XD8Q8qZRWZeUX8keJSEid5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-official-camera-preview.jpg" alt="Official lifestyle images of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XD8Q8qZRWZeUX8keJSEid5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned above, buying a renewed device can be a great idea. Foldables are no different, and there are a few extra reasons why.</p><p><strong>You're probably going to get a new screen protector</strong>. You might think that's not a big deal, but I'm talking about the factory-installed polymer screen protector that should never be removed. Polymer is a fancy word for plastic, and it's soft. It gets microscratches and fingernail dents on it a lot easier than glass would. You can't change it yourself, but Samsung can.</p><p><strong>The display should be inspected and have a full warranty</strong>. Any tiny scratch on a foldable screen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-glass-bend">can be a death sentence</a>, and even with that screen protector, it happens.</p><p><strong>The hinge will have been inspected</strong>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-most-important-feature-of-a-folding-phone-is-durability">hinge is the most important component</a> on a phone that folds, and it has to be perfect; at least be 100% within the design specs. Someone will have looked at this one and made sure.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AwiVnmTitENQN9uLSAKGwd" name="mrmobile-galaxy-fold-damage-3.jpg" alt="A damaged Galaxy Z Fold screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AwiVnmTitENQN9uLSAKGwd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>There are two reasons why I wouldn't recommend this deal to anyone.</p><p><strong>The price is crazy high</strong>. Samsung's asking $1,169 for a used and refreshed phone that's two generations old. Simply put, that's about $400 more than you should <em>ever</em> spend on a Galaxy Z Fold 5 in 2025. If you really want a renewed Fold 5, you can pick up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Z-Fold5-256GB-Unlocked/dp/B0CYR8P77J?th=1" target="_blank">same model at Amazon for $684.</a></p><p>Finally, the Fold 5 is two generations old. That means <strong>the hinge design is older</strong> and not as good as what's offered today. I can't stress how important the hinge on a foldable is. If it's not spot-on, things go bad.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk" name="Court-gavel-lawsuits.jpg" alt="Court Gavel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Don't buy the Fold 5 refurbished from Samsung.

The judge has yet to make a final ruling, but indications are that this isn't the way it will go. We'll have to wait until all the dust settles for the whole answer.</p><p>There are good reasons why we shouldn't want to see Chrome just sold off to the highest bidder. First, who has the capability to maintain it the way it needs and isn't just as bad at Google when it comes to alleged market share abuse? (Hint: nobody.)</p><p>I still believe that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-will-die-if-split-from-google">without Google, Chrome and Android will die</a>. The only reason to invest the time and money into keeping a project like Chrome alive is to make even more money.</p><p>We're talking a massive investment. There are thousands of people actively working on "Chrome" in some capacity. Those paychecks — as well as research and development costs, testing, and numerous smaller ancillary expenses — all add up to the millions. You and I can't afford to buy Chrome, but even if we could, we would never be able to afford keeping it alive.</p><h2 id="everyone-wants-a-slice-of-this-pie-2">Everyone wants a slice of this pie</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb" name="mobile browsers-2.jpg" alt="Mobile web browser apps on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1384" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've heard about potential buyers from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/perplexity-just-made-a-usd34-5-billion-offer-for-chrome">Perplexity</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/yahoo-buying-chrome-isnt-as-crazy-as-it-sounds">Yahoo</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-usd35-billion-bid-for-chrome-tops-perplexity">Search.com</a>. But really, every tech company would love to be the one that controls Chrome, because it holds about 60% of the web browser market. That means six of every 10 people use the Chrome browser.</p><p>Technically, there are several companies that would be great stewards of Chrome. Oracle, Nvidia, ARM, etc., all would be able to devote the resources needed to keep things moving forward.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of these companies or those that have expressed interest should ever be in charge. Neither should Google, for the very same reasons.</p><h2 id="why-this-matters-2">Why this matters</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="vQT3SZsmGNc2Vnnuj4gizh" name="Google-Search-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Google Search on HP Chromebase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQT3SZsmGNc2Vnnuj4gizh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The internet is a mess of websites about anything you can imagine, from online shopping, business listings, social media, and things that aren't safe to talk about. One thing that keeps it usable is Search. Indexing everything the internet has to offer and delivering it in an easy-to-digest way is something everyone depends on.</p><p>That's where a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a> becomes a powerful and profitable tool. You can open your browser and go to www.google.com or www.bing.com and search for something, and it works just fine. Or you can type whatever you're looking for into the address bar of your web browser and get the same results.</p><p><em><strong>Maybe</strong></em> the same results. Your web browser uses a default search engine like Google when you use it this way. Do you see the issue here?</p><p>If I control what search engine users get by default (like Google does with Chrome or Microsoft does with Edge), I now have an advantage. If I'm also a search company (again, like Google), it's a huge and <em>probably</em> unfair advantage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TNn4y4ENeSptPSRPTi9pvi" name="Google-Search-widget-on-homescreen.jpg" alt="Google Search widget on homescreen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TNn4y4ENeSptPSRPTi9pvi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It wouldn't be if there were no manipulation of the results. Ideally, you should be able to do a search on any engine and get the same results in the same order, no matter what engine you use. They all crawl and index the same pages and gather the same information, so the results are what they are unless you get creative.</p><p>Search websites are very creative. Ads, shopping links, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-testing-generative-ai-weather-summaries-for-search">AI summaries</a>, and keyword weighting make all the difference and are why the same search on Google and Bing gives different results in a different layout.</p><p>Of course, the search company gets paid for these types of links. A lot. Their customers expect a good return on the investment, so all kinds of analytics are collected and used to make sure you see the right ads and shopping links in the right places at the right time.</p><p>You know what? That's fine. It drives innovation, which means a better experience for everyone, and the company that does it the best deserves its place in the market.</p><p>The world doesn't work that way, though. A company with the means to manipulate 60% of web search traffic is going to leverage that into money. If you control the browser and the search engine, you're ****ing in high cotton. You can point users towards anything you want. You can't make them click, but you can make sure they can if they want to.</p><h2 id="just-leave-it-to-google-2">Just leave it to Google</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1669px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="TrCsKMSKRKSQRHxfwWkiEj" name="openai-searchgpt-hero-wide.jpg" alt="OpenAI debuts "SearchGPT" prototype." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TrCsKMSKRKSQRHxfwWkiEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1669" height="939" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No company that has any stake in a search engine has any business controlling Chrome. I've said it out loud. Not because I don't want Google or OpenAI to make money, but because there will be abuse of that market share. It's human nature.</p><p>The same goes for any company with the financial means to make "special" deals with a search engine. When Amazon pays for 100 ads to be shown, it should be treated the same as Bob's Pet Store when it pays for 100 ads. Bob doesn't have the same means as Amazon, so you're probably going to see links to buy your fish food from the retail giant and not Bob.</p><p>Just because the problem is obvious doesn't mean the solution is. Every company has an agenda, and the potential to abuse a product with that much leverage. They can tell you they're the good guys, but they'll still try sneaky ways to make a dollar. It's their duty to do it because shareholders demand it.</p><p>Whoever <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">buys Chrome</a> (if Google is even forced to sell it off) won't build some sort of quasi-socialist "for the people" web browser with it. It will be business as usual. I don't have a clue how this should be handled, but I know for certain that most of the company's interested in it have no business with control of Chrome.</p><p>We might as well leave it in Google's hands if we're going to give it to any of the companies that can afford it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead, my excitement lies with the expected introduction of the Tensor G5 with the Pixel 10 series.</p><h2 id="google-s-taking-the-leap-2">Google's taking the leap</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Until now, Google's Tensor chip has been manufactured by Samsung, and while it's been a good run, it hasn't been great. The problem has been that the Tensor processor lags at least a generation or two behind what Qualcomm and MediaTek release. And for the most part, it's been fine, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> was the best iteration yet, but between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> improvements and general Android upgrades, Google needs to turn things up a notch.</p><p>Google reportedly did just that for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> by making the switch from Samsung to TSMC. According to some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/12793905">leaked benchmarks</a>, the Tensor G5, which appears to be built on a 3nm process (the Tensor G4 was a 4nm chip), could be more than 30% faster than its predecessor. Those are the kinds of improvements we were hoping to see last year, but it just wasn't meant to be.</p><p>Admittedly, this doesn't mean that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be able to go toe-to-toe with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>, or even the regular 8 Elite for that matter. But it doesn't need to, at least not yet, because it's also rumored that the G5 is Google's first "fully in-house made processor."</p><p>That's an important point because it's also what Apple and Samsung do with their respective processors, and it just so happens that Google is now relying on the same company that Apple does to produce its processors.</p><h2 id="what-s-it-all-mean-2">What's it all mean?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="oCEmiq7DminLg3B4MNmXGZ" name="terminal-app-pixel-9-pro-fold-android-16-beta-3-1" alt="Terminal app on Pixel 9 Pro Fold running Android 16 Beta 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oCEmiq7DminLg3B4MNmXGZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why does it matter, and what does it mean? Well, nothing really, at least if you're upgrading from the Pixel 9. But as we saw with the addition of the Linux terminal with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 Feature Drop</a>, Google has <em>something</em> planned for the future, and it's probably going to be big. So, having complete control over the design and manufacturing should give Google all of the tools it needs to truly blend the hardware and the software.</p><p>And that's without even talking about what Google might have in store for the future of Gemini. I wouldn't be surprised if we were also introduced to a new Gemini model, with "nano-banana" and references to "GEM_PIX" making the rounds on X (formerly Twitter). So when you consider what Google was able to do with the Tensor G4 for Gemini, having more control from top to bottom, along with better general performance, should mean that the sky is the limit.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nano banana from LM Arena 🍌Feels like an on-device (nano) image generation model to power upcoming Google Pixel 10 devices.

Then Google takes what it's learned from this go 'round, and puts Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple on notice with the Tensor G6.

According to DCS, Samsung has supposedly "registered" the device well ahead of its expected debut date, which could be in January 2026, if history continues to repeat itself. The rumor claims the S26 Pro could feature a 4,300mAh battery capacity, which is apparently "rated" at 4,175mAh.</p><p>Usually, consumers will see the "typical" rating, which, in this case, is 4,300mAh.</p><p>The leaks add that the Galaxy S26 Pro was listed with a 6.2-inch display. The tipster didn't have much more to add based on this rumored Chinese registration. Still, we're pretty far from any eventual launch of even Samsung's teasers. We can take these early specs with a grain of salt for now.</p><h2 id="new-name-but-familiar-specs-2">New Name... but familiar specs?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FpkX9SiA9fV5enS52ZaXu6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Galaxy-S25-displays-01" alt="Comparing the display size on the Samsung Galaxy S25 with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FpkX9SiA9fV5enS52ZaXu6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the end of July, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/rumor-galaxy-s26-edge-s26-pro-battery-specifications-alleged-increases">rumors surfaced</a> about the Galaxy S26 Pro and Samsung's next Edge model. Those rumors claimed that the S26 Pro was discovered with a 4,300mAh battery. Why this is so significant is because of a previous rumor that says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup">Samsung could vastly switch up</a> its S26 series by dropping the S26 and S26 Plus for the S26 Pro and S26 Edge.</p><p>If the S26 Pro is replacing (what would be) the base S26 model, then this rumored battery capacity is slightly higher than the vanilla S25. When it comes to the S26 Edge, those rumors said it could see a 4,200mAh battery. A big jump from its current 3,900mAh. However, this is still under the S25 Plus' 4,900mAh battery.</p><p>Perhaps Samsung could lean on its alleged "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sus-battery-tech-galaxy-s26-rumors">SUS CAN</a>" battery tech that a report said the OEM was considering back in May. This battery tech would lead to "significantly" bigger batteries in the S26 series, while also boosting charging capabilities.

Again, Google is sticking with its promotional tagline: "Ask more of your phone." The teaser runs through its first feature, which seems to touch on the phone's telephoto lens. Google asks, "What if the camera could get super, super, super close" to your subject, while you're undoubtedly pretty far away.</p><p>The teaser doesn't expand on that, but the clip rolls into quite a familiar feature that we've even seen tested during an I/O keynote.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s amazing what you can create when you ask the right questions.

In 2024, after the Made by Google event of that year, the Pixel 9 went live for pre-orders, but not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">before we saw Add Me showcased</a> during the keynote. Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand said it best: Add Me is "AI that people can understand." The Pixel 9 is capable of taking a group photo once, and then allowing the photographer to step in somewhere and snap another.</p><p>It then leverages its AI software to graciously merge those two photos to a point where it looks like <em>someone else </em>took the photo. Like a video game where it's just some camera floating by a string. While this feels like a feature we should've expected on the Pixel 10, it's nice to see Google (sort of) say so.</p><p>Let's also not forget about the foldable, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/key-specs-of-the-upcoming-pixel-10-pro-fold-unveiled">has had some rumors</a> surface quite recently.

One of its major updates is "Guided Learning" for students, which they can use to ask for step-by-step help with Gemini. Students looking to study with a little more depth (and assistance) can provide Gemini with all the details they can before, and let the AI break it down in a more digestible fashion.</p><p>Google states in today's post that Gemini will also create "images, diagrams, videos, and interactive quizzes" to further enhance a student's learning experience.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is highlighting its newest Storybook update for Gemini. Parents can now create illustrated and AI-voiced storybooks for their kids using their own photos, their child's drawings, and more. The company states that parents can tell Gemin to create a specific story based on a photo, and tell the AI their child's age and interests to help create a short storybook they might enjoy.</p><p>This storybook feature is available for users globally on computers and mobile devices.</p><h2 id="from-fun-intuitive-to-new-gemini-intelligence-2">From Fun & Intuitive to new Gemini intelligence</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.25%;"><img id="uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX" name="Gemini-2.5-Pro" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="627" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is an update that concerns Gemini Ultra subscribers this month, and that's the AI's "Deep Thinking" upgrade. As Google states, Deep Thinking enables the AI to understand and provide better answers for users with complex math and coding problems. The company states Deep Thinking upgrades Gemini's "reasoning," likely making the answers it returns more comprehensive.</p><p>A big Gemini update just started rolling out this week, which Google briefly mentions, and that involves "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-app-personal-context-uses-old-chats-future-personalized-answers-update">personal context</a>." Essentially, the personal context feature enables Gemini to remember and callback to previous chats you've had with it. These older chats will help it remember key details about you automatically without you needing to repeat yourself. If you've previously asked Gemini for a recipe, but said you were allergic to a specific seasoning, the next time you look for inspiration, Gemini will (ideally) keep that allergy in mind.</p><p>Of course, the AI can still mess up, so it's always worth keeping an eye out for that. Additionally, "Temporary Chats" arrive, giving users a little more privacy when asking questions that you don't want Gemini to remember. Temporary Chats were announced on August 13, but Google states this will take some time to reach more users, so it might take a few weeks.</p><p>Google first introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-brings-first-of-its-kind-gemini-drops-for-its-ai-updates">Gemini Drops in July</a>, where it creates a complete roundup of the latest updates for the AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication's snapshots allege that the Pixel 10 Pro XL will be the "giant" in this new series, which sounds pretty much like what we got last year. The leak states the 10 Pro XL is listed with a 5,078mAh battery; however, its supposed "energy efficiency" rating is only a "B." The publication adds that the Pixel 10 Pro XL has been estimated to last roughly 48 hours before needing a charge.</p><p>On the other hand, there's the Pixel 10 Pro, which has supposedly received a 4,707mAh battery, estimated to last 51 hours.

The alleged battery for the base model is 135mAh larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.

If you want to listen to music while working out, for instance, or if you need something compact and portable, earbuds are the only thing that do the trick. The problem is that most buds are uncomfortable or they won't stay in place, and you'll never find a pair of earbuds that sound as good as my Sony XM5s. That's where the Pixel Buds Pro 2 come in.</p><p>While they still can't quite meet the sound quality offered by headphones, these versatile earbuds are the only pair that I've worn comfortably for hours on end. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 don't fall out of my ears when I go for a run, the ANC (active noise cancellation) works great, and they connect almost instantaneously to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PH6kd6he4CbSGcuQ9QxMjL" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-8" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PH6kd6he4CbSGcuQ9QxMjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can fine-tune the EQ settings using the companion app, and the 11mm dynamic drivers deliver big, well-rounded sound that belies the buds' small frame. The included charging case could also get you up with 48 hours of battery life on a single charge, which is pretty impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-vs-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro">compared to something like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>.</p><p>Of course, they're not for everyone.

The WH-1000XM6 fold flat <em>and </em>inward to reduce their footprint and make them easier to travel with. The hinge is also more durable this time, and the headband gets a wider profile that helps reduce any feeling of clamping on your head.</p><p>The rest of the design largely follows previous models, including a matte finish and similarly-sized ear cups and replaceable pads with familiar memory foam.</p><p>A brief note about the case. It’s similar to previous ones, except for how the XM6’s fold to lessen the overall footprint. The latch closing them shut feels like an easier method than the all-around zipper, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9PjhDSv3WJNxDwigWCULth" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-ambient-passthrough" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 from the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9PjhDSv3WJNxDwigWCULth.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Internally, Sony jumps from eight microphones in the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">WH-1000XM5</a> to 12 mics in the XM6, spreading them out by laying out eight on the outside of the ear cups and four inside the cups to help capture all the ambient noise and reduce it to mere silence. That’s where the new QN3 processor comes in — the noise-canceling brain that does the legwork behind the scenes.</p><p>On a recent flight, I could barely notice the droning sound of the plane’s engine or hear the person sitting next to me. And rather than pause playback or remove the headphones, I would just put my hand over the right cup to automatically lower the volume and briefly disable ANC to hear an announcement or exchange a few words with someone.</p><p>If I choose to take them off, the wear sensors are as good as ever, immediately pausing playback and resuming instantly once back in place.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZhTvKJkzCQSFcNDNoyn39j" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-ear-cup-fit" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 ear cup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZhTvKJkzCQSFcNDNoyn39j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The one remaining challenge is high-frequency sounds, like sirens, screaming kids, and screeching train tracks. The XM6s do a great job muffling them down to more insignificant levels, though it also depends on how loud your audio volume is. If those sounds remain continuous or repetitive, you’ll find yourself raising the volume to dampen them further, which could be a problem if you go too loud for longer stretches.</p><p>Sony’s Sound Connect app is rife with a variety of cool settings, though I wish it would clean up the interface to lay it all out in a more constructive way. As is, it feels aged, crowded, and lacking intuition, but you’ll need to navigate through it to find important pieces to utilize.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="bY34dijAdo2LhnWrQoe5Zi" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-screenshots-1" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 app equalizer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bY34dijAdo2LhnWrQoe5Zi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most influential and subjective features is Find Your Equalizer, which creates a custom EQ setting based on a series of sound preference tests. This differs from other brands that use onboard mics to measure the shape of your ears and hearing ability in that it leans more toward a sound signature than personal tuning. I recommend going through this process — or at the very least, tinkering with the EQ to see what suits your own taste for tuning.</p><p>It's not that the XM6 don’t sound good out of the box. It’s just that, like a lot of over-ears these days, the flatter EQ may not fully realize its potential. More dynamic bass, mids, or treble would require you to find that balance on your own. It’s certainly there, given Sony’s excellent foundational tuning, so the odds of you coming away with amazing sound quality are quite high.</p><p>A big reason is that the 30mm drivers are so clean. Sony changed the architecture inside without overtly affecting how the sound travels to your ears, helping retain the clear and resonant quality established throughout the 1000XM line.</p><div><blockquote><p>One of the most influential and subjective features is Find Your Equalizer, which creates a custom EQ setting based on a series of sound preference tests.</p></blockquote></div><p>That also explains why all audio passing through the drivers feels consistent, whether it’s 360 Reality spatial audio or hi-res tracks using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC codec</a>. It’s too bad (though hardly surprising) that there’s no aptX HD support to broaden hi-res options, but since LDAC is a Sony codec, the exclusivity is on brand. This still gives Android users a leg up in<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone"> hi-res support</a> compared to iOS users, who can’t access the same quality.</p><p>The clarity extends to phone and video calls, which improve in two distinct ways. Extra mics mean you should come in clearer for those on the other end, while better sound makes them feel clearer to you. Sony pulls this off by way of an AI model that identifies voices and separates them from the surrounding ambient noise. It works in the background, proving to be an integral reason why busy streets and even gusty winds won’t succeed in ruining the conversation.</p><p>For anyone on the go or working in an office, it’s the kind of reliability you want when communication is key.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="5PVGeMoBYQsnmhDVfsLoUh" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-screenshots-2" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 app auto-play settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5PVGeMoBYQsnmhDVfsLoUh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can take all that further through the Scenes feature on the app, an expansion of Auto-play as it was previously known. Within it is Adaptive Sound Control to automatically adjust noise cancellation and ambient sound settings based on your location, and whether you’re walking, running, sitting, commuting, or working out.</p><p>The Auto-play portion starts playback from your preferred service (Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, or Endel) once you put the headphones on. Voice Cue reads out incoming notifications, including messages, which is convenient when you don’t want to pull your phone out. This way, you could verbalize a response through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> while keeping your hands free. It takes a while to figure out how all these things work, but they are worth trying given their uniqueness.</p><p>The onboard controls are a mix of two physical buttons and touch panels on the right ear cup. Both buttons are distinct to ensure you don’t press the wrong one. Press the ANC button to toggle between it and ambient sound, or hold it down to mute during phone calls. You can also set it so that a double or triple-press launches one of the supported music services. Press the power button once, and you’ll hear battery life levels.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oPiYiG9QB69DF3MfPTH9ch" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-buttons" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 ear cup buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oPiYiG9QB69DF3MfPTH9ch.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the touch-enabled controls on the right ear cup let you play/pause with a double-tap on either side. Simply swipe up or down to raise or lower the volume, or forward to skip a track and back to repeat one. You can also swipe forward or back and hold your finger to fast-forward or rewind, or press and hold on the earcup to activate Gemini or whichever voice assistant you use.</p><p>It’s common for touch controls to act finicky, yet these seem almost incapable of doing anything wrong. While you can turn them off entirely, you can’t adjust their sensitivity in case you feel they’re too effective. Nor can you change or reassign them.</p><p>Fortunately, despite all the extras going on here, battery life holds steady, largely managing up to 30 hours with ANC on. You can feel assured they’ll last for a long-haul flight or daily commute, but it’s worth noting that some competitors offer significantly more battery life per charge.</p><p>One thing I do like is that Sony retains the ability to charge and use the headphones at the same time, meaning you could charge them through your laptop while simultaneously listening to music or making a call. In a pinch, Sony claims you can get up to three hours of playback on a quick three-minute charge, which I can confirm is about right.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sony-wh-1000xm6-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Sony WH-1000XM6: What I don't like</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="twMfGW7QpoDqXoAmkcseoh" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-hanging" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 hanging on a chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twMfGW7QpoDqXoAmkcseoh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/everyone-needs-3-pairs-of-wireless-headphones-here-are-my-picks"><strong>Here's why you should own at least 3 pairs of headphones</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained"><strong>Bluetooth audio terms and codecs explained: aptX, LDAC, LC3, and everything else</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Finding fault in these headphones kind of feels like nitpicking, but no product is ever truly perfect, and even the WH-1000XM6 headphones will show a crack or two. I don’t have enough hair on the top of my head for additional padding, so the headband tends to be the one thing I adjust more often because of the thinner foam layer Sony goes with here. Your experience may vary.</p><p>A major disappointment is the lack of USB-C wired playback. I noted earlier that you could charge and listen at the same time, but that doesn’t mean the audio runs through the USB port. You would have to connect via Bluetooth or use the 3.5mm cable instead. That’s a real bummer for anyone wanting to do so on a phone or tablet without a headphone jack, forcing you to use a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter as a workaround.</p><p>If you’re thinking of these as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout headphones</a>, keep in mind there is no IP rating for them. How well they can handle sweat is hard to gauge, and without the protection, you’ve got nothing to mitigate damage in the one-year warranty, so a cautious approach is wise to protect your investment.</p><p>Lastly, while I already touched on this, the app needs some sort of streamlined overhaul. The number of features is too numerous to cover them all in detail, but I can understand how some might view them as confusing while navigating through Sound Connect.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sony-wh-1000xm6-competition"><span>Sony WH-1000XM6: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.82%;"><img id="isvq6hLzEzdGRbydwEiF7M" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-headphones-hero.jpg" alt="Side view of Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones laying flat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/isvq6hLzEzdGRbydwEiF7M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="877" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sony’s flagship over-ears regularly earn their stripes among the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"> best headphones</a> in the industry, and that’s not going to change here.

The color of each container has a slightly different background from the main page, making them more prominent.</p><h2 id="google-contacts-just-got-more-brighter-and-expressive-2">Google Contacts just got more brighter and expressive</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.95%;"><img id="y63J4aiioS3fiRauEtaJbm" name="google-contacts-material-3-expressive" alt="New Material 3 Expressive design in the Google Contacts app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y63J4aiioS3fiRauEtaJbm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3280" height="2360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There aren't major visual changes in the Highlights and Organize tabs — apart from each section and contact using the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> containers — while the "Create contact" page remains untouched. The actual contact info page, however, has some new UI changes.</p><p>The icons for Call, Message, Video, and Email are now larger and pill-shaped, similar to other apps updated with Material 3 Expressive design. The new shape makes them more prominent and easier to tap.</p><p>Other changes include the removal of the "Contact info" label above the phone number, while remaining details on the contact info page are placed in matching containers like the rest of the app.</p><p>If you don't see the new UI yet, it's because it's rolling out with the 4.6.1.x version via the Google Play Store. Updating should bring the refreshed design.</p><h2 id="incoming-call-screen-is-also-getting-a-major-design-upgrade-2">Incoming Call screen is also getting a major design upgrade</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nvaGK8VrxXfjmpK86chK6U" name="google-phone-contacts-calling-card" alt="New calling card screens for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nvaGK8VrxXfjmpK86chK6U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Alongside this redesign, Google is also testing new calling cards for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-apps-simpler-layout-is-now-hitting-more-devices">Phone app</a>. Currently, when you get a phone call, you only see a small profile image of the caller in the middle of the screen (if you've added one) and nothing more. By contrast, iPhones show a full-screen contact image, making calls feel more personal.</p><p>Google appears to be adding a similar option on Android. In another report, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/14/google-phone-calling-card/">9to5Google</a> has detailed that customizable calling cards are rolling out to some Phone beta users.</p><p>Calling cards let users add a full-screen image of the caller. They can also choose from different fonts and colors, making the entire incoming call screen more customizable. Once the update rolls out, the Contacts app will prompt users to create calling cards directly from the contact info page.</p><p>The new calling cards aren't widely available yet, showing up only for some people on the Phone by Google 188 beta app version. There's no official word on when they'll roll out, but with the Pixel 10's release approaching, it could happen sooner rather than later.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This feature is rolling out now for consumers in the U.S., EU, U.K., Canada, and Australia. Ultrahuman states viO is designed for women with "diverse cycle patterns" as most tracking services are only centered around regular 28-day cycles.</p><p>Behind the Cycle & Ovulation Pro feature is Ultrahuman's "15 years of R&D." The press release states the feature utilizes a temperature-sensing algorithm that was originally for viO's OvuSense. This algorithm has reportedly cleared the FDA hurdles for "intervaginal temperature-based ovulation tracking."</p><p>This algorithm will monitor and display changes within a woman's body as time goes on.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">Ultrahuman</a> states women should gain a better understanding of their cycles and ovulation periods as their lives continue to evolve. Cycle & Ovulation Pro is said to collect a woman's "physiological patterns and temperature biomarkers" through the Ring Air. This provides tracking on the Ring Air that is estimated to be 90% or higher in accuracy. Additionally, Cycle & Ovulation Pro will offer fertility planning support for women, guiding them through various cycle types for "accurate ovulation confirmations."</p><h2 id="logging-changes-understanding-patterns-2">Logging changes & Understanding Patterns</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="hHSgzLy3aVvi9qcUsfKQ8U" name="ultrahuman-cycle-and-ovulation-pro-tracking" alt="The Cycle & Ovulation Pro PowerPlug for the Ultrahuman Ring Air lets women understand their cycle via tracking, data, patterns, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHSgzLy3aVvi9qcUsfKQ8U.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="cgr5u2juthXoGgNPTGipvS" name="ultrahuman-cycle-and-ovulation-pro-confirmation" alt="The Cycle & Ovulation Pro PowerPlug is arriving for the Ring Air, giving women better understanding with ovulation confirmations and trends." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cgr5u2juthXoGgNPTGipvS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Cycle Flags are another aspect of this Pro feature. Ultrahuman says Cycle Flags take into account your temperature data to "suggest hidden patterns" to help you understand cycle variability. Certain trends can include "early or late ovulation, short luteal phase, the absence of ovulation," and more. As previously mentioned, the Cycle & Ovulation Pro feature is designed to help all women, even those outside of the "normal" 28-cycle period.</p><p>Ultrahuman says its feature is designed to help women with PCOS or endometriosis.</p><p>Lastly, Cycle & Ovulation Pro contains a logging feature, letting women note their moods, symptoms, and any changes in behavior. These changes could correlate with "cycle phases," per Ultrahuman, and could help women better identify "long-term" wellness trends.</p><p>Cycle & Ovulation Pro is available for users with the Ultrahuman Ring Air in the U.S., EU, U.K., Canada, and Australia for $3.99 per month or $39 per year. The company teases that other regions are to come. More importantly, those using the regular Cycle & Ovulation PowerPlug can still do so without any disruptions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of entering a destination, dates, or other specifics, you could search for "week-long trip this winter to a city with great food, nonstop only" or "10-day ski trip to a world-class resort," and Google Flights will find you the best deals available.</p><p>Google describes talking to Flight Deals "as though you’re talking to a friend."</p><h2 id="flight-deals-lets-you-find-low-fares-with-just-a-few-words-2">Flight Deals lets you find low fares with just a few words</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="zwbiKc2P8ZinT6TanfWUtA" name="google-flights-deals-video" alt="Video showing how Google Flight Deals work" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zwbiKc2P8ZinT6TanfWUtA.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google says Flight Deals will show "best bargains" that match your search and may even highlight destinations you might not have considered before putting in the query.</p><p>The company says this tool is specifically for travelers planning vacations without fixed dates or destinations. If this fits you, Flight Deals will tap into "hundreds of airlines and booking sites" to get you the best options. However, if you already know exactly where or when you want to go, Flight Deals may not be the best tool.</p><p>Flight Deals will be available within <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-flights-booking-insights">Google Flights</a> in beta starting next week for users in the U.S., Canada, and India.

The most recent one comes from WinFuture, which seems to have got a hold of the entire spec sheet of Google's upcoming foldable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>The spec sheet posted by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,152955.html">publication</a> backs all the previous rumors we've heard about the device. To begin with, its display, the foldable is expected to have a larger 6.4-inch external display with a maximum refresh rate of 60 to 100 Hertz and an increased maximum brightness. The resolution of the outer screen is expected to be 2364x1080 pixels, sporting 3000 nits of max brightness.</p><p>As previous leaks have indicated, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to see thinner bezels on the external screen, which gives users a wider screen to play with. This was also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-in-its-first-official-teaser-before-launch">confirmed in Google's teaser</a> that was posted two days ago,  giving viewers a full look at its rear panel and internal display.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="vh9E8eNvK5CNFsGeF5ymUb" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-Fold" alt="A white product render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold leaked by Android Headlines." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vh9E8eNvK5CNFsGeF5ymUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The leak also details the device's internal display, which is said to be identical to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, measuring 8 inches diagonally, but could see increased brightness reaching 3000 nits. Under the hood, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will supposedly sport the new G5 Tensor chipset with a Titan M2 chip for security. As seen in Evan Blass' leak last week, this one all but confirms the fact that the device will show up with a 5015 mAh battery that can last for over 24 hours and up to 72 hours with extreme power saving mode."</p><p>Additionally, the website notes that the Fold will reach 50% in 30 minutes with a 30W USB-C PPS charger. Speaking of charging, chatter on the block is that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first foldable ever to get Qi2 support, with the rumored "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-to-allegedly-get-qi2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories">PixelSnap</a>,"  wireless charging system, which allows charging at 15 W.</p><p>The website states that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will show up with an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, which would be a game-changer if it were true, considering the device would be the first foldable to ever see such durability. This is backed by its aviation-grade aluminum body, ultra-thin internal glass, as well as foldable glass.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1899px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7R8KfaApqBTALp86vsyybE" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-teaser-hero" alt="An image of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold from Google in its rumored Moonstone color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7R8KfaApqBTALp86vsyybE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1899" height="1068" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other known and rumored specs include the device's camera array, which is said to remain the same as its predecessor, with a 48MP main camera, a 10.5MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 10.8MP telephoto zoom lens. The website notes a possible change with the maximum optical magnification, which could be up by a factor of 10. This could give us zoomed-in images with better detail.</p><p>The device is expected to come in three storage options (256GB / 512GB / 1TB) and two colorways: Moonstone and Jade. The leak claims that the device will get 7 years of Android updates, as well as security updates and feature drops. Lastly, the device is said to come with Android 16 out of the box and Gemini's latest capabilities. While the device is all set to launch in a week, you might to be able to get your hands on one until <em><strong>October</strong></em>, as the tech giant has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/report-allege-pixel-10-pro-fold-pixel-watch-4-shipping-delays-issues">reportedly run into "supply chain issues."</a></p><p>While this leak seems extremely comprehensive, it's important to note that some features mentioned in leaks don't make it to the device itself.

Launched earlier this morning (Aug 14), HTC highlights the VIVE Eagle as "AI-driven wearable eyewear." Since this is—let's say—an alternate route from HTC's VR headsets, the company's senior vice president, Chris Huang, said, “VIVE Eagle represents HTC’s newest exploration in the realm of intelligent living and personal wearables."</p><p>The VIVE Eagle touts a "premium design" at a lightweight 49 grams. HTC states users can alter its comfort by adjusting its nosepads and contoured temples for a fit that'll last you all day. Additionally, the post highlights the inclusion of ZEISS sun lenses, which provide UV protection "without compromising optical clarity."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="SBfdrSZmPXNN7nx3hPbEG3" name="htc-vive-eagle-black-frames" alt="The HTC VIVE Eagle smart glasses in a black option." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SBfdrSZmPXNN7nx3hPbEG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HTC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Packed into the VIVE Eagle is voice-activated AI with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google's Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-android-app-launch">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>. HTC states its AI support can help users capture life's moments with a simple phrase: "Hey VIVE, take a photo." The VIVE Eagle will capture your photos using its 12MP ultra-wide camera, thanks to VIVE AI.</p><p>Recording is another capability of the VIVE Eagle. The press release states users can ask their glasses to record a reminder, take notes, and more just by using their voices.</p><h2 id="music-prviacy-2">Music & Prviacy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="TvTivFmGJpUJ8oDgqj6rb7" name="htc-vive-eagle-berry-frames" alt="The HTC VIVE Eagle in its Berry color option on a female model." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TvTivFmGJpUJ8oDgqj6rb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HTC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other than capturing memories, HTC states its newest AI glasses can even carry your favorite tracks for you. The post highlights the VIVE Eagle's open-ear design with "large acoustic drivers and virtual bass" for richer audio. The company also states the glasses' audio capabilities help to minimize sound leakage, meaning you (hopefully) won't disturb others around you. While out, the VIVE Eagle's speakers can deliver your music in full volume; however, you should still have the awareness to understand what's happening around you.</p><p>Speaking of staying a little private, the glasses reportedly sport AES-256 encryption to safeguard your data stored locally within the device.

Unlike Perplexity, which did not disclose its backers — despite being valued at less than half its bid — Search.com confirmed its bid is "backed by JP Morgan."</p><p>Search.com says over 65% of the world's population uses Google Chrome, and embedding AI into the browser must be "equitable" as it could determine how more than 3 billion people access information in the future.</p><p>The company says that if the bid goes through, Search.com - owned Chrome will offer users cash back for using the browser. It also said it would end the "ad-cluttered web experience" and offer publishers revenue sharing, which has been a long-standing issue since the rise of AI tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">Perplexity</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">AI Mode in Google Search</a>.</p><h2 id="search-com-says-it-ll-offer-perks-for-users-and-publishers-2">Search.com says it'll offer perks for users and publishers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KQat5cKuMmdJpcqaeWu75Z" name="chrome-app-icon-android" alt="Google Chrome for Android app icon on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KQat5cKuMmdJpcqaeWu75Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to Perplexity's bid, Google hasn't commented on Search.com's offer yet.

As such, the FDA reportedly told Whoop that it should seek "prompt action" to rectify this issue.</p><p>Bloomberg notes a statement from an FDA spokesperson today (Aug 13), which says the agency "has not authorized BPI for any use, including for the measurement or estimation of a user’s blood pressure."</p><p>On Whoop's side, the company says the FDA has "misinterpreted" its blood pressure estimation tool as a "medical tool." More importantly, Whoop adds that its Blood Pressure Insights feature is labeled as a wellness-focused tool, and that it is not intended to diagnose more severe cardiovascular medical issues. The publication cites a letter written by Whoop to the FDA on August 4, which reads, "We believe it is not within the FDA’s authority to regulate the product. We therefore do not intend to remove the app."</p><p>The post highlights Whoop's intention to meet with the FDA, in hopes of having "a constructive dialogue" with its officials.</p><h2 id="wellness-or-medical-2">Wellness or Medical?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1655px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZAFTQA7WY6FqgkWk998bAA" name="whoop-5-0-mg-official-launch-rendering" alt="A rendering of the Whoop 5.0/MG bands from its May launch in black and white color options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZAFTQA7WY6FqgkWk998bAA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1655" height="931" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Whoop)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To expand on this, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whoop.com/eu/en/thelocker/introducing-whoop-5-0-and-whoop-mg/">Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG</a> launched earlier this year in May. The Whoop MG is the main highlight for this particular topic since it introduced the company's Blood Pressure Insights. Per the company, the BPI feature is designed to provide "daily estimates of systolic and diastolic ranges right from your wrist." Its launch post states these estimations may help users "understand your recovery, sleep, stress, and more."</p><p>While Whoop's fine print states its BPI is "not a medical device," echoing its statement to the FDA, the agency continues to hammer home the fact that the device "does not fall under the general wellness device policy..."</p><p>Bloomberg highlights that the feature is only available for Whoop Life plan members, which costs a whopping $359 per year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

All the secrets Google is likely trying to hold close to its proverbial chest are being pried away and revealed ahead of the announcement, and that includes one big surprise for the company's third-generation foldable: a new hinge.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use.

It's rumored to be a <em>fully dust-resistant</em> hinge, something the industry at large has struggled to figure out. We first saw this leak <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-folds-durability-rating-might-give-you-more-peace-of-mind">appear in late June</a>, noting that the upcoming Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold would be IP68 water and dust-resistant, marking a first for any foldable phone.</p><p>This comes on the heels of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's release, which didn't move the needle for dust resistance at all, packing in the same IP48 rating as the Fold 6. For note, the 4 in the IP48 rating means that the device is dust resistant down to 1mm particles, which is good enough for most things, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/8hgg4YEdPak?si=San_k1f23fA-tNww&t=367">JerryRigEverything's video shows</a> (timestamp 6 minutes).</p><p>But I expected the first fully dust-resistant hinge to come from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Honor Magic V5</a>, or a company like Oppo or Vivo. Definitely <em>not</em> Google, as the company is rarely among the hardware engineering elite. After all, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> unabashedly looked like an iPhone, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> hardly stood out among a crowd of far more unique foldable phones.</p><h2 id="what-s-in-a-foldable-hinge-2">What's in a foldable hinge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UTxyE5ZTurVUCQftEZnUJM" name="foldable-phone-hinges-mr-mobile-youtube" alt="A screenshot showing foldable hinges from Mr Mobile's video "Inside A Folding Phone: The Hinge That Helped Oppo 'Delete The Crease'"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTxyE5ZTurVUCQftEZnUJM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mr Mobile / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nearly every foldable phone on the market uses a different kind of hinge. While all early foldables used gears, most recent foldable phones have switched to a gearless system. While gears make it easy to lock the hinge in place, they also provide a point that allows dust to enter or, at the very least, a point of failure if dust were to ever get inside the hinge.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, Samsung has been using gearless hinges. They're interlocking metal parts that slide together and stay open via cleverly designed angles. You can see them in action in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/1C1XpwR55ZY?si=qFQt9_1j7ep9G253&t=538">JerryRigEverything's Z Fold 4 video</a> (timestamp 9 minutes), and Google has been using gearless hinges in its Pixel Fold phones for the last two years, as well.</p><p>But Pixels aren't historically known for their durability or long-term use. From overheating processors to problems with warranty claims and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-volume-rocker-falling-off">parts falling off</a>, Google doesn't exactly have a great name in this area. Again, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/NJK_sLBJvsw?si=tLlEzVjF7Jx4NZ3g&t=355">JerryRigEverything's Pixel 9 Pro Fold video</a> (timestamp 6 minutes) shows, Google has work to do on durability when compared to the competition.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KcvdL8WdBxXv4PPERmPsXT" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-titanium-hinge" alt="Razr Ultra 2025 titanium hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcvdL8WdBxXv4PPERmPsXT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 with its titanium hinge and visible gears. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, how in the world is it that Google will supposedly be the one with the first <em>dustproof</em> hinge? The "6" in that rumored IP68 rating means the hinge is completely sealed off from dust of any type or size, which means the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's hinge is going to be as airtight as the International Space Station.</p><p>Hyperbole aside, that takes a lot of bespoke engineering hours to accomplish and, again, is something that not even Huawei, Honor, Vivo, Oppo, or Samsung have been able to accomplish with all the money they've dumped into foldable phone R&D over the years. I'm not saying it's out of the realm of possibility at all, but I certainly didn't expect it from Google's Pixel engineering team, which is <em>only</em> on its third generation foldable product.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-10-pro-fold-durability-is-just-part-of-the-picture-2">The Pixel 10 Pro Fold durability is just part of the picture</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But let's be fair to Google, it looks like the Pixel 10 is going to bring Google into an entirely new realm of engineering excellence.

Does it know the "future" because it was programmed to, or is it using a complex neural network to determine a possible future based on all the knowledge it has in its seemingly endless database?</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">AC thVRsday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC" name="ac-thvrsday-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="AC thVRsday logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.</p></div></div><p>But then it dawned on me: I was talking to an <em>actual robot</em>. It didn't matter how it thought; it was all about how realistic it felt and how close this was to the sci-fi movies we've all grown up watching. These robots were seemingly pulled straight out of the Star Wars universe and could not only function within their designed parameters, but could also psychologically process and respond to any question I asked them.</p><p>This was more than just a ChatGPT moment for me. It was a surreal representation of a future I didn't genuinely think I'd ever live to see; yet, before me was a collection of robots, each with its own job and seemingly functional brain.</p><p>The only way this could have felt more realistic to me is if these were <strong>physical</strong> robots in front of me in a cafe, but thankfully, their heavy mechanical bodies were still confined to the boundaries of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> headset. For now, at least. And soon, everyone will be able to check out the full experience in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/stellar-cafe/23951924494476537/">Stellar Cafe</a> when it launches on the Meta Quest platform later this year.</p><h2 id="just-another-day-in-stellar-cafe-2">Just another day in Stellar Cafe</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ti38XOKwXwI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>My demo opened with me sitting in an elevator. As the doors opened to Stellar Cafe, I could see the friendly bartender wave to me in an attempt to usher me into the room. But, like those strange dreams we all sometimes have, none of my appendages (or virtual inputs) seemed to be working.</p><p>So I asked my handy virtual assistant how to get to the bar and, much to my surprise, my assistant <em>warped me</em> <em>to it</em>. Now I know I can move around just by asking, and the future-forward flavor of this demo has only just begun.</p><p>Immediately, James, the bartender, introduces himself and asks me what I want to drink. Having never visited Stellar Cafe before, I thought my safest bet was to order from the menu, so a Meteor Mocha it was. That is, until I read the ingredients on the side of my cup and realized it had oat milk in it.</p><div><blockquote><p>Upon telling James I was allergic to oats, he profusely apologized and whipped up a new Meteor Mocha with synthetic milk instead. None of this was scripted, and it's not something a developer would likely think of to build into a game in the first place. </p></blockquote></div><p>Upon telling James I was allergic to oats, he profusely apologized and whipped up a new Meteor Mocha with <em>synthetic milk </em>instead. None of this was scripted, and it's not something a developer would likely think of to build into a game in the first place. Heck, I've been to more than a few coffee places that didn't even realize someone could be allergic to oat milk, and you'd think they would be the ones on top of that stuff.</p><p>My conversations with the three other robots in the room were similarly impressive. One robot was sitting next to a scenic view of a few planets, and I wondered if it would know more about them. Turns out it did, and not only that, it wasn't just hallucinating answers the entire time. After describing the planet Golga (I think it said Golga) as "a soulless planet filled with corporate resorts and pristine beaches," I asked it which planet it was referring to.</p><p>To my surprise, it not only told me that the purple planet was Golga, but the green planet next to it was "just some backwater mining colony" that seemed to provide all the resources needed for the corporate overlords running the planet next door.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9Sdsta7Ap92jTThCGbqvaS" name="stellar-cafe-official-screenshot-05" alt="An official screenshot of Stellar Cafe on the Meta Quest 3 of a robot writing a letter quitting its job" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Sdsta7Ap92jTThCGbqvaS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Astrobeam)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, all the robots remembered my name as Devin, a misnomer that occurred when I was interviewing Astrobeam's CEO, Devin Reimer, and the game overheard me asking him about something at the bar. Apparently, James asked me my name, and I didn't have the heart to correct him, although it would have been easy enough to do so.</p><p>But Stellar Cafe isn't just some LLM experiment that you'll want to play for 5 minutes and move on to the next thing. Reimer told me the game always takes place in the cafe (hence, the name), but the robots you'll see are always changing. Like a normal cafe, there might be some regulars, but there are plenty of fresh faces (or face screens, as the robots call them) to meet all the time.</p><p>The demo's main objective was to convince all the robots in the room to RSVP for that evening's party. The demo ends once you complete this task, but the full game will venture on to that party and introduce a whole host of new characters and places. Regardless of your location, your goal is to chat with robots and help solve problems through conversation — a core tenet of being human, I'd say.</p><h2 id="a-uniquely-stellar-game-2">A uniquely stellar game</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fYAoWJu4qR4AF5sB45cQfT" name="stellar-cafe-official-screenshot-04" alt="An official screenshot of Stellar Cafe on the Meta Quest 3 of the fortune teller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fYAoWJu4qR4AF5sB45cQfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Astrobeam)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the entire experience, I couldn't get over how profoundly different it was to navigate with my voice. To date, I haven't seen any other games — VR or otherwise — that used voice quite like this. Oftentimes, when you see voice interaction in games, it's just to complete commands.</p><p>In Espire 2, one of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a>, you sneak around like Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid, and can tell guards to "put their hands up," or "freeze," to make them surrender. But these are very specific commands, and you can't just ask your in-game robot companion to go do something for you.</p><p>In Stellar Cafe, that's the whole premise behind the concept, something Reimer says the studio has been working on for the past two years. LLMs like ChatGPT are based on natural language input, and Reimer says the team has constructed a bespoke model that runs efficiently enough to make this a one-time purchase title. Not only that, but it's fast enough to keep responses from making you wait. Ask a robot something, and it replies right away. It's pretty stellar.</p><div><blockquote><p>Each robot's responses are not only quick and impressively natural-feeling, but they run on an efficient custom LLM that will keep this as a one-time purchase game.</p></blockquote></div><p>Not only can you ask your virtual assistant, Visor, to transport you around the room, but you can make these commands with as much or as little knowledge as you might have of the game's content. "Bring me to the window with the orange robot" works just as well as "Sit me at the third seat at the bar with James," or "take me to that fortune teller robot."</p><p>Keeping the conversations compelling and feeling natural relied on an input that <em>felt </em>more natural. When gamers feel bored during a conversation in VR, they often "run around and jump off of stuff," as Reimer noted.</p><p>So if the script is flipped and you can't do that, you'll find yourself fidgeting in your seat, twiddling your thumbs, or picking up objects as you have a conversation, instead. "It's like what you do when normally chatting with people you're seated across from," Reimer added, and I couldn't agree more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U5HfcBqpYRAkxjaPsCZadS" name="stellar-cafe-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of Stellar Cafe on the Meta Quest 3 of the entire cafe and its robot denizens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U5HfcBqpYRAkxjaPsCZadS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Astrobeam)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After spending 30 minutes convincing robots they needed to go to the biggest party of the year, I was convinced that I needed to play the full Stellar Cafe game when it debuted later this year. Reimer's previous chops are rooted in Job Simulator and other Owlchemy Games titles, and it shows in his new company's first release.</p><p>Gone are the days of dialog trees and repeating NPC talk in games. Instead, these characters feel like actual sentient beings in a fantasy world. It's a new era of VR gaming and a unique chapter in the history of the medium, as well, and I can't wait to be a part of it!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The post cites an "industry insider," who stated, "While Samsung is responsible for the hardware portion of its partnership with Google, Google also conducts internal hardware research and prepares for the future, so Samsung must also develop its own brand."</p><p>With Samsung seemingly looking to step away from Google—at least for this supposed device—rumors theorize on its design, which could be "display-less."

In March, a report claimed that Samsung was developing a pair of smart glasses under the project name "HAEAN." These glasses would be a mixed reality pair, something that could go up against the RayBan Meta alternative.</p><p>Project HAEAN is speculated to deliver displays that could showcase "information or images" on its lenses.

According to the Telegram post, the company is seemingly working on a way for users to practice new languages, similar to Duolingo. Mehrad was able to screenshot a "Practice Spanish" menu, which displays the user's goal (how well they want to speak), Daily Activities, and Words Practiced.</p><p>Also, it was nearly cut off, but there's a button that says "create your own practice scenario," which could come in handy if you're trying to gauge your abilities in specific situations.</p><p>On the other hand, the publication, alongside tipster AssembleDebug, dove into the Translate app's code to discover a new graduation cap icon representing "Practice." Google's tagline reads, "practice with AI-powered conversations." The app gives several "recommended" scenarios, encompassing both listening and speaking practices. When listening, users are given an audio clip and asked to tap which words they recognize.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="MoxG7pXc2M6MDAxAZUmny9" name="google-translate-practice-language-leak" alt="A leaked screenshot of Google Translate's supposed "practice" feature to help users learn new languages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MoxG7pXc2M6MDAxAZUmny9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mehrad / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After it's done, and you've seen how well you faired, the Translate app lets users adjust the difficulty of its generated scenarios.</p><p>When creating a pretend custom speaking scenario, the tipster highlights the ability for users to write their own situation or choose a recommended one. From there, users are presented with a selection of "tasks" to complete before getting the chance to speak into the app. There's also a "proficiency" level users can select, which is how well they're able to speak the language they want to learn. The post states there were options present for "Just Starting, Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced."</p><p>The tipster also discovered a quiz function that's created using "rounds." From both Mehrad's screenshot on Telegram and the tipster's APK deep dive, it seems Google Translate's language learning feature is nearly completed. There's no telling when it could arrive officially, but perhaps it's soon.</p><h2 id="breaking-barriers-2">Breaking barriers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="WDFPNnxYttq8c4MaE2kcFP" name="google-pixel-6-pro-translate-03.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro Translate" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WDFPNnxYttq8c4MaE2kcFP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier in June, we heard rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-design-shake-up-rumored-new-upgrades">about a design shakeup for the Google Translate</a> app that could incorporate more features.
