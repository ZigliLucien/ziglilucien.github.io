                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Enjoy our content? Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>I've been using Govee's lighting products for the better part of a half-decade now, and it's safe to say that the brand is my favorite lighting manufacturer. It consistently rolls out interesting products, and tight integration with Google Assistant, Alexa, and Home Assistant make it easier than ever to control its products.</p><p>Govee is having a busy 2025, with the brand introducing a slew of products across new categories. Its latest is the Uplighter Floor Lamp, which delivers vibrant diffused lighting and doubles as a reading lamp. The Uplighter Floor Lamp made its debut in July 2025, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Uplighter-Projector-Bedroom-Standing/dp/B0F3NZ12GL">available on Amazon for $159</a>. You can get it for slightly lesser ($152) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.govee.com/products/govee-uplighter-floor-lamp?variant=44954993131705">if you buy from Govee's website</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="9GBqsusNUGUAYZQmqWAXTG" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9GBqsusNUGUAYZQmqWAXTG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the outset, the Uplighter Floor Lamp looks like any regular lamp. Setting it up takes just over 10 minutes, and it's about as straightforward as it gets. Where it stands out is the three distinct lighting zones; it serves as a diffuse light that projects onto a wall, you can use it as an ambient light, and there's an LED at the bottom that makes it a reading light.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FvyNTS8UZSXKUx546k9k7G" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FvyNTS8UZSXKUx546k9k7G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The overall design is minimalist, and it doesn't stand out much — when it's off. Govee sells the lamp in black, and I would've liked to see it in white. Outside of that, I don't have any issues with the design or build quality. The stand itself is made out of aluminum, and it has a power button and effect switcher that cycles between various lighting modes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KMt3YYkKrrp5X4Qwq9gVDF" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMt3YYkKrrp5X4Qwq9gVDF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The diffuse mode is where the Uplighter Floor Lamp shines, with the lamp delivering dynamic effects. As is the case with all Govee lights, you get plenty of customizability via the mobile app; there's a good selection of scenes available, and you can easily create your own.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="TkJuKhEj7Xe2F6pT2r4yRG" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkJuKhEj7Xe2F6pT2r4yRG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The diffuse light in conjunction with the ambient light turns the Uplighter Floor Lamp into a party lamp, and it's just plain cool. The LEDs do a good job with the diffusion effect, and it's bright enough to use even during the day even though it's best used at night.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x5LPKMCKHJmMeBCiCbj8NG" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x5LPKMCKHJmMeBCiCbj8NG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also used the focused light quite a bit while reading on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/kobo-libra-colour-review">Kobo Libra Colour</a>; it doesn't have RGB lighting, but can switch from 2700K to 6500K color modes, and you can adjust the brightness of the light and set up schedules to trigger it automatically. The focus light goes up to 1000 lumen, and there are absolutely no issues in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="R2uEPLMU4rAsZwAGgbLJ4G" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R2uEPLMU4rAsZwAGgbLJ4G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can do the same with the diffused light as well, or enable music mode wherein the effects change according to music that's being played. The versatility is where the Uplighter Floor Lamp wins out against other floor lamps, and the dome swivels 330 degrees, allowing you to easily change the orientation of the light.</p><p>Like Govee's recent products, you get Matter integration as well, and it's easy to configure the lamp with the smart home interface of your choice. I use Home Assistant alongside Google Assistant, and it was a breeze to control lighting effects and toggle the device's power.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8786JdNzF8MwNGcryc42NG" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8786JdNzF8MwNGcryc42NG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With Govee's DreamView tech, you can easily sync lighting effects across the brand's products, and it has come a long way in the last year. The feature is easy to use, and all you need to do is add the products into a zone.</p><p>The number of scenes available along with the trio of lighting zones make the Uplighter Floor Lamp a good choice if you want a focused light that also does RGB diffused lighting.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a467670b-f00f-46d7-8651-fcf12002035d">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Uplighter-Projector-Bedroom-Standing/dp/B0F3NZ12GL" data-model-name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:99.38%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5JaskTB4fW53Qky4SXrVq.jpg' alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Uplighter Floor Lamp is a diffuse light that doubles as a focused reading light, and the sheer number of features available make it a good choice. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Why? Is it not as safe as they tell us? I'm curious as to why people think this.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p><p>Hi Charles and thanks for asking a great question that also calls me out for things I've mentioned and not properly explained. That's important to do and it helps me remember that I'm not just talking to a room full of techie nerds.</p><p>I can't speak for everyone, but some others and I think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-miss-my-fingerprint-sensor-not-reason-you-might-think" target="_blank">fingerprints aren't the best way </a>to provide credentials because they're not a password—they're your identity. It's also one of those things you can never change if you need to.</p><p>Regarding security, yes, if you try really hard, you can "crack" a biometric sensor like a fingerprint reader. It's extremely complex and riddled with failures before it would ever work, but if something seems important enough, someone will keep trying until they are successful. Think latex, 3D dental printers, and more spy movie style sheniangans.</p><p>Like most things surrounding security, this makes it more than acceptable. For most of us, nobody is ever going to try that hard to get into our stuff, even if they have a perfect copy of our fingerprints. And when they start trying, they have to find a way around Android or iOS blocking them after a bunch of failed attempts. I'm saying <strong>use your fingerprint without any worries</strong> that it gets hacked unless you're the president of a country or a multi-billionaire.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:969px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FjtmFuFKY5NmGTvDNz6ibQ" name="google-account-lock.jpg" alt="A lock in front of an Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FjtmFuFKY5NmGTvDNz6ibQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="969" height="545" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I quickly mentioned that it's not security that makes me think a fingerprint is not the right solution, so let me explain. Note that this doesn't make me right or wrong; it's just a popular idea among people who nerd out trying to break things.</p><p>Your fingerprint is your username. You are Charles, and your fingerprints will always say that you are Charles, like mine always will say I'm Jerry. Using one as a type of passcode, while secure, has a few issues.</p><p>The biggest is that you can never change them. Let's say in 2026 someone finds a way to crack the encryption that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-11s-new-biometric-security-means-all-your-apps-can-work-pixel-4s-face-unlock">keeps biometrics safe</a>. If you have all of your devices and accounts protected by a fingerprint, there is nothing you can do to change it other than stop using your fingerprints and never use them again.</p><p>You will always be Charles, and you will always have Charles' fingerprints. If Joe gets a digital copy of them, they are worthless for protecting anything from Joe. Once Joe can do it, everyone can do it.</p><p>I doubt someone will be able to crack into enough encryption to make fingerprint data something they can use, but anything is possible, and we both know people are trying to do it. People are trying to do everything, it seems.</p><h2 id="a-better-way-2">A better way?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o2in9iK6eDrPYA6kUdTRtN" name="Google-passkey.jpg" alt="Google Passkey on a Windows 11 PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o2in9iK6eDrPYA6kUdTRtN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google and Apple are both working on new ways to secure your devices and accounts. In conjunction with folks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fidoalliance.org/" target="_blank">FIDO Alliance,</a> traditional passwords are becoming things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-problem-with-passkeys">passkeys</a>, and eventually, you might not ever use your fingerprint again.</p><p>I don't like any of the current solutions for one reason: corporate ecosystem lock-in. I do not want to have to rely on Google, Apple, or Microsoft to make the right decisions surrounding my accounts and how I log into them every time. If I commit to Google's emerging passkey system, what if I decide I no longer want to use Google for any of my hardware or software needs? Will I be able to keep my accounts and be able to log into them with Google behind it? Maybe. Maybe it isn't good enough.</p><p>I don't know a better way. Managing secure login procedures is not something people can do themselves, even though they think they are able to. I currently use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Security-Key-NFC-Yubico-authentication/dp/B0BVNRXFHT?tag=georiot-us-default-20&ascsubtag=ac-us-5113532818275763438-20&geniuslink=true&th=1" target="_blank">Yubico security key</a> and have two backups because a small security key is easy to lose. I don't recommend my way to anyone, even though it's easy and secure.</p><p><em><strong>What I do recommend is your fingerprint</strong></em>. Yes, I still think there has to be a better way, but until someone finds it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/how-well-does-the-galaxy-s25-detect-fake-fingerprints-or-facial-data">fingerprints work and are safe to use</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to invites sent out to various tech platforms, Amazon's event is scheduled for September 30 in New York City, a popular destination for tech events this year.</p><p>The invite sent out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778008/amazon-fall-hardware-event-announced-kindles-echo-alexa">The Verge </a>features a blue orb being connected by different Amazon devices, which directly hints at what we could expect coming out of the e-commerce company. The first section of the invite shows a screen with a wave, hints at updates to Amazon's Fire TV device or the Fire tablet.  The top part of the invite features two images that show the blue glow of an Echo smart speaker's LED ring, next to it is Alexa's beaming blue light, both giving away subtle hints that upgrades are on the way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yyBBedkdnqVEh9JT2wZpZA" name="amazon-event2025-invite" alt="Amazon sends out invites for its annual tech event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yyBBedkdnqVEh9JT2wZpZA.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Verge)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And the most prominent and exciting part of the invite is an image that cleverly shows a Kindle with a snippet of text that says, "with the stroke of a pen," which essentially means that Amazon could be bringing handwriting and stylus support, to the next Kindle Scribe, and this new device could feature color e-ink, which would be such a game changer for those yearning to read books and comics in the color that they were published in.</p><p>There is no doubt that Amazon could be focusing on integrating its AI into its hardware ecosystem. Earlier this year, the company gave Alexa a much-needed upgrade by launching the more conversational and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-announces-alexa-plus">intuitive Alexa Plus</a>, which can interact across different streaming, home devices, and shopping apps. While also effortlessly performing tasks like summarizing texts, emails, or complex topics.  And it is but obvious that the new devices will showcase this upgraded version of Alexa, featuring new capabilities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kphcFCckQcAUodiGSHTP75" name="echo-dot-with-clock-4th-gen-1.jpg" alt="Echo Dot With Clock 4th Gen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kphcFCckQcAUodiGSHTP75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There has been recent chatter that Amazon is developing AR smart glasses to compete with Meta and Google. Two people with knowledge of Amazon's AR plans, and who have also worked on the wearable, said that Amazon’s glasses are internally codenamed "Jayhawk." It will have built-in microphones, speakers, a camera, and a full-color display only in one eye. We're hoping Amazon gives us a quick tease of these glasses as well.</p><p>Amazon skipped its big "Devices and Services" last year as it wanted to focus on bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="cnet.com/home/smart-home/amazon-set-to-unveil-upgraded-home-and-entertainment-hardware-later-this-month/">advancements to Alexa</a>.

Officially known as 'Big Deal Days', this members-only sale event usually falls in the second week of October and showcases some of the best tech deals this side of Black Friday.</p><p>Whether you're planning to buy a sweet new Android device or you simply have a question about the upcoming deal event, everything you need to know about October Prime Day can be found in this guide. I've been working sales like this for over a decade and can tell you exactly what to expect when the deals go live. I also have a pretty good idea of which Android devices are likely to be discounted, and which are going to sell out <em>fast. </em>Whatever you're trying to discover this Prime Day, keep scrolling for all of my top tips. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-top-deal-predictions"><span>Top deal predictions</span></h3><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ad824ce2-75d3-4a47-8971-0898fe189ed6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central Review ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2" data-dimension48="Android Central Review ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2" href="https://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Unlocked-Processor-Manufacturer-Whitesilver/dp/B0DP3GP92Z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi" name="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>1.

Amazon has attempted to remedy this issue by slashing up to $250 off the phone at various times over the past few months, which suggests to me that the discount will get even greater during Prime Big Deal Days. If I had to bet, I'd say that the 256GB S25 Ultra will drop to <strong>as low as $949.99</strong> during Amazon's big sale. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Unlocked-Processor-Manufacturer-Whitesilver/dp/B0DP3GP92Z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ad824ce2-75d3-4a47-8971-0898fe189ed6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central Review ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2" data-dimension48="Android Central Review ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="73b4bb83-094c-4a20-9ee0-dd63462e7b4b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central Review" data-dimension48="Android Central Review" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Smartphone-Assistant-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTV1LXZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe" name="Google-Pixel-10-render-Indigo-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>2.

Everything from furniture and clothing to appliances and tech will be going on sale across the two days, plus we'll see loads of lightning deals, celebrity-endorsed live streams, and more. The vast majority of these deals will only be available to Prime members, so now's a good time to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">sign up for Amazon Prime</a> if you haven't already. </p><h2 id="when-is-october-prime-day-2">When is October Prime Day?</h2><p>Although the dates haven't been officially announced, Amazon's Big Deal Days event generally happens during the second week of October. Last year's sale occurred on October 8th and 9th, so I'd expect the 2025 sale to kick off around the same time. </p><p>To speculate further, most Amazon sales over the years have been held on Tuesday and Wednesday, so assuming the retailer sticks with this pattern, we can expect this year's Big Deal Days event to run on October 7th-8th. Needless to say, Amazon should be formally announcing the sale in the next few weeks, so I'll update this guide as soon as we know more. </p><h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-member-to-shop-during-prime-day-2">Do I have to be a member to shop during Prime Day?</h2><p>Yes. Just like the main Prime Day event in July, most of the best deals during Big Deal Days will be exclusive to Amazon Prime members. If you aren't a member just yet, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for a 30-day free trial</strong></a> to enjoy all of the benefits of Prime, or simply wait to see what Amazon's competitors do. Walmart and Best Buy, for instance, are almost certain to launch their own sale events to coincide with October Prime Day, and these probably won't require a membership. </p> ]]></dc:content>

This technology has been around for decades (and was actually first introduced as a concept in science fiction!) but it didn’t reach the mainstream consumer market until somewhat recently, thanks to devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-best-vr-headset-2">What is the best VR headset?</h2><p>The Meta Quest 3 is widely considered the overall <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headset</a>, thanks to its approachable design, excellent performance, and vast library of games. With a starting price of $499.99 for the 512GB headset, the Quest 3 might be a bit too expensive for some folks, which is why Meta has also introduced a more affordable device, the Meta Quest 3S. This $299.99 headset uses a lot of the same technology as its more-expensive sibling while settling for a lower-res display.</p><h2 id="is-vr-for-kids-2">Is VR for kids?</h2><p>VR headsets generally aren’t recommended for kids under the age of 12, largely because these youngsters still have developing eyes and brains. There is also an inherent physical risk to playing VR games, so it’s important that the children are mature enough to understand the dangers of wearing a VR headset. Once they reach an appropriate age, however, many young people have a great time using VR, thanks to the countless kid-friendly games and educational tools that are available.</p><h2 id="what-is-meta-connect-2">What is Meta Connect?</h2><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect</a> is an annual multi-day conference hosted by Meta, one of the leading producers of VR technology. It’s also the company that owns Instagram and Facebook. Every year, Meta uses this event to unveil its latest innovative technology, from VR headsets and smart glasses to advancements in AI and augmented reality (AR).</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company has seemingly changed its profile icon to the suspected upcoming series in preparation for teaser material and its official launch. The device features a rather large external display on its rear panel that fully encompasses its two cameras.</p><p>While it's not completely edge-to-edge, the external display still appears to be a generous size, capable of showing a clock, and likely more from within Xiaomi's mobile OS.</p><p>Leica camera branding is also spotted right under this external display and camera array. The leaked top-half rendering suggests the device's physical buttons (power, volume rocker) will be placed on its right side. Moreover, the phone seems to have rounded corners, flat sides, and potentially a fully flat display. A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/09/xiaomi-17-pro-max-renders-leak-secondary-display.html">Android Headlines</a> chimed in, claiming that this rendering is of the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max.</p><p>Furthering this suspicion is a post on Weibo from the other day by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5211079585568720">the company's head, Lu Weibing</a>. Lu Weibing teased that the upcoming series is reportedly the Xiaomi 17, and will consist of the base 17 model, the Xiaomi 17 Pro, and the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max. The post states the phone will rock the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">recently confirmed</a> Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, the successor to the Elite from 2024, when it launches "this month."</p><h2 id="xiaomi-s-making-moves-2">Xiaomi's making moves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:598px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.33%;"><img id="QGReXn9D9m42js5bV7mZ6F" name="xiaomi-17-series-leaked-external-display-rendering" alt="A leaked rendering of the Xiaomi 17 series' external display, which resembles a large camera visor on its rear panel, with two camera lenses inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QGReXn9D9m42js5bV7mZ6F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="598" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Why Lab / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi's head also teases that the 17 Pro will be a "sophisticated compact imaging flagship," while the 17 Pro Max is designed to be "the more powerful" flagship in the industry.</p><p>Earlier this month, an alleged live photo of Xiaomi's upcoming flagship series was posted online, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomis-next-phone-might-outshine-the-competition-with-a-second-screen-on-the-back">showing off this external display</a>. It was previously assumed that this would end up launching on the Xiaomi 16 series, but it seems things have since changed, and we're hoping up to 17, instead. Either way, an external display on a slab phone is something we haven't seen from Xiaomi since the Mi 11 Ultra days.</p><p>The device is expected to rock a triple camera setup: two lenses within the camera visor-esque external display, and a final lens right under it in a pill-shaped container. Specifications are still up in the air, but if Xiaomi is planning on a launch later in September, we won't have to wait that long.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Plus, MicroLED has improved visibility from wide viewing angles and superior color accuracy.</p><p>If you (understandably) aren't willing to pay $700+ more for MicroLED, the Fenix 8 Pro AMOLED hits 2,000 nits of brightness, double the Fenix 8's brightness, and is much more readable and vivid in outdoor conditions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5373px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LZH984yfMA3tsK5y4epCtf" name="garmin-fenix-8-product-photo-2.jpeg" alt="Photo of the Garmin Fenix 8 main watch face on an athlete's wrist." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LZH984yfMA3tsK5y4epCtf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5373" height="3022" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the design front, the Fenix 8 Pro is much thicker than the Fenix 8 because of its built-in antennas for cellular and satellite connectivity.

And if you jump to the Fenix 8 Pro MicroLED, it's 2.8mm thicker.</p><p>Most Fenix 8s are bulky, and the Pro models are barely any heavier. But even diehard Garmin watch fans who don't mind thick watches might find these chunky Fenix 8 Pros don't work for them. In particular, anyone who liked the Fenix 8 43mm model won't appreciate that size being left off the Pro lineup.</p><p>I've broken down all of the Fenix 8 Pro battery life differences across sizes and display types.

But unless you frequently go on nighttime runs without a phone or on long, solo hiking excursions, you may not really <em>need</em> it.</p><p>Maybe Garmin will eventually make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-should-make-more-pro-watches-like-fenix-8-pro-but-theres-a-challenge">more "Pro" watches with LTE and satellite</a>, in which case you could skip both models; for now, the Fenix 8 Pro is unique to Garmin's lineup, while you can get most of the Fenix 8's features for cheaper with the $750 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a> or $800 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9020c988-a2ef-442f-abe2-f1e1bf233d4f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mmd3NzuKnBtUGNKgxc397n.jpg' alt="Render of the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro AMOLED Sapphire GPS Smartwatch 47mm Titanium"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Standalone watch</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Garmin Fenix 8 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Choose the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro if you're a diehard Garmin fan who's willing to pay top dollar <em>and</em> even more monthly for an InReach LTE and satellite subscription, just to ensure you're always connected if you need help or your family wants to check in.

Both retailers are doubling the storage for free, so instead of 256GB, you'll get the Tab S11 Ultra with 512GB of storage.

The biggest difference comes in the form of the design itself, as the Tab S11 Ultra is lighter than its predecessor, with Samsung managing to shave more than 30 grams off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3X7E9v7hUQbRD9XWS9pihW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3X7E9v7hUQbRD9XWS9pihW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some of that can probably be attributed to another change, as there are no longer dual selfie cameras hidden in a notch on the screen. Instead, Samsung dropped the secondary lens, deciding to go with a single 12MP ultrawide camera. It might not make a difference for some, but it might matter to those who are constantly on video calls and enjoyed having the more flexible camera array.</p><p>Samsung has a knack for removing one feature just to offer a different, yet helpful change. So if you're disappointed with the Tab S11 Ultra only having one selfie camera, you might be happy to know that Samsung upgraded the battery over last year's model. The 11,600mAh battery, paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">Dimensity 9400's</a> expected efficiency gains, and this beast could last for days.</p><p>At the very least, you'll get a free storage upgrade, which alone is saving you more than $100. Seriously, this deal is beyond crazy, and time's running out.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you do happen to recall Dyson's foray into making headphones, it's likely because of the Dyson Zone, a Bizarro-World contraption that combined over-ear headphones with an air-purifying mask during the global pandemic.</p><p>If you tuned out after that, I wouldn't blame you, but you'd be missing out on one of the coolest concepts in consumer audio today: the Dyson OnTrac. Unlike the Zone, the OnTrac are no gimmick. These headphones pair striking looks with solid sound quality and ANC performance. In a crowded market for over-ear headphones, Dyson separated the OnTrac from the rest by leaning into customization as their calling card.</p><p>We first reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/dyson-ontrac-review">Dyson OnTrac</a> in 2024, and in revisiting these headphones one year later, it's clear they still stand out. Considering you can frequently find them on sale — the Dyson OnTrac hit their lowest price ever at $260 on Amazon just last month — they're still a relevant pick for people looking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">great ANC headphones</a>.</p><p>More importantly, I want more audio brands to take note of Dyson's customization offerings, and here's why.</p><h2 id="how-you-can-customize-the-dyson-ontrac-2">How you can customize the Dyson OnTrac</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yZjhi8pP5QWigr9PBhcqkJ" name="Dyson-OnTrac-5" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yZjhi8pP5QWigr9PBhcqkJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many of the best headphones have replaceable ear cushions, and for good reason. If a set of ear cushions gets dirty or damaged, you can replace them for a reasonable cost without having to buy a new set of headphones. This is excellent from a user-repairability standpoint, but the goal here is not necessarily customization. Often, a headphone brand will only sell a color or two of replacement ear cushions, usually matching their basic colorways.</p><p>Dyson takes a different approach, designing the OnTrac ear cushions not just to be user-replaceable, but also to be user-customizable. There are nine different colors of ear cushions you can purchase, far more than the four colorways the Dyson OnTrac are sold in. The idea is that you can buy a pair of OnTrac and then make it your own with customizable cushions, turning Dyson's headset into as much of a fashion accessory as it is an audio product.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oty2krAuTwT8Tv3KjtyhbJ" name="Dyson-OnTrac-4" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oty2krAuTwT8Tv3KjtyhbJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Dyson takes things a step further by letting users replace and customize the outer caps of the headphones, which is basically unheard of in the headphone market. You can twist the outer cap on your OnTrac to unlock it and pull it off the headphones. This will reveal a barebones look at the OnTrac, its shell, and its audio drivers (once the ear cushions are also removed). From there, you can slot in whichever outer cap material and color you'd like.</p><p>There are a total of 10 outer cap colors and finishes, including CNC Aluminum, CNC Copper, Titanium, and Ceramic. The versatility allows you to pick a headphone colorway that matches your style. Perhaps you want titanium headphones to go with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">titanium Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> phone, or you want a pink ceramic pair to go with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">peony Google Pixel 9</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aDDfBCBLVJTaecEyooMrEK" name="Dyson-OnTrac-8" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aDDfBCBLVJTaecEyooMrEK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Between the color of the headband (which you can only choose at purchase), the outer caps, and the ear cushions, there are over 2,000 different combinations of colors you can create with Dyson OnTrac. In a market where far too many of the best headphones are only sold in black or white, this is unparalleled customization.</p><h2 id="a-twist-on-headphone-repairability-and-modularity-2">A twist on headphone repairability and modularity </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wnkgiBWxmBGpRrT7PPEpzJ" name="Dyson-OnTrac-2" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wnkgiBWxmBGpRrT7PPEpzJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, changing out the outer cap or ear cushion on your headphones won't improve sound quality or bring any tangible benefit to the listening experience. Audiophiles, look away. But headphones have become as much of a fashion statement as they are an audio product in recent years.</p><p>If you don't believe me, go to the gym and count how many people you see working out with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/i-pitted-the-airpods-max-against-my-usd3000-audio-setup">AirPods Max</a> — they're probably the worst tool for the job, and yet they're prolific.

Customizing these headphones isn't cheap, with each set of ear cushions or outer caps costing $50 each. Still, it's fantastic to have the option. Even if you wait until your ear cushions are worn out or your outer caps are scuffed up to replace them, it'll still be fun to choose a new colorway a year or two down the line.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hHAyaXgU25Mm9Fn4HA3RyJ" name="Dyson-OnTrac-6" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHAyaXgU25Mm9Fn4HA3RyJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Being able to freshen up a few-year-old pair of headphones with something new might save you from feeling the need to buy a whole new pair, reducing overconsumption and keeping some cash in your pocket.

So, between the iPhone 17 vs. Pixel 10, which is the better fit for you? Let's see how they compare.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10-pricing-colors-and-availability-2">iPhone 17 vs. Google Pixel 10: Pricing, colors, and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B5FTjLbvEhkuo7nVgqkeZ5" name="iphone-17-lineup-pricing-breakdown" alt="Apple's iPhone lineup with pricing following iPhone 17 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5FTjLbvEhkuo7nVgqkeZ5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After months of leaks, Apple officially unveiled the iPhone 17 lineup at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event">"Awe Dropping" event</a> on September 9, 2025. The iPhone 17 starts at the same $799 price as the iPhone 16 base model. This time, however, Apple has bumped the base storage to 256GB, with a 512GB variant also available for $999.</p><p>The iPhone 17 comes in five colors: Lavender (purple), Sage (green), Mist Blue, White, and Black. Pre-orders for the iPhone 17 begin Friday, September 12, with availability in stores starting September 19, 2025.</p><p>Google, on the other hand, took the wraps off the Pixel 10 series about three weeks earlier at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-2025-live-blog-pixel-10-pixel-watch-4-android-16">Made by Google event</a> on August 20, 2025. The baseline Pixel 10 also starts at $799 in the US. However, the base Pixel 10 comes with just 128GB of storage, with only one upgrade option to 256GB — there is no 512GB variant available.</p><p>The Pixel 10 is offered in four colors: Indigo, Frost, Lemongrass, and Obsidian, and is available for purchase immediately through carriers and major retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10-design-and-display-2">iPhone 17 vs. Google Pixel 10: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3MfLMti8entmazo5cVREAe" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-15" alt="Pixel 10 leaning against a pillar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MfLMti8entmazo5cVREAe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At first glance, the iPhone 17 and the Google Pixel 10 adopt a very similar design language. Both are rectangular slab smartphones with a glass-sandwich build, curved corners, and flat-edged frames. But once you turn to the back, the differences appear.</p><p>The iPhone 17 continues with the same vertical camera setup on the top left as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-you-probably-should-not-mind-iphone-16-complaints">iPhone 16</a>, while the Pixel 10 carries its signature horizontal camera visor across the back, housing the camera sensors and temperature sensor. Both devices also feature their company logos centered on the rear.</p><p>In terms of dimensions, the Google Pixel 10 is slightly wider, thicker, and heavier than the iPhone 17. The iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch display and measures 149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm, while the Pixel 10 also has a 6.3-inch display but measures 152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm.</p><p>Another key difference in hand feel is weight. The iPhone 17 is lighter at 177 grams, while the Pixel 10 comes in at 204 grams. The Pixel makes up for it, though, with an extra camera lens and a bigger battery, but more on that later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg" name="iphone-17-colors" alt="iPhone 17 color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of durability, both phones are quite comparable. The Pixel 10 uses Corning’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2, while the iPhone 17 uses Apple’s new Ceramic Shield 2. Both are also IP68 rated, meaning they can handle rain or shallow water immersion for up to 30 minutes.</p><p>One iPhone-exclusive feature that has now made its way to the Pixel 10 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnetic wireless charging</a>. Both the iPhone 17 and Pixel 10 feature magnets on the back, so you can use magnetic chargers, power banks, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> like mounts and wallets without third-party cases or stickers.</p><p>Another iPhone-inspired move, though not necessarily a plus, is the removal of physical SIM trays. Both the iPhone 17 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">Pixel 10 are eSIM-only</a> in the United States, with no SIM card slots available.</p><p>Up front is where the iPhone 17 sees major upgrades. For the first time, the base iPhone gets Apple's ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz, something Android phones, including Pixels, have offered for years. It also features a 6.3-inch Super XDR OLED panel with up to 3,000 nits peak brightness.</p><p>However, one of the big upgrades on the iPhone 17's display this year is the addition of an anti-reflective coating, similar to what we've seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. This should make it easier to view the phone outdoors with less glare.</p><p>The Pixel 10 similarly offers a 6.3-inch OLED display with 120Hz refresh, 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and HDR10+ playback support.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10-hardware-specs-and-software-2">iPhone 17 vs. Google Pixel 10: Hardware, specs, and software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3859px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="D4REekkFrL2YFzA8ppu4vX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Lemongrass-camera-bar-2" alt="Pixel 10 camera bar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D4REekkFrL2YFzA8ppu4vX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3859" height="2171" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple has always led when it comes to smartphone processors, and the company doubles down with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">A19 chipset</a> on the iPhone 17. Similar to the A18 from the previous generation, the A19 is based on a 3nm process, but Apple claims it is now "fast and efficient" and tailored to power on-device AI features.</p><p>And Apple has something to show for it. The company has built what it calls "neural accelerators" into the A19's GPU, which should further improve on-device AI performance, especially with help from the 16-core Neural Engine. In raw performance, Apple claims up to 80% better graphics than the iPhone 15.</p><p>Now, the hardware has always been where Google Pixels lag behind iPhones. While Google has tried to catch up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a> on the Pixel 10, it still falls short.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aHK8zmGZKLcbKh4ns9xDaP" name="apple-a19-chipset" alt="Graphic of the Apple A19 chipset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aHK8zmGZKLcbKh4ns9xDaP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rumors were true: Google switched from Samsung Foundry to TSMC for manufacturing the Tensor G5 on a 3nm process. While this should theoretically improve sustained performance and efficiency, Tensor G5's benchmarks show the Pixel 10 still trails other Android competitors and the iPhone.</p><p>Hardware has never been Google's strong suit, as the company focuses more on user experience and software — and that remains true for the Pixel 10.</p><p>Google hit the numbers it wanted, with the Tensor G5's TPU 60% faster for on-device AI tasks and the CPU 40% faster than the Pixel 9's Tensor G4. Early results also suggest better performance, but if you're buying a device for gaming or video editing, you're probably better off with the iPhone 17.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Apple iPhone 17</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>iOS 26</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch, Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz, 1206 x 2622, Ceramic Shield 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Actua OLED, 120Hz, 1080 x 2424, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Apple A19</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB / 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto (5x) + 13MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>18MP</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, <strong>eSIM only</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, <strong>eSIM only</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Face ID</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,692 mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,970 mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>40W-60W USB-C fast charging</p><p>25W MagSafe Qi2 wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>30W USB-C fast wired charging</p><p>Pixelsnap wireless charging (Qi2, 15W)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions and weight</p></td><td  ><p>149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm; 177g</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm; 204g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Black, White, Mist Blue, Sage, Lavender</p></td><td  ><p>Indigo, Frost, Lemongrass, Obsidian</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Another interesting upgrade on the iPhone 17, something we wish Google had adopted on the Pixel 10 series, is the bump to base storage of 256GB. The iPhone 17 comes in two variants, 256GB and 512GB, while the Pixel 10 only offers 128GB and 256GB. Of course, neither phone includes a microSD slot for storage expansion.</p><p>In terms of battery capacity, the Pixel 10 takes the lead. It ships with a 4,970 mAh cell, while even though Apple increased the size of the iPhone 17, it's still lower at 3,692 mAh. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-charging-speed">The Pixel 10 supports 30W fast charging</a>, while Apple has added dynamic 40W–60W support on the iPhone 17.</p><p>Apple claims the iPhone 17 can charge from 0–50% in about 20 minutes, while the Pixel 10 takes closer to 30. For wireless charging, both phones support Qi2 magnetic wireless charging, but the iPhone 17 offers faster 25W charging compared to the Pixel 10's 15W.</p><p>Of course, actual battery life depends on usage, but so far, I've been pretty impressed with the Pixel 10, while I'm yet to test the iPhone 17.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ywsbeetJV7LuRWPVP2tr3h" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-29" alt="Pixel 10 Magic Cue suggestion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ywsbeetJV7LuRWPVP2tr3h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Turning to software, as we know, the two phones ship with completely different OSes. The Pixel 10 comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> and Google's new bold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a>. The iPhone 17 runs iOS 26 with Apple's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Liquid Glass design language</a>. It's personal preference, but I find Android 16's look more appealing than Liquid Glass.</p><p>As expected, Google leans heavily into AI and software features, and the Pixel 10 is no exception. It includes several new tools you won't find on any other phone, like Camera Coach to guide better photos, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">Magic Cue</a> to surface info when you need it, and features like Daily Hub, Pixel Screenshots, and more. These are some of the features that are not available on the iPhone 17.</p><p>In fact, when it comes to the iPhone 17, Apple strangely didn't even mention Apple Intelligence — its suite of AI features — on stage at the keynote. Apple has clearly fallen behind in AI features and in rolling them out for users.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10-cameras-2">iPhone 17 vs. Google Pixel 10: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f26WpiwBjWToUDa2NTpXjf" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-19" alt="Camera Coach on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f26WpiwBjWToUDa2NTpXjf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, moving on to the cameras, and this is where most people are most interested.

This includes a 48MP primary camera, a 13MP ultra-wide lens, and a 10.8MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. With the company's Pro Res Zoom and Gemini AI, the Pixel 10 can even achieve up to 20x digital zoom.</p><p>This is the first time Google has added a telephoto zoom lens to the baseline Pixel,

But without a telephoto lens, the only optical zoom you get is 2x, achieved by cropping into the main sensor.</p><p>Of course, we can't just compare hardware, but based on hardware alone, the Pixel 10 takes the lead. We're still waiting, though, to see how these cameras compare in real-world use.</p><p>What's upgraded on the iPhone 17 is the main selfie shooter up front. It now features an 18MP front-facing camera with OIS and PDAF. The new addition is that this camera is multi-aspect, meaning it's wide enough that even when holding the phone vertically, you can snap selfies in landscape mode — something Google Pixels don't offer.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10-which-should-you-buy-2">iPhone 17 vs. Google Pixel 10: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3998px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TpcF4QbVJgXA4fbDkbb4Pd" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-hero-1" alt="Holding the Pixel 10 outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TpcF4QbVJgXA4fbDkbb4Pd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3998" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, between the iPhone 17 and the Pixel 10, which one should you buy? As always, comparing the two isn't like comparing <em>apples</em> and oranges. Instead, these phones are designed for different users with different priorities in mind.</p><p>At the top of that list is the OS. Some people prefer Android, while others prefer iOS. And while it will always remain a major differentiating factor when opting for either a Google Pixel or an iPhone, for the first time in years, it feels like buying the baseline entry-level model from both Apple and Google is genuinely worth it.</p><p>Google has upgraded the Pixel 10 to the point where it finally feels like a complete flagship without pushing you to upgrade to the Pro. Additions like Qi2 wireless charging, a much-improved Tensor G5 chipset, a 5x telephoto zoom camera, and plenty of helpful software features make it a phone that won't let you down.</p><p>On the other hand, the iPhone 17 is also a major upgrade with the long-awaited 120Hz refresh rate, faster charging, the powerful Apple A19 chipset, and an improved selfie camera. Altogether, the baseline iPhone now feels far less compromised compared to the Pro models.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="40323473-5a72-4eea-a6f0-1a2c8a010b59">            <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17/" data-model-name="Apple iPhone 17" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUzL8NRPma6QXXkxvxnLYU.jpg' alt="iPhone 17 render"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone 17</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Real upgrade delivered</strong></em></p><p>The Apple iPhone 17 is a big step up from the iPhone 16.

All three phones in the flagship line — which includes the standard Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL — are powered by the new Google Tensor G5 chipset, plus you get an upgraded triple camera system, a bunch of new AI-powered software features, and seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. The Pixel 10 is also the first major Android phone to sport Qi2 MagSafe support.</p><p>There were a few choices that some Android fans may not appreciate, such as removing the physical SIM card tray, but these are pretty minor issues when you look at the overall package here. The big question is if you should upgrade if you're already the proud owner of a Pixel 9. Fortunately, we built a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 10 vs Pixel 9 guide</a> to address this very problem.

The S26 Edge is rumored to jump to 4,200 mAh from 3,900mAh on the Galaxy S25 Edge.

It’s seriously heavy-duty, with a flexible silicone and braided cloth-covered cable that connects the USB-C end to the 3.5mm ported DAC. It’s warm, but with good mid and treble reproduction, and the price is right at just $32.99.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/brady-snyder" target="_blank">Brady Snyder</a> has also been impressed with the FiiO KA11, noting how it's “simply a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle on steroids” and that you'll find that audio coming from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> “immediately sounds better when run through the KA11.”</p><p>For IEMs, Jonnalagadda recommends the Truthear Hexa ($89.99), which sounds great, although some have found the bass to be a bit light. Not a problem that a little EQ can’t fix! They have no inline mic for calls, but they look good, come with memory foam, and have two types of silicone ear tips.</p><p>For headgear, Snyder likes KZ Audio’s KZ ZSN Pro X. He says these $21.59 IEMs cost less than a meal these days and sound superb for the price. “I find the wrap-around cable design paired with the silicone ear tips to be very comfortable, and like that the cord itself is detachable if you need to replace or customize it.”</p><p>Snyder characterizes the sound quality as “firmly good enough” for his casual listening sessions. You can get out the door with both of his recs for under $60! Not bad.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N3etMayJdAu5CH9XMwn9tX" name="sennheiser-660S2-momentum-4-iFi-DACs-group-shot-close-up.jpg" alt="Sennheiser headphones and iFi DACs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N3etMayJdAu5CH9XMwn9tX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">iFi Go Link on the left </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/tshaka-armstrong" target="_blank">my own</a> budget recommendation, I’m going with the iFi Go Link USB-C DAC ($59.99). It has a beautiful alloy body, with a nice braided cable. Its sound signature is pretty neutral, with an enjoyable soundstage, and sparkle in the treble that gives music a live feeling.</p><p>For something to connect to those DACs, I’m going to recommend the Sennheiser CX 300S in-ear headphones with inline calling and playback controls. Since you’re looking at budget earbuds, $38.90 on Amazon for the red version fits the bill!</p><p>Bass is ok, while mids and highs are a bit more forward, giving you solid clarity when it comes to vocals. Between the two, you should get what you need to enjoy lossless for around $100, with tax. If that’s still a bit of a hurdle, you can’t go wrong with FiiO’s KA11 dongle DAC.</p><h2 id="entry-level-upgrades-2">Entry-level upgrades</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QaG7xEfVpfnA7UFQDNGxRJ" name="iem-hero-1.jpg" alt="IEM hero shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaG7xEfVpfnA7UFQDNGxRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Harish gets us started again with his DAC upgrade, the FiiO BTR17 Bluetooth 5.4 USB-C DAC AMP ($220). It supports not only wired connections but LDAC and aptX Lossless. It’s a powerhouse with 3.5mm and the more powerful 4.4mm connections, so it will grow with you, and you get a desktop mode, which helps extend the life of the battery. This is a relatively inexpensive DAC with some flagship features that sounds great!</p><p>For your IEM, he’s recommending the TIN HiFi P1 Max II, which has 14.2mm planar drivers. They come with a 3.5mm cable, no inline microphone</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MjZk27666bq3EbJBENA8NQ" name="tinhifi-p1-max-4.jpg" alt="TinHiFi P1 Max review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MjZk27666bq3EbJBENA8NQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">TIN HiFI P1 Max II </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Brady’s upgrade picks are the venerable Sennheiser HD600 and FiiO KA15. He says the former can reach high volumes when paired with a decent DAC and adapt to a variety of genres, making them versatile entry-level headphones for audiophiles. They have soft ear cushions with an adjustable headband that he calls “perfect for long listening sessions without discomfort.”</p><p>While he hasn't used the KA15, he notes that "it's the natural upgrade from the KA11 that I love. This DAC is a bit bigger, but you get higher balanced output power delivery for higher-impedance headphones, plus support for up to 768kHz/32bit and DSD256 sampling rates — more than enough for Spotify's lossless audio. I also can't help but enjoy the small screen and the shape that makes the KA15 look like a vintage cassette player.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Gz29NLNVAcWqJBSbU6AX25" name="hidisz-mk12-ap80-group-hero.JPG" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris and AP80 PRO-X group shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gz29NLNVAcWqJBSbU6AX25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The upgrade I’m going to recommend is brand new on the market — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hidizs.net/products/hidizs-mk12-turris-12mm-large-91-magnesium-diaphragm-hifi-in-ear-monitors">Hidizs MK12 Turris</a> IEMs (pictured above).

The Go Blu is still one of my favorite DAC/Amps to date. It has an expansive soundstage, bright, crisp highs, and the ability to go from warm to deep, dark, rumbly bass with iFi’s X-Bass feature. It’s a beautifully designed, easily pocketable DAC with exemplary fit and finish.</p><p>Best of all, it can be used as a Bluetooth connection to connect your phone to the IEMs wirelessly, and has a built-in microphone for phone calls!</p><p>There are definitely pricier options out there for you if you want to get the most out of lossless listening. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s3-review" target="_blank">B&W’s top-tier Px7 S3 that I recently reviewed</a> really doesn't require a DAC, since they have a built-in DAC that does a great job with sound reproduction!</p><p>If you really want a DAC, or even a higher-end Android-based MP3 player, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/review-questyle-m18i" target="_blank">Questyle’s M18i</a> is brilliant, and the FiiO M21 digital audio player is the best DAP on the market under $500 right now.

While many wondered it would be called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite 2</a>, since Qualcomm diverged from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 naming with the launch of the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the company has confirmed its next chip will be called Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5.</p><p>While it may look like Qualcomm is changing the naming scheme again, that isn't quite the case. In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2025/09/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-name-power-why">press release</a>, the company explained that while it may look like "we skipped generations," the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 name highlights the fact that this is the fifth generation of its premium 8-series platforms since it adopted the single-digit naming convention back in 2021.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> branding itself is still fairly new. Qualcomm says that the Snapdragon 8 Elite was introduced as a new tier in its flagship portfolio. It was the first processor with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm/qualcomms-elite-branding-should-stay-exclusive-to-oryon-based-chips">Oryon CPU</a> brought to smartphones, delivering "unprecedented performance gains" and hence "debuted as a standalone platform."</p><p>With Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, the company says it wants to simplify how consumers understand its roadmap. The "Gen 5" label is meant to highlight the fifth generation of the 8-series since 2021, while the "Elite" name continues to represent the very highest level of performance available in the Snapdragon family.</p><h2 id="snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-will-be-unveiled-on-september-23-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 will be unveiled on September 23</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mbNG6D48bNwtKdq57ZBaVQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mbNG6D48bNwtKdq57ZBaVQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qualcomm also says Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is "part of a broader roadmap," with more upcoming mobile platforms expected to adopt the Gen 5 naming.

In fact, the Xperia 10 VII's design choice is clearly inspired by Google’s Pixel lineup.</p><p>The Xperia 10 VII delivers the first big design revamp the 10 series has seen in years, even while keeping Sony’s usual bezels and overall layout. The biggest visual change is the camera: instead of the familiar vertical strip, the Xperia 10 VII adopts a pill-shaped horizontal camera bar that instantly makes it look different from its predecessors.</p><p>The phone features a new 1/1.56-inch main sensor alongside a 1/3-inch ultrawide lens, though the MP count is missing from the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.eu/presscentre/sony-reimagines-its-10-series-with-xperia-10-vii" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p><p>Around the front, the 6.1-inch FullHD+ OLED now supports a 120 Hz refresh rate and is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6UzB45fKREKdFdTzDccvPg" name="Sony-Xperia-10-VII-screen-and-rear" alt="Sony Xperia 10 VII screen and rear panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6UzB45fKREKdFdTzDccvPg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="old-school-perks-that-still-matter-2">Old-school perks that still matter</h2><p>The Xperia 10 VII also makes a quiet argument for practicality and keeps hardware perks you rarely see anymore. It packs upgraded stereo speakers up front and a 3.5mm headphone jack. For anyone who wants a phone with real flexibility and full-featured hardware, this one’s hard to ignore.</p><p>Under the hood, Sony has moved to Qualcomm’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-6s-gen-3">Snapdragon 6 Gen 3</a> chip with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, expandable up to 2TB via microSD.</p><p>A 5,000 mAh battery keeps everything running, though charging speeds aren’t aiming to impress. Sony also introduced an “Adaptive Charging” feature meant to keep the battery from wearing out even after four years, but it hasn’t revealed how it actually works.</p><p>The build remains classic Sony, with IP65/68 water and dust resistance and a physical shutter button for quick camera access.</p><p>The Xperia 10 VII comes in at 153 x 72 x 8.3 mm, making it a bit wider and shorter than the last model, and it weighs 169 g.</p><p>On the software side, Sony promises four years of OS updates and six years of security patches, which is a standout commitment in this price range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1140px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="ykNxK3R3FBhpwVFRz3Xrg4" name="Sony-Xperia-10-VII-camera" alt="camera viewfinder of the Xperia 10 VII" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ykNxK3R3FBhpwVFRz3Xrg4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1140" height="855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="mid-range-pricing-limited-availability-2">Mid-range pricing, limited availability</h2><p>Despite the above-mentioned design changes, the phone still clings to noticeable top and bottom bezels, and its availability outside Europe and Asia could be limited.

These chunky frames have been around since last year (I saw someone at Meta Connect 2024 wearing them), but the operating system they ran was pretty early.</p><p>That changes drastically with the latest update, and our sister site, Tom's Guide, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/snap-os-is-finally-ready-for-snap-specs-in-2026-i-just-tested-the-game-changing-update">just got a hands-on with them</a>. In short, these operate similarly to Meta Orion with displays in both lenses, full spatial computing capabilities, and cameras that give you a unique look at the world around.</p><p>Jason England, who is wearing Snap Specs in the photo above, was able to ask the Specs how to do an ollie on the skateboard and was given a visual guide on where to place his feet and what to do with step-by-step instructions. It's an impressive view of how spatial computing can enhance your normal Google search prompts and how having displays on your face can free up your hands to do more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.71%;"><img id="jRV9F8vZn9LhJUjK2Tugod" name="snap-specs-synth-riders" alt="Playing Synth Riders on a pair of Snap Specs smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jRV9F8vZn9LhJUjK2Tugod.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1141" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jason England / Toms Guide)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Staying on the topic of Snap Specs for now, Jason England also got to play popular VR fitness rhythm game Synth Riders on the Snap Specs. It's an impressive showcase of tech power given that VR headsets like the Meta Quest 3 pack a ton of additional processing power inside, yet Snap's smart glasses can run some of the same games.</p><p>Synth Riders can be thought of as a "groovy Beat Saber" where you're essentially dancing with your hands to match lines that appear in your view. It's less slicing and more grooving, which gives the game its unique hook and a big community, plus lots of DLC support.</p><p>Bringing us back to Meta Connect, we're fully expecting to see games make their way to Meta Hypernova smart glasses. One leak is for a game called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1939981903676719501">Hypertrail</a> that reportedly looks like arcade Atari classic Galaga.

The Rugged SSD4 has the same recognizable design as LaCie's other SSDs and HDDs, with a bright orange casing around a silver SSD.</p><p>The key difference is that the drive now comes with a 40Gbps interface, bringing it on par with the best external SSDs. LaCie is positioning the SSD as a universal solution, and it works just as seamlessly on Windows as it does macOS, Android, and iOS. Another standout is that it delivers ProRes video at 4K120 on iPhones, making it the ideal accessory if you shoot a lot of video on your iPhone.</p><h2 id="lacie-rugged-ssd4-pricing-and-availability-2">LaCie Rugged SSD4: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WRFj7ow26c8KVfSqPjrz6G" name="LaCie Rugged SSD4" alt="LaCie Rugged SSD4 4TB SSD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WRFj7ow26c8KVfSqPjrz6G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>LaCie's Rugged SSD4 just made its debut, and it is going on sale over the coming weeks.

The chassis itself is made out of brushed aluminum, and it's clearly built to last. Similar to LaCie's other external drives, the Rugged SSD4 uses 35% recycled materials in its construction.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kcNV4czsJpiYLp9HAoA7aG" name="LaCie Rugged SSD4" alt="LaCie Rugged SSD4 4TB SSD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kcNV4czsJpiYLp9HAoA7aG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The drive gets IP54 dust and water resistance — provided you use the bundled cap to close the USB-C port. It adheres to the MIL-STD-810G standard and can withstand tumbles of three meters without any issues as well as 2,000 pounds of pressure. Basically, you can drive your car over the Rugged SSD4, and it'll come away unscathed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5095px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="F9xdzjeuLRwhcQkmDYGgMG" name="LaCie Rugged SSD4" alt="LaCie Rugged SSD4 4TB SSD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9xdzjeuLRwhcQkmDYGgMG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5095" height="2870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The drive itself is a smidgen bigger than most external SSDs I've used in recent times, and that doesn't hurt its portability in the least. At just 120g, it doesn't weigh much either, and LaCie bundles a USB-C to USB-C cable that can double as a charging cable (up to 240W) and transfers at 40Gbps. My only quibble in this area is that the 0.3m cable is designed to be used with phones and tablets; it wasn't anywhere close to being enough for my gaming machine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8JnfUeovaim23KAicq5FeG" name="LaCie Rugged SSD4" alt="LaCie Rugged SSD4 4TB SSD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8JnfUeovaim23KAicq5FeG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What I like the most about the Rugged SSD4 is the convenience; I used it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, Windows machine, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and it was just as hassle-free.

Before heading to the shelves, you'll want to decide on which colorway you'd like to buy. Much like 2024's Fan Edition Galaxy phone, the S25 FE comes with silver frames and camera lens mounts. This includes each of the colors of the phone. Unlike the S24 FE though, the S25 FE comes in four shades instead of five and has a matte back rather than a glossy one.</p><p>Some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 FE</a> shades look better than the others because of color contrast.

If you have your eyes on the device, it's no wonder you're looking to buy the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE. Let's consider which of the four color options you should buy.</p><p>Among all the colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, the Navy variant is the most iconic of the lot. Samsung has always given us a dark blue option when it comes to FE phones, going as far back as the very first one, which was the Galaxy Note 7 FE. And now, when you think of a Samsung Galaxy model with the Fan Edition moniker, it's impossible not to picture at least one dark blue variant.</p><p>Apart from the legacy, the Galaxy S25 FE in Navy is also the most sensible choice. It looks excellent with the silver frame and camera lens mounts, but more importantly, navy blue does a great job of masking fingerprints and dirt. This is helped by the matte finish of the device. Although the lighter colors look nice and Jetblack is another classic color, I say buy the S25 FE in Navy as it looks less boring, is easier to keep clean, and is an iconic colorway.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The brand's latest product is the ChargePlug, which includes dual USB-C ports alongside a USB-A port, and a universal plug.</p><p>The other side contains a 3-prong plug that's standard across India, and the idea is that you can just plug in any accessories or products that use a different plug without any additional hassle. I have dozens of lighting products, audio devices, and chargers that use the U.S.-style blade plug, and if you're in a similar boat, the ChargePlug makes it easier than ever to slot those devices into the wall outlet.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3hkmrk6r2Y8GVBm3VKXgEY" name="Stuffcool ChargePlug" alt="Stuffcool ChargePlug on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3hkmrk6r2Y8GVBm3VKXgEY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="X35CzChZH9gc3q4kQre7NY" name="Stuffcool ChargePlug" alt="Stuffcool ChargePlug on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X35CzChZH9gc3q4kQre7NY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DC67ueTyxDwUtV7dQv9nPY" name="Stuffcool ChargePlug" alt="Stuffcool ChargePlug on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DC67ueTyxDwUtV7dQv9nPY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The GaN charging is just the icing on the cake. I recently started using a surge protector that has built-in USB ports, and I like how convenient it is to just run ambient lights that need just 5W USB power. The ChargePlug also meets those needs, and each USB-C port goes up to 20W over the USB PD standard, and it doubles as a good option if you've got Samsung phones — I didn't see any issues using it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5129px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5rbF2uUXwUR2bUFYFUt84Y" name="Stuffcool ChargePlug" alt="Stuffcool ChargePlug on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rbF2uUXwUR2bUFYFUt84Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5129" height="2889" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of that, the AC outlet has all the requisite connectors, so if you're using a product with a blade plug design, UK's 3-pron design, or the Euro connector, this accommodates any configuration with ease. The plug handles AC power up to 1500W, and I didn't see any issues connecting a projector (XGIMI's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-horizon-s-max-review">Horizon S Max</a>) to the plug and then the wall outlet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="juZMj697WVFQtkg4kEkhEY" name="Stuffcool ChargePlug" alt="Stuffcool ChargePlug on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/juZMj697WVFQtkg4kEkhEY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5134" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-ChargePlug-Universal-plug-Charger/dp/B0FCSP3NLL">in at just ₹949</a>, it is a good alternative to the slew of random devices on Amazon India, and the inclusion of 20W GaN charging is a definite bonus. It doesn't quite measure up as a global travel plug as it needs to be connected to an Indian wall outlet, but if you're just looking to travel locally within the country, it is a good solution.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As part of the move, Google Preferred Care and Fi Device Protection subscribers are being migrated to Pixel Care Plus.</p><p>Whether you're a new or old subscriber, you may be wondering what exactly you get by paying for Pixel Care Plus, and how it's different from older Google protection plans. This guide will cover everything you need to know, from pricing and availability to benefits and how to cancel.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-pixel-care-plus"><span>What is Pixel Care Plus?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DvQLwi6FGcrwsYGLTuUs6i" name="Pixel-Care-Plus-3" alt="A repair facilitated by Google Pixel Care Plus." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DvQLwi6FGcrwsYGLTuUs6i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pixel Care Plus is a device protection plan for Google hardware products, specifically certain Pixel and Fitbit models. It works like any other insurance plan, providing peace of mind in the event your phone, tablet, or watch needs an expensive repair. Pixel Care Plus covers accidental damage, but also extends the hardware warranty of your device.</p><p>A unique benefit of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-launches-pixel-care-program-free-screen-repairs-pixel-10-and-more">Pixel Care Plus</a> is no-deductible screen and battery repairs. However, all other repairs not covered under the extended warranty or screen and battery inclusions will incur a service fee ranging from $49 to $99, depending on the device model.</p><p>Pixel Care Plus is available as an upfront purchase or as a monthly subscription, and can be cancelled at any time. You can buy it with the purchase of a new Pixel or Fitbit device, or add it within 60 days of your purchase in the Google Store or My Pixel apps.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-devices-are-eligible-for-pixel-care-plus"><span>What devices are eligible for Pixel Care Plus?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BfTF9ZDCe3w4vU2zJiRxoT" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-and-10-pro-with-boxes" alt="A jade Google Pixel 10 Pro and a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with their respective boxes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BfTF9ZDCe3w4vU2zJiRxoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pixel Care Plus is available for a slew of Google hardware products spanning the Pixel and Fitbit lines.

Beyond that, other types of accidental damage require a service fee for replacement, but there are other Pixel Care Plus perks. Namely, there's unlimited damage coverage. Most competing plans, like AppleCare Plus and Samsung Care, only let you claim a certain number of repairs or replacements in a given time period.</p><p>Additionally, the device protection plan offers priority support and next-day shipping for replacements. You can also get your device serviced at a Google Store or a certified repair shop, including Asurion's uBreakiFix locations. Google says there are over 700 authorized repair locations that can service your Pixel or Fitbit device in a pinch with Pixel Care Plus.</p><p>Depending on your device, Pixel Care Plus may come at a higher cost than other device protection plans, but it does come with key perks like free screen and battery replacements. You can add coverage to your eligible Pixel or Fitbit device within 60 days of your purchase, even if it wasn't bought directly from Google, so you have some time to decide whether it's right for you.</p><p>You can cancel Pixel Care Plus at any time by signing into the Google Store with your Google account, opening the Pixel Care Plus account hub, selecting your device, and following the prompts to proceed with the cancellation.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="18f3a6f9-79cf-4ec5-8830-4963bc4f5042">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best Pixel yet</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 series ushered in a ton of improvements, including the Pixel Care Plus protection plan for the first time.

It mitigates some key complaints I had with the first Suunto Race, with absurdly good battery life and a training feature that I wish my Garmin Forerunners had.</p><p>When I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-review">Suunto Race</a> last year, I said it was "near the finish line" as a solid mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a>, but the HR results were mediocre, and the GPS data had odd issues with zig-zagging data that added extra distance to every mile.</p><p>I've taken the Suunto Race 2 out enough to know that its battery life isn't a facade, the accuracy has improved significantly, and the ZoneSense tool fixes a complaint I've had with Garmin's training load data for some time.

It helps runners balance their training, but I find it frustrating how they lump each run's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> into one category.</p><p>For example, if I spend five miles in low aerobic, then two miles at an anaerobic sprint, the overall HR average will categorize it as high aerobic, which isn't accurate.</p><p>I want granular data on how long I've spent in different zones and what that means for my fitness. So I went into the SuuntoPlus app store and downloaded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.suunto.com/pages/suunto-zonesense">ZoneSense</a> to do just that. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this tool needed a chest strap for HRV insights that the Race 2's optical sensor can't deliver.</p><p>I'll test ZoneSense properly for the review once my health is in the clear, but the <em>concept</em> is what I'm looking for, so I know when I typically switch to anaerobic at race pace. Or I can intentionally up my intensity after X minutes of low-aerobic endurance building.</p><p>I do wish ZoneSense didn't <em>need </em>a chest strap, but I find it very cool that Suunto has a SuuntoPlus app store full of unique integrations and alternative training tools like this. It makes the Race 2 feel less insular than other fitness watches.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0f41a97d-6505-40df-94fe-aef1f1458bbb">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RF2V9SJV2tNLCQ6dWWvC2A.png' alt="Render of the Suunto Race 2 running watch"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Never quits</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Suunto Race 2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Suunto Race 2 has a 1.5-inch, 2,000-nit LTPO OLED display, 16-day battery life, 10ATM water resistance, and either a steel or titanium case for rugged durability.

It all started when Nintendo itself took down two of the most popular emulators in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Yuzu and Ryujinx</a>. Since then, there have been quite a few different forks crop up in an effort to fill the void.</p><p>None of those, not even Yuzu or Ryujinx, were ever released onto the Play Store, until now. Eden, a Switch emulator forked from Yuzu, has apparently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.eden.eden_emulator&hl=en_US">been on the Play Store</a> since at least August 19. Somehow, it managed to fly under the radar until the someone over on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1nfam26/eden_now_on_play_store/">r/EmulationOnAndroid subreddit</a> spotted it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3218px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UAVgh2Y4mCmzGoHvwSRXQE" name="eden-emulator-google-play-store-listing" alt="Screenshot of the Eden Emulator Google Play Store listing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UAVgh2Y4mCmzGoHvwSRXQE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3218" height="1810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Play)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly enough, it seems that the most recent update is based on v0.0.3-rc3, which was released on August 20. Just last week, the Eden team released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/tag/v0.0.3">stable build of v0.0.3</a>, but this has yet to make its way to the Play Store.</p><p>As for the listing itself, in order to run Eden on your Android device, it'll need to at least be updated to Android 11, and that's just to even install the emulator. Beyond that, you'll need to provide your own "prod" keys and firmware, in addition to actually having the necessary ROM files to play. That in and of itself is a rabbit hole that we can't really help with.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iuKk9HYGFUJxzWkHBqjUn" name="ayn-odin-3-product-lifestyle-4" alt="AYN Odin 3 product lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iuKk9HYGFUJxzWkHBqjUn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nevertheless, Eden's arrival on the Play Store comes at a rather interesting time. Both AYN and AYANEO have introduced an array of Android-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">handhelds</a>. It started with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-ds-pricing-announced-along-with-a-few-surprises">Pocket DS</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-thor-pre-orders-open-tonight-and-its-much-cheaper-than-i-thought">Thor</a>, swiftly followed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-3-is-the-first-snapdragon-8-elite-handheld-starting-at-just-usd299">Odin 3</a> and KONKR Pocket FIT.</p><p>The Pocket DS and Thor are dual-screen handhelds, aiming to capture the magic that once was the Nintendo DS and 3DS (minus the 3D screen). As for the Odin 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneo-puts-retroid-and-anbernic-on-notice-with-its-upcoming-konkr-pocket-fit">Pocket FIT</a>, these are the first two handhelds to be announced powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JTmjnzutjLWWnACEdZkyzV" name="ayaneo-konkr-pocket-fit-colors-lifestyle-render" alt="AYANEO KONKR Pocket FIT lifestyle render showing three of the four color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JTmjnzutjLWWnACEdZkyzV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If that wasn't exciting enough, both of these upcoming handhelds are the cheapest devices to feature the 8 Elite. Pre-orders for the Odin 3 Base start at $330 and will go up to $360 upon release. Meanwhile, the Pocket FIT comes in at $269 during pre-orders, and will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-fit-premier-hi-performance-android-handheld">priced at $329</a> at launch. The only downside to either of these is that AYN isn't expecting to begin shipping the Odin 3 until November, while the Pocket FIT likely won't arrive until December.</p><p>Even still, it's wild to think that we'll have not one, but two Snapdragon 8 Elite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> before the end of 2025. And provided that the Eden team can manage to avoid the ire of Nintendo, you can just download a Switch emulator right from the Play Store. Although, if last year is anything to go by, I suspect this won't be the case for too much longer.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="808080cd-e3ac-4256-a05b-a293d0ba30f6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AYN Odin 3: From $330 at Indiegogo" data-dimension48="AYN Odin 3: From $330 at Indiegogo" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/odin-3-the-ultimate-6-120hz-oled-gaming-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FoBLWSVAoVvRPbeqax6eVC" name="ayn-odin-3-black-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FoBLWSVAoVvRPbeqax6eVC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>AYN Odin 3: </strong><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/odin-3-the-ultimate-6-120hz-oled-gaming-handheld/" data-dimension112="808080cd-e3ac-4256-a05b-a293d0ba30f6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AYN Odin 3: From $330 at Indiegogo" data-dimension48="AYN Odin 3: From $330 at Indiegogo" data-dimension25=""><strong>From $330 at Indiegogo</strong></a></p><p>The AYN Odin 3 has been two years in the making, as it's the proper successor to the Odin 2 from 2023.

The entire chassis is now one piece, with a single glass insert slotting into the back to facilitate wireless charging.</p><p>This new iPhone 17 Pro Max build is designed to enhance the smartphone's strength and reduce its temperature, addressing a few drawbacks of the prior models' titanium material. It's still IP68-certified, but now features Ceramic Shield 2 glass on the front with an anti-reflective coating. This takes clear inspiration from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which added a game-changing anti-glare screen earlier this year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From a design standpoint, both the iPhone 17 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra have 6.9-inch screens, but the latter has a flatter and thinner body. The Galaxy S25 Ultra measures just 8.2mm thick, while the iPhone is 8.75mm thick. Apple's smartphone is also 15 grams heavier, so in terms of form factor, the Galaxy S25 Ultra may feel better in the hand.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7ureymsVfpyYAWMpfJfrWo" name="top-down-s-pen-settings-multiple-s-pens-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Top-down view of the S Pen settings on the Galaxy S25 Ultra surrounded by different types of S Pens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ureymsVfpyYAWMpfJfrWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both phones have OLED displays with 120Hz LTPO variable refresh rate support. Apple's phone is slightly brighter, with the iPhone 17 Pro Max capable of reaching 3,000 nits peak in outdoor settings. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra tops out at 2,600 nits, which will still be plenty bright.</p><p>Notably, the Galaxy S25 Ultra packs an S Pen inside, and you can use the stylus for quick drawings or note-taking. There are even a few Galaxy AI features that leverage the S Pen for ease of use, like Sketch to Image. Put simply, the iPhone 17 Pro Max has no equivalent, either on the first or third-party market.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-pro-max-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">iPhone 17 Pro Max vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jLq4jqYrHvT5BECMjFwxhm" name="iPhone-17-Pro-2" alt="The iPhone 17 Pro Max in press renders showing the unibody design and camera features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jLq4jqYrHvT5BECMjFwxhm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">Apple A19 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipsets are the two most powerful mobile processors on the market, and they're inside the iPhone 17 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra, respectively. Both phones utilize vapor chambers to cool these blazing-fast chips and feature optimizations that balance performance and efficiency. They each feature 12GB of memory by default, but only the Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 16GB RAM option tied to the 1TB storage configuration.</p><p>While both handsets start with 256GB of storage, the iPhone 17 Pro Max introduces a 2TB storage configuration for the first time. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra can only be equipped with up to 1TB of storage.

Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra only supports Bluetooth 5.4. Samsung has the edge in biometrics, offering an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and facial recognition.</p><p>Battery life and charging are starting to tip in favor of the iPhone for the first time. The iPhone 17 Pro Max has a 5,088mAh battery capacity, slightly higher than the 5,000mAh cell inside the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It can also charge up to 50% in only 20 minutes.

However, the telephoto camera is an upgrade in one way and a downgrade in another. It's a 48MP lens with 4x optical zoom, but that becomes 8x optical-quality zoom with sensor cropping down to 12MP photos. Last year's iPhone 16 Pro Max could do 5x optical zoom, but didn't have the sensor-cropping capabilities of the new higher-megapixel sensor.</p><p>Otherwise, the 48MP primary sensor can shoot 24MP and 12MP photos, with the 48MP ultrawide adding a 120-degree field-of-view to get more in the shot. Apple added a new 18MP front-facing camera sensor to the entire iPhone 17 lineup, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">it's a square sensor rather than a typical 4:3 sensor</a>.

Apple seems to be copying Google's homework a bit, because the new iPhone 17 Pro Max has what it's calling a camera "plateau." It might sound a bit silly, and some think it <em>looks</em> silly, but it's part of an impressive iPhone 17 Pro Max design shift to a unibody construction.</p><p>The iPhone 17 Pro Max is crafted out of one piece of aluminum that holds all the components with a small cutout on the back for a slab of glass. It creates something of a two-tone look for the iPhone — also reminiscent of older Pixels — that makes wireless charging transmission remain possible. The design change improves durability and thermals, as aluminum is better at dissipating heat than titanium, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max has a vapor chamber for the first time.</p><p>It's worth noting that Google has been using polished aluminum for a while on Pixel Pro phones, and had vapor chambers for cooling before Apple.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-12" alt="Holding a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in front of red brick stairs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I tend to be critical of big and heavy phones, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max actually makes the Pixel 10 Pro XL feel small in this regard. Apple's phone is 8.75mm thick (which doesn't even take the camera plateau into account) and weighs 233 grams.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is thinner at 8.5mm and lighter at 232 grams. Those figures don't include the camera bump either, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is still thinner and lighter than the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Maybe that matters to you, maybe it doesn't.</p><p>Both phones have impressive durability features. The iPhone 17 Pro Max and Pixel 10 Pro XL are both IP68-certified against dust and water ingress, and each has durable glass — Ceramic Shield 2 and Gorilla Glass Victus 2, respectively.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FsL3kFtGCYXCS7PahjVswD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-viewfinder-05" alt="Using a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL to take a photo of red flowers up close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FsL3kFtGCYXCS7PahjVswD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 17 Pro Max has a larger display, measuring 6.9 inches.

If you like the Apple ecosystem, go with the iPhone; if you want tons of on-device AI, grab the Pixel. Either way, you're going to end up with an excellent phone that will last you into the next decade.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f551b691-c82b-4c7d-b300-6baa3f43600a">            <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17-pro/" data-model-name="iPhone 17 Pro Max" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egnTiinBmNpHDkPPfnMf5C.jpg' alt="The iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange in a white product render."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone 17 Pro Max</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The one for speed</strong></em></p><p>If you want raw power and excellent industrial design, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is the clear winner.

And while that's great for breaking down messaging walled gardens, there's also the reality that NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content continues to spread, and that isn't ideal for some.</p><p>Thankfully, Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-finally-shields-you-from-surprise-nudes">built in sensitive content warnings</a> for Messages. If you receive, send, or forward images containing nudity (intentionally or not), your Android phone can automatically detect and blur them. If you'd like to enable this feature on your device, or even on your child's phone, there's an easy way to do it and protect yourself from embarrassment while staying safe.</p><h2 id="what-are-sensitive-content-warnings-in-google-messages-and-how-do-they-work-2">What are sensitive content warnings in Google Messages and how do they work?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fyQgKdrsP97Hqn6oF2RoHg" name="Google-Messages-lifestyle-widescreen.jpg" alt="Google Messages RCS Chat features on a Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fyQgKdrsP97Hqn6oF2RoHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite advanced privacy and safety tools in place, the amount of indecent exposure has only increased. What sensitive content warnings in Google Messages do is add an extra layer of safety by blurring images so you don't accidentally open them in public, or so you can better protect your child from harmful content.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/15724426?hl=en">says</a> sensitive content warnings in Messages use the company's SafetyCore system service to classify if an image warrants a safety warning. Importantly, all of the processing happens on-device, and the data never leaves your smartphone.</p><p>So what happens when your phone detects sensitive content? When a user receives a nude image with the feature enabled, tapping it triggers what Google calls "speed bumps" to make sure they know what they’re about to see.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2508px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="qmjZ9Buznno9fFnNqySv5V" name="Google-messages-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Messages on Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qmjZ9Buznno9fFnNqySv5V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2508" height="1411" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, it shows a warning about the image and an option that leads to a page explaining why such images are harmful. Google Messages also presents direct options like blocking the number.</p><p>As a final step, another pop-up asks if you'd still like to open the image.</p><p>The feature also works when sending. If a user with sensitive content warnings enabled tries to send a nude image, they must swipe and tap “yes”, ensuring they’re certain about what they’re sending.</p><p>It's worth noting that the sensitive content warning feature currently applies only to images and does not work with other media types such as videos and GIFs.</p><h2 id="how-to-enable-sensitive-content-warnings-in-google-messages-2">How to enable sensitive content warnings in Google Messages</h2><p>Given the importance of this feature, especially for children, Google enables sensitive content warnings on smartphones based on the user's age. For kids under 13, the feature is automatically enabled and cannot be turned off.</p><p>For teens between 13 and 17, it's also enabled by default but can be disabled in Google Messages settings. For users over 18, the feature is disabled by default. Thankfully, you can easily enable it on your phone. Here's how to enable it on your device:</p><p>1. Open the Google Messages app on your device.</p><p>2. Tap on your <strong>profile icon</strong> at the top right corner.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Messages settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Scroll down and choose <strong>Protection and safety</strong>.</p><p>5. Tap <strong>Manage sensitive content warnings</strong> and toggle it on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4370px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.61%;"><img id="KjD2HFNMGT2mchTJTFHdVc" name="google-messages-sensitive-cw-how-to" alt="Sensitive content warnings in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KjD2HFNMGT2mchTJTFHdVc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4370" height="2430" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Note</strong>: You might be asked to install SafetyCore services on your Android phone before toggling the feature in Step 5. Just tap the Install SafetyCore button, and once installed, you can enable these warnings.</p><h2 id="smarter-protection-built-into-google-messages-2">Smarter protection built into Google Messages</h2><p>Over the last few months, Google has added several security and privacy features to Android, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">anti-theft tools</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-will-soon-watermark-magic-editor-creations-with-synthid">marking AI-made images</a> in Google Photos, but this is simply one of the best features Google has added in a while. It not only protects children using a phone from indecent exposure but also spares adults from potential public embarrassment.</p><p>While Google notes the feature works offline on the device, it does require users to be signed into their Google account, likely for age-based restrictions.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="15de695c-7d61-451d-92fd-9f4cf38ca1c5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6DtJyAZAFDXdrcN8oCA6ib.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Obsidian"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>AI-powered safety</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro is the most complete flagship from the brand in years.

I've never owned an iPhone, and my last experience using one was probably the iPhone 6, but Apple's latest phones are admittedly pretty enticing, even as a long-time Android user.</p><p>Given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-should-release-another-ipod-touch">Apple's unfortunate disinterest in developing another iPod Touch</a>, I've gone back and forth about buying an iPhone, and each year, I feel like the temptation becomes stronger. With the iPhone 17 series, I feel like it's come to a head, and now all that's left is to decide which model would be best for me and look at how they compare to their Android counterparts.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-iphone-17-a-welcome-step-up"><span>The iPhone 17: A welcome step-up</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z" name="iPhone-17-Promo" alt="The entire iPhone 17 lineup against a green background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To me, the base iPhone always felt like the poor man's iPhone, as it made quite a few compromises to keep the price down, especially when you put it next to comparable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. However, Apple seems to have gotten the memo, bringing plenty of notable upgrades that finally make the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17/"><strong>iPhone 17</strong></a> worth looking at.</p><p>For starters, it has a 120Hz OLED display, up from the 60Hz panel on previous models.  It's shocking Apple waited this long to bring it to an $800 phone. It also features a 1-120Hz refresh rate, which surpasses the Pixel 10's 60-120Hz display.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1855px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="cKayuas8XM26sBrJ49TUvQ" name="iPhone-17-cameras" alt="The iPhone 17 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cKayuas8XM26sBrJ49TUvQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1855" height="1043" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Faster charging means it reaches 50% in just 20 minutes, plus Qi2 25W MagSafe charging is something you'll only find on the higher-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>.

The iPhone 17 Pro has a fairly unique look with a bit of glass on the back encased by aluminum.

It's probably the best-looking iPhone I've seen in a long time, sporting a new design that's reminiscent of a Nexus 6P. As Apple's thinnest phone, there's no doubt it's a technological marvel, but there are some compromises to deal with if you're going to pick this $999 phone over competing phones (and even the iPhone 17 Pro).</p><p>Most notably, there's only one camera, which likely takes great photos, but it lacks flexibility. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which is nearly as thin, features a secondary ultrawide camera, which can be handy.

It features the same hardware as last year’s Pixel 9 Pro, but one key addition is the new 100x zoom. Although this is less useful for product photography, I’ve seen improvements across the entire zoom range, which proves far more useful, especially at 2x.</p><p>Like most smartphone cameras, the Pixel 10 Pro uses in-sensor cropping to achieve a 2x ‘optical-quality’ zoom. One thing I’ve found while searching for the best phone camera for work is that 2x, not 1x, is the best mode for shooting product photos. This is largely because the narrower focal length provides a tight crop, but this also offers a shallower depth of field, enabling the product to stand out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="saeDocqSHrFEqkKj6WVmg" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-camera-viewfinder-exposure-app-2" alt="Exposure settings in the Pixel 10 Pro camera app viewfinder" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saeDocqSHrFEqkKj6WVmg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2024" height="1139" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro also has one additional feature that makes it truly fantastic for work photos: RAW photography.

The latter is key, especially when capturing photos in a wide variety of lighting conditions, and Google is the only phone maker to offer easy access to this in the viewfinder.</p><p>I understand white balance and how to effectively deploy it, especially to highlight certain features on a phone, but I usually edit this after capturing the photo. This on-screen toggle allows me to do it while capturing the image, and provides far more creative license to capture unique and visually interesting product photos.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel 10 Pro doesn't have the biggest camera sensor, but it does have the best all-around professional smartphone camera.

The easy explanation is that Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">a free version</a> you can do anything with, and a non-free, but not paid version that has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">some strings attached</a> if you want to use it. But it's a little more nuanced than that.</p><p>Google gets (rightfully) accused of having a heavy hand sometimes, but the actual requirements to use the "official" version of Android are pretty lax. Mostly, you need to make sure that all the apps in Google Play designed for your version of Android work. Yes, I know that's not the case and plenty are broken, but that is what these rules are designed to do.</p><p>Google can fix this pretty easily, but I'll tell you that none of us wants that to happen. Google tries to exercise control over Android, but in reality, it's kind of a free-for-all where companies making products do anything they can to differentiate themselves. Big companies, like Samsung, can do a much better (or worse, depending on your point of view) job of it.</p><h2 id="how-android-became-the-thing-2">How Android became "the" thing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3955px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="UgZSrUeePuYDLmBCNdZVHW" name="Google-logo.jpg" alt="The Google logo on a building" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UgZSrUeePuYDLmBCNdZVHW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3955" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The very reason that this can happen is what made Android what it is in the first place. Letting companies like Samsung or Motorola mostly do their own thing meant they could appease carriers and sell a ton of phones. When you sell a ton of phones, you can make more, and once most phones that are sold use Android, Google is in a unique position.</p><p>This has lessened a bit, and many phones are made without much carrier involvement outside of network compatibility, but you'll still find companies making special phones for carriers. Phone makers no longer need to do it, so they are trying to stand out by being unique. We get things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> as a result, so I'm not complaining.</p><p>That's a good thing, but it can be a terrible thing that leads to brand-new watches not working with brand-new phones and two companies unable to fix it. By unable, I actually mean unable, not unwilling.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tZnWBDJ4tQ2Zc9fwBbpyQM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-8" alt="The main app view on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZnWBDJ4tQ2Zc9fwBbpyQM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google wants your new Pixel 10 to work with your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.

If your phone has to meet certain minimum requirements, you might not be able to sell it at an affordable price. If every phone costs $1,000, a lot of people would stop buying a new one every year.

The company is already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-googles-big-court-win-mean-for-us">considered a monopoly</a> by its home country (agreed), and Google is rightfully under a lot of scrutiny because Android is by far the dominant computing platform in the world. It got there by allowing manufacturers some leeway, so Google shouldn't be allowed to try to walk it back.</p><p>Google tries. Samsung tries. I know that they try, and some of the ideas they come up with to alleviate this situation are remarkable, like the aforementioned Play Services app. Yes, they are a bit demanding and controlling, but they are also a compromise that works.</p><p>Now that we've reached "peak smartphone" and are waiting for another moonshot idea to change everything, this will get worse. Samsung will do more of its own thing, as will Google. Some of those things will be good enough to be integrated into Android, but others will create new problems. There are some very smart folks ready to tackle them, though.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f75324ae-c3b1-4d94-a5ed-2983e7d896ca">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QfdvautZ3KdhiWYonQzJj5.jpg' alt="A render of the graphite Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 40mm smartwatch."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>New look, familiar feel</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Galaxy on your wrist</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 hardware hasn't changed much from the Watch 7, but most of the changes are behind the scenes, such as Gemini smarts, health and nutrition tracking, and One UI 8 Watch.

The company is calling this a "significant" upgrade to its already existing automations experience in the Home app. The post states users will be guided through this new automation update when heading into "New Automation" for the first time.</p><p>Users can now create automations in the following ways: based on presence (whether someone's home or everyone is away), the ability to send notifications to specific people or the whole house, and an option to set automations to run on specified days and times.</p><p>The inclusion of more conditions is something Google highlighted quite heavily, stating they "allow you to create automations that only start when certain criteria are met." Moreover, you can have your device automations react to certain things, like the time of day and whether someone's home.</p><p>Joining this automation update is the ability to create "one-time automations." Users have the choice of forgoing a recurring instance for a chance at letting an automation happen only "this Friday." An auto-delete "after this automation finishes" option enters for a bit of hands-free clean up.</p><h2 id="google-home-continues-to-advance-2">Google Home continues to advance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:279px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:215.05%;"><img id="RfkZkHBDvvTdaj4x9Sf7cP" name="google-home-automations-upgrade-example" alt="An example of the editor users will see when creating new automations in the Google Home app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RfkZkHBDvvTdaj4x9Sf7cP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="279" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This exciting update is starting to appear, but Google says not everything is there.

The post adds that some starters and actions from your Personal Routines will also be unavailable for the time being in the upgraded automations editor.</p><p>This week's update marks quite a significant upgrade for Google Home's automations, something the app focused on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-summaries-test-gemini-automation-details">during its Gemini update</a>. This update brought the company's AI model into the Google Home app for "powerful" automation creation. The AI can suggest helpful automations for your home's devices, as well as hold text-based conversations with you to create routines.</p><p>Google then highlighted the beginning of a limited test with Pixel users for a new "Home Summary" widget. As the name implies, this feature will condense recent occurrences at your home into an organized summary. If something triggered your cameras, you'll see what it was.

While we felt that the list was not as long as it used to be, we were able to round up five obvious features that Apple "took" from Android.</p><p>For starters, Apple basically followed Samsung's suit in launching a slim "iPhone Air," a phone that's just 5.6mm thin. But Samsung beat Apple to the punch earlier this year when it released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which is surprisingly a bit thicker than the iPhone at 5.8mm, but has two cameras.</p><p>The iPhone 17 showed up with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/everyone-is-stealing-the-pixels-best-design-trait-and-im-loving-it">camera bar</a> that has been a staple of Google's Pixel thing, since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>. Third, Apple stuck to its predecessor's pricing, following Google's footsteps with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 lineup.</a> Satellight connectivity is coming to the Watch Ultra 3, which was first brought in by the Fenix 8 Pro, after which Google announced it for the Pixel Watch 4.</p><p>While Apple "stole" some features from Android, it also developed its own unique features, such as the "CenterStage camera," which is quite impressive. This feature utilizes the square camera sensor in a unique way, allowing the camera to crop in to provide portrait or landscape shots without requiring the user to physically rotate their device.</p><p>It also raised the bar to 256GB as a base storage option across the board. Another huge one is BP monitoring on the watch; while this feature is yet to be approved by the FDA, it could be a game-changer for the health industry.</p><h2 id="s-pen-stays-put-on-the-galaxy-s26-ultra-2">S Pen stays put on the Galaxy S26 Ultra</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7ureymsVfpyYAWMpfJfrWo" name="top-down-s-pen-settings-multiple-s-pens-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Top-down view of the S Pen settings on the Galaxy S25 Ultra surrounded by different types of S Pens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ureymsVfpyYAWMpfJfrWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-s-pen-isnt-going-away-at-least-on-the-galaxy-s26-ultra#viafoura-comments"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>It looks like Samsung might keep the S Pen on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, according to a fresh leak. Many S Pen fans have been fearing the worst for the past few months, and for good reason.</p><p>Samsung has been making some moves that the S Pen fans, even though in the minority, have been caught off guard. First, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultras-s-pen-lacking-features-rumor">it removed Bluetooth S Pen features on the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and more recently, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">ditched the S Pen on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, </a>as the Korean OEM wanted to keep things sleek and compact on the phone, which has caused us to think about the future of the S Pen itself.</p><p>While the company continues to make phones lighter and sleeker, we feel that the stylus could be a thing of the past. However, this may not be the case for the next-gen Galaxy S26 Ultra, a new leak from prominent tipster, Ice Universe, hints that the device will indeed keep the S Pen, with alleged device renders showing a dedicated slot for it.</p><h2 id="nothing-ear-3-launches-next-week-2">Nothing Ear 3 launches next week</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nTwNvbdpmU95TpBcBFAcVG" name="nothing-ear-3-first-look" alt="First look at Nothing Ear 3 wireless earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nTwNvbdpmU95TpBcBFAcVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With every product launch, Nothing basically drops a dozen teases, leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination, and it has followed the same pattern with its new earbuds set to launch on Sept. 18.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones">Nothing</a> officially showcased its upcoming wireless earbuds, the Nothing Ear 3, giving us our first look at the design and even a sneak peek at one of the features. The Nothing Ear 3 looks a lot like its predecessors, with a similar design, earbuds with white ear tips, and a transparent-looking stem with silver finishes inside. The case also looks similar to what we have seen before, with a new silver finish for the bottom and a transparent lid, like previous designs.</p><p>However, the company seems to have snuck in a new feature. The "Talk" button is right up front in the earbuds' case. The USB-C port on the right also seems to have a new microphone and/or speaker next to it. It's unclear what the new "Talk" button does, but we expect it to bring up Gemini or its features.</p><h2 id="samsung-could-bring-two-z-folds-next-year-2">Samsung could bring two Z Folds next year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LeupYBjJLH3TukZ3DiV2X5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-Blue-Shadow-5" alt="Blue Shadow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeupYBjJLH3TukZ3DiV2X5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5333" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-two-galaxy-z-folds-in-2026-wide-fold"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">Galaxy Z Fold 7 seems to be a massive hit</a>, according to recent stats, where Samsung is basically scrambling to make more of its ultra-slim foldables.  And now, rumor has it that Samsung has allegedly "shared its development plans" for a second Fold model in 2026, according to an internal source. The publication adds that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8">Galaxy Z Flip 8 </a>will show up with two Z Folds, one being a "Wide" Fold model.</p><p>This Wide-Fold is reportedly aiming to combine dual 18:9 screens "to create an internal display with a nearly identical 18:18 aspect ratio." Basically, the Korean OEM could be going for a tablet-like phone. Furthermore, Samsung is looking to finalize the details about this phone by the end of September or early in October and is "expected to launch simultaneously" with 2026's expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Flip 8 and Fold 8.</a></p><h2 id="pixel-9-makes-google-the-fastest-growing-brand-2">Pixel 9 makes Google the fastest growing brand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-pixel-9-boosts-brand-to-fastest-growing-premium-smartphone-in-2025"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Counterpoint, the research firm, put out some interesting numbers earlier this week, noting that the premium smartphone sales did indeed see an uptick in the first half of 2025. However, Google seems to have stolen the show. The company became the fastest-growing premium smartphone brand, seeing 105% YoY growth. The report suggests that its sales have basically doubled since last year, as more people are opting to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9 series</a>.</p><p>Google has been pushing into new markets and ramping up marketing for the Pixel phones. The company has been emphasizing the unique features of these devices by focusing on their AI capabilities and sleek software, rather than just highlighting specs, which has worked in the tech giant's favor.</p><p>Apple leads the premium market with a 62% share, despite seeing only a 3% YoY growth. While Samsung came second, seeing a 7% growth, thanks to the AI-powered Galaxy S25 series, which seems to have outdone its predecessor (20% market share).</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

The updated screen now offers a swipeable split between your basic music information and your "up next" screen. Starting with the former, the Now Playing screen still displays the album cover in the center with your media controls right under that.</p><p>However, the toggles to switch between audio (the song) and its video are no longer present above the album cover. YouTube Music has also brought its row of elements (like, dislike, comments, add to playlist) down under the media controls. The app removed Lyrics from the bottom, placing them within this repositioned row of options.</p><p>At the very bottom, users will notice a classic floating bar that mirrors what you'd see when using gestures on Android. Pulling up (swiping up) will display the songs YouTube Music plans to play next. The publication notes that users can pull this up part way, which will show four brief songs, or pull it up all the way to see a more extensive list.</p><p>When fully open, this full list makes the Now Playing screen extremely compact, minimizing the cover at the top left with the title, artist, casting icon, and the three-dot menu beside it. This minimized state will also occur when opening your Lyrics and Related options, too.</p><h2 id="youtube-music-brings-people-together-2">YouTube Music brings people together</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="PQps8eK9cL6PEUgvuRgc3J" name="youtube-music-now-playing-dual-pane-redesign" alt="YouTube Music's Now Playing view has been reworked slightly, offering a dual pane view with a repositioned bar of options, for liking, disliking, saving, lyrics, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PQps8eK9cL6PEUgvuRgc3J.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:261px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:229.89%;"><img id="Qmf3smy8KDYdprEy59Xd3J" name="youtube-music-now-playing-up-next-example" alt="YouTube Music's Now Playing features a dual-pane system now, which lets users swipe up from the bottom to view a few "up next" songs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qmf3smy8KDYdprEy59Xd3J.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="261" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The publication reports that this update is slowly rolling out for mobile users (Android, iOS) today (Sep 12).

The celebration was all about how YouTube Music has continued to bring listeners and their favorite artists together on one platform. Not only was it a time to party, but it was also a time for the platform to highlight an update for users. Soon, YouTube Music listeners will get the option to create "taste match playlists."</p><p>These playlists will combine the musical tastes of you and another person to create a unique list of songs that represents you both. Moreover, YouTube Music states it's preparing to introduce live performance and upcoming show alerts for artists. These alerts are said to appear when you're engaging in their content on the platform.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've used dozens of these drives over the course of the last decade, totaling over 120TB of storage. I'm yet to see an issue on any of the drives, and even after 40,000 hours of continuous use, these drives have proven to be reliable.</p><p>IronWolf Pro start at 2TB, and now they go all the way up to 30TB. That's made possible thanks to heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), a technology Seagate pioneered over the last five years. It's exciting to see these drives now becoming available, and I tested the IronWolf Pro 30TB extensively.</p><p>The best part is that these 30TB drives can be slotted into existing NAS systems; Seagate sent over two 30TB drives, and I used them with the UGREEN DXP4800 Plus and DXP8800 Plus. If you've got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">Plex NAS</a> or are setting up a homelab and want a drive that can store just about anything, this is the HDD for you.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-seagate-ironwolf-pro-30tb-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YiYHr49LkrqFyZz4Vw8ziR" name="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB" alt="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YiYHr49LkrqFyZz4Vw8ziR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Seagate unveiled the IronWolf Pro 30TB in July 2025, and the HDD is now available in select global markets, including the U.S. and U.K. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-30TB-Enterprise-Internal-Drive/dp/B0FFC8KWZ8">costs $599 on Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/seagate-ironwolf-pro-sata-st30000nt011-30-tb-3-5-internal-hard-drive/J37C5H5HZQ">Best Buy</a>, which is the same as the Exos M variant of the same drive.

I thought that was plenty of storage at the time, and that machine served me well for several years. I upgraded to a machine with a 250GB hard drive in college, and eventually moved up to 1TB later on.</p><p>To now be able to store 30TB on a single drive is mind-boggling. My storage needs have sky-rocketed in recent years, and I now manage over 380TB across three NAS servers. Even then, I mostly use 18TB and 24TB drives, and it's exciting to see HDD manufacturers push the boundaries of recording technology.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LCPqLhkcXUHJSdXpwY7fdR" name="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB" alt="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LCPqLhkcXUHJSdXpwY7fdR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The IronWolf Pro 30TB uses Seagate's HAMR tech to great effect. While it doesn't have the Mozaic 3+ label on the drive — unlike the 30TB Exos M — it is built on the same platform. The HAMR tech uses a laser to heat up a small portion of a platter to over 450 degrees Celsius (842 degrees Fahrenheit), and the magnetic head writes data into the heated section (which lasts just a nanosecond) at that time.</p><p>The goal with this tech is to maximize areal density, allowing Seagate to introduce platters that hold 3TB of data each. That's how Seagate managed to go up to 30TB on a drive; the IronWolf Pro 30TB has 10 disc platters, each holding 3TB of data. Seagate plans to increase areal density over the coming years, rolling out 32TB and 36TB HDDs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="sBSLCdT3waNAdZCWf6sCaR" name="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB" alt="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sBSLCdT3waNAdZCWf6sCaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/seagate-exos-x24-24tb-hdd-review">24TB Exos and IronWolf Pro drives</a>, the 30TB IronWolf Pro uses CMR tech to actually write the data onto the platter, with HAMR enabling the greater areal density. The IronWolf Pro 30TB HDD also gets the same feature-set that are present in other Seagate NAS drives, including vibration sensors, a 512MB cache, and 550TB/year endurance. The 3.5-inch drive spins at 7200RPM, uses the 6GB/s SATA interface, and has 2.5 million hours MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures).</p><p>Coming to everyday use, the IronWolf Pro 30TB delivers over 265MB/s reads and 270MB/s writes. Reliability is just as great as other IronWolf Pro drives I used in recent years, and I didn't run into any issues in the two months I used the drive. I used it mostly to store data and move 4K video content to and from other NAS servers. Read/write is fast enough that it wasn't an issue while editing videos with the data stored on the NAS.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-seagate-ironwolf-pro-30tb-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB: What I don't like</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Hrmrna499eGL4o9DjW34eR" name="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB" alt="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hrmrna499eGL4o9DjW34eR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There isn't any limitation with the IronWolf Pro 30TBas such, and the only issue as of now is that it costs quite a bit.

While WD and Toshiba also make CMR drives up to 20TB, I prefer IronWolf Pro, so if you don't need 30TB in a single drive, you can get any IronWolf Pro drive in either 28TB, 24TB, 20TB, 16TB, or 12TB configurations.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-seagate-ironwolf-pro-30tb-should-you-buy-it"><span>Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB: Should you buy it?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4DoMyDvt7nQJavvLC9xQ4S" name="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB" alt="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4DoMyDvt7nQJavvLC9xQ4S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You have a homelab and ever-increasing storage needs</li><li>You want cutting-edge HDD tech</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need the best value</li><li>You don't want to store all your data on a single drive</li></ul><p>I get to test the latest tech products — including Huawei's tri-fold Mate XT, a half-dozen foldables just this year, and the latest smart glasses — and it takes a lot to impress me. Seagate's IronWolf Pro 30TB HDD managed to do exactly that; just the fact that we can now store 30TB of data on a single HDD drove home the point of how much technology has evolved.</p><p>My entire storage needs (across eight HDDs) didn't cross 30TB five years ago, and being able to slot in a single drive and have that much storage capacity is outstanding. Outside of that, the IronWolf Pro 30TB is just as reliable as the rest of its siblings; I didn't see any issues moving huge amounts of data to and from the drive, and it doesn't make too much noise.</p><p>Ultimately, if you see yourself needing up to 30TB of storage on a single drive, then you should just buy it. Yes, it costs a lot and isn't really the best value, but the storage potential it offers is unmatched right now.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2ba87657-5823-4fa8-909d-c46a17ccb374">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PwMkhF966pATvTQrRWBgge.jpg' alt="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD listing image"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>If you want to store massive amounts of data on a single drive, it doesn't get much better than the IronWolf Pro 30TB.

Arguably, the second-most striking of them all was the introduction of the iPhone Air, seemingly Apple's response to the Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>I'm not one who really cares, or has ever cared, about really-thin phones, as they're usually accompanied by crappy battery life while missing out on other features. I suspect the same to be true of the iPhone Air, with the iPhone 17 Pro Max being more of my style, especially now that Apple has found a brand new orange ink cartridge.</p><p>But as the Apple event rolled on, it dawned on me that the iPhone Air isn't <em>just</em> a way for Apple to compete with Samsung. It's also serving as a sort of testing ground for what we've been expecting for years: a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16-series-has-me-convinced-apple-needs-a-foldable">foldable iPhone</a>.</p><h2 id="the-writing-is-on-the-wall-2">The writing is on the wall</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.05%;"><img id="8eT8kRg9yL2GzjprPf9j95" name="iphone-air-internals-logic-board-breakdown" alt="iPhone Air logic board and camera see-thru teardown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8eT8kRg9yL2GzjprPf9j95.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1148" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The iPhone Air logic board and camera in a see-through visual. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There was one part of the presentation that tipped me off to this, and it was when the design changes were being explained. In order to make a phone this thin and still give Apple the ability to market it as having "all-day battery," components had to be shifted around. So in order to make this work, Apple shoved all of the major components into the camera "plateau."</p><p>And I'm not exaggerating. The iPhone Air's entire logic board now rests inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/everyone-is-stealing-the-pixels-best-design-trait-and-im-loving-it">camera bar</a>, while still accounting for both the selfie and rear cameras. The rest of the chassis? It's pretty much a large, thin battery and a USB-C port.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QufzJGHEhvERTdej7qdzkR" name="iPhone-Air-4" alt="The iPhone Air in press renders in all colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QufzJGHEhvERTdej7qdzkR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The iPhone Air internals, revealing a large thin battery and the logic board stuffed into the camera bar. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why does that matter? Well, if Apple wants to release a foldable iPhone that isn't immediately laughed out of existence, it needs to be thinner than what previous iPhone models were — especially considering how late Apple is with getting into the game.</p><p>Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-23/apple-aapl-explores-turning-watches-into-wearable-ai-devices-with-cameras-m8ll6mvy">rumors</a> point to Apple's first foldable phone to be a book-style foldable, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, as opposed to a flip phone, like the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr 2025 series</a>. Given Apple's propensity for being a crowd-pleaser, I initially thought the opposite was true —  since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> tend to be more popular due to their nostalgic design and cheaper price tag —  but the iPhone Air pretty much solidifies the book-style rumors.</p><p>In order to release a phone that's thin, sleek, and modern, without making <em>too many</em> sacrifices, Apple had to hit the design reset button. This is likely what spurred the decision to overhaul the iPhone Pro lineup, while also introducing an all-new device. It also doesn't hurt that we were overdue for a proper design change, as the previous iterations were already stale, even with the Titanium frame.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HmPVR9kvVmKqtX9Lj4zTqf" name="iphone-air-fold-mock-render" alt="Mockup of iPhone Fold based on iPhone Air" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmPVR9kvVmKqtX9Lj4zTqf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A mockup of an iPhone Fold based on the iPhone Air design. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With that said, I can't help but feel like the iPhone Air design is a precursor to an eventual foldable. If you tape two iPhone Airs together, side-by-side, that's a pretty good indication of what Apple's first foldable could look like. Of course, that tape will be replaced by some state-of-the-art hinge that "only Apple could make." Or at least that's what we'll be told.</p><p>Even if that isn't the case, there's no denying that seeing Apple being able to redesign basically every element of the phone to fit into a phone this thin is simply extraordinary. The iPhone Air (5.64mm) is thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> (5.8mm), but isn't quite nearly as thin as the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> (5.2mm) or the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (4.2mm). But an iPhone foldable easily could be.</p><h2 id="the-iphone-air-is-a-great-start-to-something-greater-2">The iPhone Air is a great start to something greater</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Cs2uoQHc5TBKFCEmwkmmF8" name="iphone-air-announcement-render" alt="Apple iPhone Air announcement render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cs2uoQHc5TBKFCEmwkmmF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nevertheless, seeing what Apple was able to do with the iPhone Air and how it committed the resources to creating a phone like this to begin with leaves me feeling much better about Apple's first foldable phone.

Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">also point</a> to it being between 4.5mm and 4.8mm thin, meaning that Apple still has a bit of work to do, but the iPhone Air is a good start.</p><p>Android Central contributor and resident thin-phone fanboy, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/brady-snyder" target="_blank">Brady </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/brady-snyder" target="_blank">Snyder</a>, probably summed up the iPhone Air the best way: "The entire body of the iPhone Air is just the battery, and the camera bump actually houses the entire logic board.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'm a diligent note-taker; I jot down thoughts on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/remarkable-2-review">reMarkable 2</a> and use a physical notebook (from Leuchtturm1917) along with a Lamy Safari to journal. I like the convenience and ease-of-use of the reMarkable 2, and it is ideal to take notes while attending briefings and organizing my to-do lists.</p><p>In the last month, though, I've been using a new product: the Flowtica Scribe. It is a regular pen that has a built-in mic that lets records meetings and conversations, and connects to a mobile app to automatically transcribe those recordings and generate summaries. I have Teenage Engineering's TP–7 on hand and used that in the past, but the Flowtica Scribe pulls double duty on account of it being a standard pen you can take notes with. Flowtica is crowdsourcing the Scribe, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flowtica/flowtica-scribe-ai-pen-records-and-understands-your-highlights">available on Kickstarter for $169</a>, a $130 discount from its projected retail price of $299.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="N5L3zeVeukaY3z3si7Sm4j" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N5L3zeVeukaY3z3si7Sm4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Scribe has a barrel design that looks like any other pen, and it isn't all that heavy either. There are pogo pins at the back, and you get a button up top along with one on the side. Obviously, it isn't as smooth to write with as a fountain pen, nor is it as good as Uni-ball's Jetstream gel or Air rollerball products. That said, the Scribe is decent enough in its own right, and you get five refills included in the box.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5015px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="btpFjjnweYtghkFzvU3sri" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/btpFjjnweYtghkFzvU3sri.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5015" height="2825" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4CYSUvPZpJ9BHDKp8XMB8j" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CYSUvPZpJ9BHDKp8XMB8j.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oXRX3uif9ceuF3kxffNhri" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXRX3uif9ceuF3kxffNhri.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="VuAtk3V2GN5AYStT27TYji" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VuAtk3V2GN5AYStT27TYji.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="U2DCdz7kCENeCreNRwMVti" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U2DCdz7kCENeCreNRwMVti.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It's easy to get started with the recording feature of the Scribe: just hold down the top button for two seconds.

The built-in recorder is very good, and it had no problems picking up audio. It's designed to be used in meetings, so I turned to it while attending recent product briefings, and it did a good job highlighting individual speakers.</p><p>You'll need to use the Flowtica app to access stored data, and as of writing, it's available only on iOS. Flowtica notes that it is coming up with an Android app too, but it wasn't available in the testing window. My favorite feature of the Scribe is its ability to automatically transcribe audio to text; while there are plenty of tools that do this today, the sheer convenience is novel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5151px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="jmE6nibhTBmNKxEZRkEjQj" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jmE6nibhTBmNKxEZRkEjQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5151" height="2901" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Transcribed text is available in the Flowtica app, and it analyzes the text to deliver AI-generated summaries as well. They're nifty to have, but not something I normally use — the utility of having transcribed text available just moments after recording is what sells the Scribe for me. You can also save your handwritten notes; just take an image and upload it to the app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="698MxDWvKJw5dvCeHtJNbj" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/698MxDWvKJw5dvCeHtJNbj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4268" height="2404" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI is everywhere these days, and while I'm still ambivalent about most of the utilities that are available, I routinely use transcribing features, and the Scribe does a great job in this regard. The fact that it's a physical product that I can use as a normal pen makes it all the better, and if you're interested in what the Scribe has to offer, you can get your hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flowtica/flowtica-scribe-ai-pen-records-and-understands-your-highlights">AI-enabled pen for $169</a>.

Honestly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-best-sounding-earbuds">it isn't even close</a>. Chalk this up to the software that drives ANC plus the quality of the hardware, but I've used hundreds or pairs of ANC earbuds and headphones and Bose does it the best.</p><p>It's assumed you want the best ANC you can find, but other things are important, too. Bose has you covered. They are chunky lil' fellows but the fit is surprisingly better than you would expect when looking at them. That's important because everyone hates earbuds that don't fit well.</p><p>The sound is pretty good, too. Yes, they are still earbuds with tiny drivers and you're playing back via Bluetooth so it's not the best ever, but as far as ANC earbuds go you'll have no complaints. The buds handle most ranges of sound from bass to treble well, and the mids sound exceptionally good.</p><p>Even the app is really good. It's modern and lets you adjust the sound to your liking while still trying to make things easy; not everyone wants to fiddle with a 10-band virtual equalizer.</p><p>If you only care about getting the best ANC earbuds you can buy, these are for you.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:679px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Eny8jnLK8Kht9tVYgLAuvB" name="AirPods4-lifestyle" alt="Apple AirPods 4." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eny8jnLK8Kht9tVYgLAuvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="679" height="382" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-apple-airpods-4-2"><span class="title__text">2.

The Apple AirPods 4 are no exception.</p><p>When it comes to the best bang for your buck, nothing out there matches these. No, they're not the newest, but you're not paying the price that the newest check in with, either.</p><p>The thing is, you'll either love or hate the way they fit. Apple redesigned the way AirPods fit with the 4th generation, and a lot of folks say they nailed it. Others say it was still terrible. Since they don't use interchangeable parts for fitting, they either fit you or they don't, and nothing can change that.</p><p>Next, I have to talk about battery life. If you need ANC earbuds with a long-lasting battery, these are not for you. You can stretch it out with the case, but with ANC running, don't expect these to last more than four hours on the best of days.</p><p>If you're Ok with the battery and the AirPods 4 fit you well, you'll love the value you're getting. I've seen these on sale for as low as $100, and they are definitely better than most $100 noise-cancelling earbuds. The sound is good (not the best, but far from the worst) and features like transparency and conversational awareness are not expected at this price.</p><p>If good, cheap earbuds with ANC are what you're after, you have to check out the AirPods 4 before you make any buying decisions.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-battery-life"><span>Best battery life</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.06%;"><img id="zec76HCJxykST8HnoXEi8B" name="sony-wf-1000xm5-qi-wireless-charging.jpg" alt="The Sony WF-1000XM5 in black wirelessly charging on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zec76HCJxykST8HnoXEi8B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1749" height="1068" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony / Twitter)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-sony-wf-1000xm5-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">3.

You'll have no complaints about the audio quality, the connectivity, the fit inside your ear, or the noise cancellation itself. Then we get to the battery life.</p><p>It's simply phenomenal. The company rates their use at about 6 hours when using ANC, and that's right in line with what you're going to get. Six hours doesn't sound like a lot (and really, it's never enough), but when you're talking about earbuds with tiny batteries and a power-hungry process like ANC, you won't find long battery life on a spec sheet. These are the best of the best when it comes to time between charges.</p><p>The only real issue I've found is with low-latency audio using Sony's LC3 codec, which can drop audio from time to time.

I love the audio quality they deliver with or without ANC turned on, but I hate that high-quality codec support is limited to newer Galaxy Devices.</p><p>That's the rub—if you use a phone like a Galaxy S24 or S25, you can use Samsung's proprietary SSC Ultra-High-Quality audio codec, and the sound the Buds Pro 3 deliver is, well, better than any wireless earbuds should be able to deliver. It's really that good and better than anything Qualcomm or Sony brings with AptX and LDAC, respectively.</p><p>Part of the reason is the big (for earbuds) 10.3mm drivers used for low and middle-frequency sounds, paired with a 6.1mm planar audio driver for higher-frequency sounds, but Samsung's audio codec does the heavy lifting. There's also no support for LDAC hq audio on other Android phones.</p><p>Still, there is no denying how good these sound with the right source. I tested with a Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus once it was updated to support the SSC codec and could not believe the difference.</p><p>They sound good without using a supported device, and all around, the audio quality, ANC, fit, and app (which you really need for best results) are great.

They do have an excellent fit, and the touch sensitivity is wonderful.</p><p>The real star of the show is Google and its plans for the future.

They <em><strong>don't</strong></em> have wireless charging, support for any HQ audio codecs, and the silicon tips work for most people, but not everyone. But they are about $100 cheaper and come in a cool transparent blue color if you're into something different.</p><p>I really enjoy these earbuds and the way they respond to any sort of software-based equalizer. Out of the box, you probably won't love the way they sound, so you really need to use Sony's app to "tune" them in to your liking.

For most people, the audible hiss and droning buzz ANC causes have disappeared, and you probably will never know that it's turned on and running.</p><p>The reasons are obvious: isolate sound to your ears and you hear more of what you want to hear. Simply having ANC doesn't necessarily mean headphones will block all sounds, so the differences come down to variances. Some headphones will drown out more ambient noise than others will. Thankfully, you don't have to buy the most expensive pair of earbuds with ANC to get great noise cancellation - any pair on this list will do the job well, even the more budget-friendly picks.</p><p>Because they are earbuds, fit and comfort play a big role, too. Wireless earbuds nestled into your ears to provide passive isolation to help block ambient noise, so the way your earbuds fit is important. You'll probably have the best luck with a pair that uses silicon tips of various sizes.</p><p>Apps and software offer additional benefits for ANC. Some may even have "adaptive ANC", which adjusts the potency in real time based on how much noise the onboard microphones detect. You'll find this, if available, in the companion app for your earbuds so be sure to check it out.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-we-test"><span>How we test</span></h3><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Why you can trust Android Central</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">☑️ One of the oldest and most trusted Android sites on the web <br>☑️ Over 15 years of product testing <br>☑️ Thousands of products reviewed and tested since 2007 <br>☑️ Dozens of audio products tested by our team every year</p></div></div><p>We review plenty of headphones and earbuds because almost everyone with a phone has a set or two. Knowing what's good is important.</p><p>I'm also a bit of a headphone addict. I've been known to spend too much time obsessing over the smallest details and have access to most every new product once it's commercially available. So I try them all if I can.</p><p>I've personally used each of these, and while ANC isn't for me, I know what to look for and what works. I like and would recommend every pair on this list, and I think it's the right place to start when it's time to buy a little something for yourself.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For the Moto G 2026, the publication claims the device will see a design pretty similar to what consumers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">received earlier this year</a>. The device will have a flat display with a square camera bump on its rear panel. The post claims the sides are "mostly flat," but they apparently "curve towards both the front and back sides."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.83%;"><img id="XUTBsjbQLjJczbwEQSA9iG" name="motorola-g-2026-leaked-render" alt="A leaked render of the Moto G 2026 with the same design as its 2025 counterpart.

The phone's bezels are a little odd, as they're not exactly thin, and there's also a noticeable "chin" at the bottom. The back is rumored to at least hold a 50MP primary lens, while the selfie camera could debut at 32MP.</p><p>Internally, the post suggests we could see a 5,200mAh battery, which would be only 200mAh higher <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">than the 2024 edition</a>, if true. It also purports 4GB of RAM (with a RAM booster option, too) and 128GB internal storage options. However, this 128GB can be expanded via a microSD, most likely. Motorola is rumored to settle with MediaTek for its G 2026, opting for the Dimensity 6300 SoC.</p><p>This is the same chip that powered the Moto G 2025 and G Power 2025. Motorola is speculated to have Android 16 running on this mid-range device out of the box.</p><h2 id="the-g-play-2">The G Play</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:602px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.67%;"><img id="yQVhgcKNQqJ7ZaDy3dTHB7" name="motorola-g-play-2026-leaked-render" alt="A leaked rendering of the Moto G Play 2026, showing its square rear camera bump and a noticeable bezel chin on its display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yQVhgcKNQqJ7ZaDy3dTHB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="602" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication claims that the Moto G Play will mirror the G 2026, and the renders certainly double down on that speculation. The phones look incredibly similar, even with the square, raised camera bump on the back.</p><p>However, there are some alleged subtle differences. The Moto G Play 2026 will continue the 6.7-inch display (with that noticeable chin) and 4GB of RAM; however, its available storage dips way down to 64GB, though it is "expandable." The G Play 2026 is also allegedly receiving a lower-strength 32MP primary camera and an 8MP selfie camera.</p><p>While the usual Motorola-branded software and other AI features are expected, like the Moto G 2026, the G Play will see a 5,200mAh battery, as well. The post notes that this model will see slower charging compared to its likely launch partner.</p><p>Earlier this year, Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">launched its G 2025 and G Power 2025</a> models, with starting prices under $300. This was a major highlight for the company, as it delivered a pair of good-looking phones for cheap. More than that, they packed some decent batteries and okay charging speeds. They're no flagship, but for a mid-range, they weren't that bad. Also, the company is seemingly shifting its G Play to a design that mirrors these other two models, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2024-launch">the 2024 model didn't</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2024-launch">Moto G Play 2024</a> offered a raised camera bump that is more rectangular than square. Still, Motorola is keeping that noticeable chin on this device, like the rest of the mid-range models it's launched.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Fortunately, an Amazon deal has come along to change all of that. For a limited time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-510BT-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08WM3LMJF" target="_blank"><strong>you can grab 40% off the price of the JBL Tune 510BT headphones</strong></a>, bringing the price down to just $30.</p><p>These foldable, over-ear Bluetooth headphones are said to offer up to 40 hours of battery life, along with a bass-heavy sound, and a USB-C port for quick charging. While they don't feature as many of the bells and whistles as some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a>, they certainly aren't a bad pick for those on a serious budget.</p><p>While they don't feature active noise cancellation, these JBL headphones do include a built-in microphone for easy compatibility with voice assistants such as Google Assistant and Alexa, or for phone and video calls. It's also worth noting that this particular deal is only available for these headphones in the White and Black colors.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.95" data-dimension48="$49.95" href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-510BT-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08WM3LMJF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:118.27%;"><img id="8fMGRHEFxp4bqfqD8TLrQX" name="jbl-tune-510bt-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8fMGRHEFxp4bqfqD8TLrQX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1029" height="1217" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>JBL Tune 510BT Headphones:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-510BT-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08WM3LMJF" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.95" data-dimension48="$49.95" data-dimension25=""><del>$49.95</del> <strong>$29.95 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon is offering these affordable JBL wireless headphones for 40% off the normal price, representing $20 in savings and cutting the price to just $30.

Even at their normal price point of $60, they seem like a decent offering from JBL with up to 40 hours of battery life per charge, and 2 additional hours of listening per 5-minute charge with the USB-C cable.</p><p>They also include a built-in microphone, physical playback and volume controls, and a folding design that makes them pretty easy to stow and transport.</p><p>These come with the JBL Pure Bass sound, according to the company, though users who don't like this can simply EQ audio toward a more treble-oriented sound using their phone's built-in equalization controls. The speaker cups on these are a bit smaller than those of most premium headphones, which can definitely be a positive for some buyers while being a negative for others.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Arriving in Gmail's sidebar (in app and on PC), users will notice a new "Purchases" email label. Google states tapping Purchases will give you a "bird's eye view of all your upcoming package deliveries in one simple, organized list." From this view, users will find an "Arriving Soon" section at the top, similar to what you'd find in your primary inbox.</p><p>This is reserved for packages that should be delivered within the next 24 hours. Below that, users will find the list of emails containing those tracking details and order confirmation. This update is rolling out today (Sep 11) for all personal Gmail accounts, so keep your eye out for it.</p><p>Additionally, Google says the "Arriving Soon" section in your primary email, as well as tracking details within order emails themselves, will not leave.</p><p>The second update concerns Gmail's "Promotions" tab. This tab will now offer a "nudge," bringing up promotions and discounts that are timely, so you're in the loop. More than that, a new sorting option, "Most Relevant," is on the way, which Google says pushes Gmail to display promotions from brands you're more likely to engage with. Users can sort by "most recent," too, if you're interested in just seeing the emails as they arrive.</p><h2 id="gmail-for-the-holidays-2">Gmail for the holidays</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:750px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.00%;"><img id="ggFQFkjSaba5p3iim7JZ8D" name="gmail-purchases-tracking-tab-update" alt="Gmail's getting a new "Purchases" tab, which highlights every order and purchase made in one convenient place for tracking." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ggFQFkjSaba5p3iim7JZ8D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="750" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="i5c56zwBYN684p9FFPJT8D" name="gmail-promotions-tab-sorting-update" alt="Google's updating Gmail's Promotion tab with new sorting options to help users see deals that they care for the most." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i5c56zwBYN684p9FFPJT8D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google, Gmail, and the holidays seem to be a regular thing as of late, as even last year, an update rolled out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-now-uses-a-new-ai-model-to-try-and-fend-off-holiday-scams">help users avoid scams</a>. The company implemented a new AI model in Gmail in December last year to determine what's a scam and what isn't. Google said its AI models were successful in blocking ~20% more scam attempts and are also reviewing 1,000 times more user-reported spam events.</p><p>These protections are still in place, and Google still encourages users to be vigilant on their own.</p><p>A Gemini update for Gmail arrived this year, making it way easier to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-calendar-gemini-ai-add-option-gmail-rollout">take important dates and events from an email</a> and put them into Calendar. If Google's AI detects a date within an email, an "add to calendar" button will appear for convenience. The AI will automatically create an event centered around it, leaving you the choice of further editing that newly created event for clarity.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As if it were in a carnival, Apple's iPhone was found by Google Pixel in a batch of chicken feed, with the cuties running around in the background, too.

Apple Intelligence sort of took a step back, grabbing subtle upgrades over what users already have to play with (though it's still not everything). Apple brought the new Liquid Glass design, Live Translations for audio and text, among others.</p><p>Here's the thing: it's already been a year since Apple debuted its AI intelligence for its iPhone users, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-should-ditch-siri-for-gemini-and-google-cloud-heres-why">and they still haven't gotten</a> everything promised. In fact, most of those features are <em>still </em>delayed. That setback has pushed things back for likely another year. It's not as though Apple doesn't have its own strong, clear vision of what its AI intelligence should look like—it does. But the delays and problems it's encountering have left some wondering if Apple should just settle with Gemini.</p><p>This #BestPhonesForever series on YouTube by Google is its way of having "fun" with Apple, kind of like when it responded to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-teases-apple-iphone-17-pixel-design-copy-rumors">rumors about the iPhone 17's design</a>.

I bought a Galaxy S25 Edge with my own cash and plan to do the same with the iPhone Air, and in this guide, I'll help you figure out how these two smartphones compare.</p><p>For those who don't quite understand the appeal of thin phones, here's a quick overview. There are certainly some people who use every percentage of their phone's battery life each day and all of its features. However, there's also a subset of users that don't need extremely long battery life or a pro-grade camera system. For them, it's arguably better to carry a thin and light phone daily, and add separate tools like a MagSafe/Qi2 battery pack or a dedicated camera when they're really needed.</p><p>If that sounds like you, an iPhone Air or Galaxy S25 Edge might be the change you need. I ditched heavy and thick flagships this year and haven't looked back. But you'll want to pick the right one — here's how to decide.</p><h2 id="iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-design-and-display-2">iPhone Air vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5PB8JekBamAsqENCzYkyhR" name="iPhone-Air-1" alt="The iPhone 17 Air in press renders in all colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5PB8JekBamAsqENCzYkyhR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Smartphone manufacturers have been cheating on thinness for ages with camera bumps and creative math — there isn't a single brand that includes the thickness of the camera bump in their official measurements, and foldable phones even omit the size of the internal bezel when talking about their unfolded measurements.</p><p>However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event">iPhone Air</a> takes this practice to the extreme. It doesn't have a camera bump; it has a camera <em>plateau</em>, and it practically houses the entire phone — the rest of the chassis is filled almost entirely with battery. This strategy makes the iPhone Air feel impossibly thin, with much of the body measuring only 5.6mm thick. At the same time, the plateau will protrude further off the back of the phone than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>By comparison, Samsung made the Galaxy S25 Edge measure 5.8mm thick. The difference of 0.2mm in thickness might sound minuscule, but early first impressions from those who have held the Air seem to show it's a difference you can feel, which may be attributed to its curvier chassis.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-4" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a big difference in screen size and overall form factor between the iPhone Air and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. The former has a 6.5-inch screen, which slots in between what would typically be a base or a plus-sized phone. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch display that's identical in size to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>. Both phones are using AMOLED screens with 120Hz LTPO support, but the iPhone is slightly brighter, topping out at 3,000 nits.</p><p>It's worth noting that due to all the components in the iPhone Air camera plateau, Apple had to shift the Dynamic Island and Face ID sensors down to make everything fit. This means the pill-shaped camera cutout will cut deeper into the iPhone Air display, obstructing more of your content. The Galaxy S25 Edge has a hole-punch camera cutout in the display that's much more minimal than what the iPhone Air offers.</p><p>The iPhone Air also has an anti-reflective coating similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Both phones use a titanium construction for durability and feature IP68 certification against dust and water ingress.</p><p>Personally, I'm torn on which phone looks better. To me, the reasonably small rear camera bump is a huge appeal of the Galaxy S25 Edge, but it's hard not to be impressed by the 5.6mm thickness of the iPhone Air.</p><h2 id="iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hardware-and-specs-2">iPhone Air vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QufzJGHEhvERTdej7qdzkR" name="iPhone-Air-4" alt="The iPhone 17 Air in press renders in all colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QufzJGHEhvERTdej7qdzkR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone Air and Galaxy S25 Edge both impressively retain similar performance to that of their "Pro" and "Ultra" counterparts.

By that logic, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge effectively has <em>three</em> cameras.

On top of that, the Samsung phone has a 12MP ultrawide camera for wide shots.</p><p>Apple's 18MP front-facing camera on the iPhone Air is impressive. It features a square sensor that enables horizontal and portrait selfies without physically rotating the device.

Compared to Apple's thin handset, the Galaxy S25 Edge has a flagship processor without binning, a faster USB-C port, stereo speakers, a rear ultrawide camera, a larger display, and a smaller front-facing camera cutout. However, it's slightly thicker and more expensive than the iPhone Air.</p><p>There's just one reason why it's extremely difficult to recommend the Galaxy S25 Edge over the iPhone Air. The former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">doesn't have Qi2 magnets onboard</a>, and this feels like a mandatory feature for thin phones with shorter battery life. The iPhone Air, having MagSafe and Qi2 support, means you can quickly and easily top up the phone with a battery pack in a pinch. It'll be much tougher to do so on the Galaxy S25 Edge without a case, and adding a case somewhat defeats the point of a thin phone.</p><p>Otherwise, the choice might come down to whether you prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">iOS 26</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>. Neither phone is perfect, but both the iPhone Air and Galaxy S25 Edge are a breath of fresh air for people disenfranchised by thick, heavy smartphones.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="03e3c250-82a4-4fff-a02c-de01413737ec">            <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-air/" data-model-name="Apple iPhone Air" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fmPbGHUfnJhg6TM3t6ypnW.jpg' alt="The iPhone Air in Cloud White against a white background."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone Air</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Thin above all else</strong></em></p><p>The iPhone Air is for people who want a futuristic-feeling phone with thinness that feels too good to be true.

You have a similar design with a stem style and earbuds with white ear tips and a transparent-looking stem with silver finishes inside.</p><p>The case also looks similar to what we have seen before, with a new silver finish for the bottom and a transparent lid, like previous designs. However, this is where things get interesting.</p><h2 id="nothing-s-case-gets-more-functional-2">Nothing's case gets more functional</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">18th September 📆Nothing ear (3) pic.twitter.com/NvHbWXVQpn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1966140666834202942">September 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The teaser shows a new "Talk" button right up front in the earbuds' case. The USB-C port on the right also seems to have a new microphone and/or speaker next to it.</p><p>Nothing hasn't gone into details, but in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/41833-offbeat-looks-stronger-signal-material-difference">community post</a>, the company calls this a "Super Mic." It's unclear what the new "Talk" button does, but we expect it relates to talking to an AI chatbot directly through the earbuds' case.</p><p>Another new detail about the case is that Nothing has used "100% anodised recycled aluminium," which the company says provides improved durability and a premium finish. In addition, the company says it has refined the earbuds’ design by minimizing clearance between components and has also "reengineered the metal antenna to a flat finish and controlled its thickness to just 0.35 mm."</p><p>The company hasn't revealed new features or full specs yet, based on past launches, it's likely we'll see more details ahead of launch. Pricing and availability details are likely to be announced at the official launch on September 18, 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>
