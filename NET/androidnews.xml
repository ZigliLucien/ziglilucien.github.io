From phones to tablets, e-readers, and even monitors, I've been trying to get more eye-friendly displays into my daily life to alleviate the strain that backlights put on our eyes and brains.</p><p>But while E Ink phones are fantastic, they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/an-e-ink-phone-isnt-something-you-just-switch-to-in-one-day">not something you switch to overnight</a>. An E Ink phone's display is less capable in most ways when compared to a standard smartphone display. They normally can't display colors at all, although a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions" target="_blank">color E Ink tablets</a> now exist, and their refresh rates mean that watching videos isn't a pleasant experience.</p><p>By definition, most E Ink phones can be considered "minimalist" phones. But is a camera a necessity that falls in with a minimalist lifestyle? Each of these phones has a camera, and while it does take <em>color</em> pictures, you might want to carry a second phone — or a standard camera — around with you.</p><h2 id="color-photos-black-and-white-screen-2">Color photos, black and white screen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aZsffDvc8HtLMyGPmSzt8d" name="mudita-kompact-vs-minimal-phone-back-cameras-03" alt="Comapring the camera software on the Minimal Phone to the Mudita Kompakt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZsffDvc8HtLMyGPmSzt8d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After getting my first E Ink phone, one of the first thoughts that occurred to me was how the camera works.

Kompakt takes better pictures, in general. Its images are softer, but colors are far more accurate, dynamic range is substantially better in most circumstances, and it's less likely to take blurry photos than the Minimal Phone.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZO_sXk21Sks" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Ironically, the Minimal Phone is the one that's got a better camera software experience. All of this revolves around speed, though, not quality. You can quickly launch the camera by double-tapping the power button on the Minimal Phone, something Android fans have gotten used to and love, while the Mudita Kompakt requires you to unlock the phone first, then tap the camera.</p><p>Once you're in the camera app, the viewfinder speed and photo capture speed on the Minimal Phone are also quite a bit faster. The problem is that the screen's refresh rate is sometimes buggy, and launching the camera will default to the slowest refresh rate, making image capture a pretty awful experience until you switch the refresh rate back. The video above will show you this in action.</p><h2 id="opening-up-the-possibilities-2">Opening up the possibilities</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8fs6dz6B7YVvT7dPzmBY8d" name="mudita-kompact-vs-minimal-phone-back-cameras-01" alt="Comapring the backs of the Minimal Phone to the Mudita Kompakt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8fs6dz6B7YVvT7dPzmBY8d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A friend of mine with a Minimal Phone tipped me off to a camera hack that works pretty well most of the time. Instead of using the built-in camera app, just download the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera">Open Camera app</a> from the Google Play Store and use the camera2 API.</p><p>That last part seems daunting, but it's actually quite easy and can be done with any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. Just open the Open Camera app, click the settings wheel in the top right, scroll down to <em>camera API</em>, then select camera2 from the list. This setting will stick, so you shouldn't have to do it again.</p><p>For the most part, using this app with camera2 selected makes a notable difference in camera quality. I found some exceptions, but I'd say it's better 80% of the time. Here are a few examples as proof.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="S4HmyWan4bm4rBbGGbHHpJ" name="minimal-phone-camera-app-comparison-01" alt="Comparing the stock camera app to the Open Camera app with camera2 API on the Minimal Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4HmyWan4bm4rBbGGbHHpJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="dgcMHwC67nC2yP43MhvusJ" name="minimal-phone-camera-app-comparison-02" alt="Comparing the stock camera app to the Open Camera app with camera2 API on the Minimal Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgcMHwC67nC2yP43MhvusJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="sbjWXLBNSbVv4QhzY96PqJ" name="minimal-phone-camera-app-comparison-03" alt="Comparing the stock camera app to the Open Camera app with camera2 API on the Minimal Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sbjWXLBNSbVv4QhzY96PqJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>In general, Open Camera, with the camera2 API selected, regularly delivers better image detail, a wider dynamic range, and more accurate colors. I included the selfie one as one weird example that doesn't jive with the others, although Open Camera still delivered better color accuracy than the built-in Minimal Phone camera app.</p><p>If you pick up a Minimal Phone, I recommend switching to Open Camera as your default camera app. The occasional quality enhancement is worth it.</p><p>Regardless of which of these two phones you pick, however, I'd recommend sticking a second phone in your other pocket to use as a camera. Even an older phone will do, just wipe the data on it and use it only as a camera for the most important moments. If nothing else, a compact digital camera will also do the job.</p><p>Either way, E Ink phones are best for staving your digital addictions and healing your eyes, not taking good photos. If you're not ready to jump onto the E Ink phone, maybe try picking up an Android-powered, phone-sized e-reader like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a> or Palma 2 and ease your way into the experience, instead.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="104a0541-1099-4652-87d9-d6a5678a3f3a">            <a href="https://minimalcompany.com/" data-model-name="Minimal Phone"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SzBBBqxxfLtGYtiZGTC4Xi.jpg' alt="The Minimal Phone in black"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Minimal Phone</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Minimal Phone is a call back to simpler times, when hardware keyboards reigned supreme and phone were more utilitarian than flashy.

It's capable of running the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/">Llama 3.2 edge AI model</a> with one billion parameters on smart glasses — no phone required. And this could transform the next generation of smart glasses.</p><p>Qualcomm VP of XR Ziad Asghar wore TCL RayNeo X3 Pro AR glasses on stage at AWE, showing off the option to speak with the AI using a small language model (SLM) without any internet connection or phone back-up.</p><p>Aside from answering questions, Qualcomm-powered smart glasses will use cameras to interpret your surroundings and provide context on what you're seeing. The Qualcomm chip has a 1.2-second time to first token (TTFT), cutting down on the usual cloud-query delay.</p><p>Smart glasses still won't be "standalone" until they get cellular support and on-device apps, and the Llama 3.2 model will still need outside help sometimes. But this makes smart glasses feel more like proper next-gen tech, not just Bluetooth phone accessories.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SnR5Yt3ChX2MsZnpnQhM5C" name="AR1+ Gen 1 Platform Details.JPG" alt="A Qualcomm presentation slide showing the upgrades that the Snapdragon AR1+ Gen 1 chipset has, including a smaller package, better power management, premium image quality, and powerful on-glass AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnR5Yt3ChX2MsZnpnQhM5C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus</a> SoC in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">Project Moohan</a>, the new Snapdragon AR1 Plus Gen 1 chipset will be marketed for more pro-level AI glasses.</p><p>Qualcomm says this new chipset reduces smart glasses' temple height by 20%, so they won't stand out as much compared to normal glasses.</p><p>It supposedly uses less power for functions like computer vision, Wake with Voice standby, and Video Streaming, while also delivering "enhanced image quality" with improved image stabilization and a multi-frame engine that combines photos for improved lighting.</p><p>Intriguingly, it appears that Qualcomm is working on using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> as a controller for AR glasses, with gesture control, motion tracking, health monitoring, and 3DoF control listed as options.

The leaked render shows a major glow-down, with no trace of Nothing's flashy Glyph lights.</p><p>At first glance, Max Jambor's Nothing Phone 3 leak looks like business as usual. However, when you zoom in, you'll notice that Nothing has axed the signature Glyph lights, which have made Nothing phones stand out. What's left is a cleaner but generic back panel that could belong to any phone.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There have already been quite a few teasers and leaks, but that's not enough.

This leak just poured concrete on Glyph’s grave. That Phone 3 render shows a backside with zero lights.</p><p>The render also reveals some interesting design choices, particularly around the camera array. While it maintains the expected triple-lens setup, the execution feels like a deliberate compromise between previous models.</p><p>The camera bump strikes a middle ground, and it's more pronounced than the standard Phone 2a, yet subtler than the Pro variant. What’s particularly interesting is how this blends elements from both mainstream and Pro models, suggesting Nothing might be refining rather than reinventing its visual language.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:483px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:178.05%;"><img id="rdQStXSVhjJd78u2T3DSQ9" name="Nothing-Phone-3-render" alt="render of the Nothing Phone 3's back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rdQStXSVhjJd78u2T3DSQ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="483" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Max Jambor / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, the Essential Key appears alongside the standard power and volume buttons on the side of the device.

If the rumors hold, we’re likely looking at a centered punch-hole camera (no notch in sight) and ultra-thin bezels.</p><p>From what this render shows, most of the internals are hidden behind what looks like solid gray panels, unlike previous models.</p><p>Is Nothing moving to a faux-transparent design? Right now, it’s hard to tell if we’re getting actual transparency. Either way, it’s a noticeable shift from Nothing's previous designs where you could at least peek at some components.</p><p>Nothing has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-sets-a-date-for-its-phone-3-launch-and-its-not-too-far-away">officially stamped July 1 as the big day for the Phone 3's debut</a>, so mark your calendar.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it'll now sit above a squircle chassis, making the overall footprint of the smartwatch larger. Rumors also point to the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic having three hardware buttons, including the customizable action button from the Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>Reports say that the 46mm or 47mm variant of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will measure 46 x 46.5 x 14.2 mm. However, considering that Samsung usually omits the protruding biosensors from its dimensions, the true thickness of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic could be around 17mm. Either way, it'll be bigger overall than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Xyb2LEjopek4Ege2FYrYW6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-rotating-bezel-close.jpg" alt="Looking closely at the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic's rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xyb2LEjopek4Ege2FYrYW6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For perspective, the 47mm model of the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic has dimensions of 46.5 x 46.5 x 10.9 mm, excluding the sensors on the back. Still, if you account for that, it's still thinner than the rumored specs of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. Although the weight of the upcoming model is unknown, the current Galaxy Watch 6 Classic weighs 59 grams.</p><p>It's unclear whether Samsung will offer the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in multiple sizes.

I love everything from Afro-futurism to speculative fiction to giant robot anime, so when I received a pitch from Gravastar to test their new kit, I was definitely interested. Upon reviewing the website, I noticed that they offer various keyboards, mice, and Bluetooth speakers, all futuristic, mech-themed hardware.</p><p>Often, the problem with collectibles is that they can be “low-hanging fruit.” I love interesting hoodies, and I have plenty of them. A famous DJ has his own line of licensed hoodies and prints various anime drops with gorgeous graphics on those hoodies. However, the cost often does not match the build quality of the hoodies. So, I was in love with the bold graphics, but very much underwhelmed by the construction and weight of the hoodies.</p><p>With that said, I had two primary concerns about checking out the Gravastar Mars Pro V2 Bluetooth speaker: Would the build quality be trash? Would Gravastar focus on aesthetics, to the detriment of the sound quality?</p><p>After running that speaker on my desktop setup connected to two different computers and a Google Pixel 9 via Bluetooth and wired for a few weeks, I have my answers — and they come with good news!</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Gravastar Mars Pro V2</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C to 3.5mm cable</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Codecs supported</p></td><td  ><p>SBC, AAC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Drivers</p></td><td  ><p>Dual speaker system with passive bass radiator</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>15 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RGB modes</p></td><td  ><p>6 solid colors, gradient pulse mode, music sync mode </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="built-like-a-giant-robot-2">Built like a giant robot!</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="9Q5SRUkCMShp3AYdXsFrb4" name="" alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2 front view showing the RGB lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Q5SRUkCMShp3AYdXsFrb4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are video games and manga/anime "mechs," giant, pilot-driven robots like Voltron or Evangelion. Then there's the Gravastar Mars Pro V2, which is mech-themed, but aesthetically speaking, it’s more like tech out of a Terminator movie.</p><p>Weighing just over 2 lbs., this round speaker with a zinc alloy shell has a reassuring heft. It <em>feels</em> like a high-quality collectible. That’s important because at $200, which is occasionally on sale, you would have some serious buyer’s remorse if the Gravastar Mars Pro V2 felt “plasticky” and low-quality.</p><p>The speaker’s main body and legs are equipped with beautifully placed, vibrant RGB lights that offer six different solid colors, a gradient mode that cycles through the colors, and a music sync mode.</p><p>These are controlled right from a button on the back of the speaker, where most controls are located. I'll note that the music sync mode is merely okay. The lights pulse and vibrate close to the beat of whatever you’re listening to. I found the gradient color cycle mode to be much more pleasing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Q5Cip8Kimzv7Di8hdqbXs3" name="" alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2 with its legs folded. and RGB lighting on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q5Cip8Kimzv7Di8hdqbXs3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Gravastar Mars Pro V2 with its legs folded and RGB lighting on. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The legs offer some basic articulation, which allows the speaker to be elevated, minimizing surface vibrations and ultimately producing better sonics. Small rubber bumpers on the outstretched legs’ contact surfaces help dampen those vibrations.</p><p>You’ll find the touch-sensitive volume controls that work like a charm at the top of the speaker body. Responsive to touch, and the lighting follows responsively as well, stepping through volume levels as you slide your finger along the strip.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="g8FSpmuUboqEgW5QHYkSr3" name="" alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2 volume touch controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g8FSpmuUboqEgW5QHYkSr3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="C724NmVca8jfp2SMEHJEz3" name="" alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2 RGB lighting behind the speaker grille" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C724NmVca8jfp2SMEHJEz3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="eVXgyZ2zgon9XFDZrTzDn3" name="" alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2 RGB green lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVXgyZ2zgon9XFDZrTzDn3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="id7URjsHjWbY64LaCrUEj3" name="" alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2 RGB red lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/id7URjsHjWbY64LaCrUEj3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VXijMqWVfHzZ4KWw28cVe3" name="" alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2 RGB magenta lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VXijMqWVfHzZ4KWw28cVe3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>With the Mars Pro V2 in front of you, the 20-watt, dual-speaker system features a 2.5” full-range speaker and a 1” high-frequency tweeter.</p><p>The RGB lighting on the front not only throws light at you but also beautifully illuminates the speaker behind a honeycomb metal grill, as seen in the second slide in the gallery above.

The sound quality is surprisingly good for a speaker this size, which looks so good and is so niche.</p><p>I connected the speaker to my iMac Pro via Bluetooth, then a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Microsoft Surface Pro 11</a> via Bluetooth and the supplied USB-C to 3.5mm cable, which connects to the USB-C port on the bottom of the speaker. The placement of the port is an interesting decision, and if you're going to leave it plugged in, you'll want to consider a USB-C with a right angle. Alternatively, you can spend a few dollars more and buy their bundle that includes the mech-themed charging base/stand.</p><p>I tried that same wired connection with a different 3.5mm cable, and it didn’t work, so be aware of that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="B7YQtnVjSHjjLd6nNB4pK" name="" alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2's USB-C port on the underside of the unit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B7YQtnVjSHjjLd6nNB4pK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a 20-watt speaker with only a passive bass radiator, the Gravastar Mars Pro V2 produces bright highs, punchy mids, and desk-rattling bass response. That said, due to the physics involved, you aren’t going to get much in the way of sub-bass. Playing Skrillex’s “Mumbai Power” and JID’s “Bruuuh - Remix” hit me with desk vibrating bass reproduction that was entertaining and appeased my inner bass head.</p><p>The intense sub-bass that both songs are known for is flat, but that’s to be expected. I find that issue with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers" target="_blank">any of the smaller Bluetooth speakers we've tested</a> that don't have an active subwoofer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="SGPKGHtMbpQqK2XXJTfy44" name="" alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2's passive bass radiator" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SGPKGHtMbpQqK2XXJTfy44.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The large passive bass radiator on the rear of the speaker </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The technical quality of your music files will impact the clarity and nuance reproduced by the Mars Pro. I played audiophile-grade FLAC files with the Surface Pro and Pixel 9, and the speaker gave me admirable sonic images. “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” and “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the “Get Out” OST both had satisfying soundstages that gave a strong sense of depth and texture. The latter song’s haunting lyrical performance was bright and clear, with an engrossingly dark, resonant bassline.</p><p>As for GravaStar’s claims of this being the perfect speaker for audiophiles? Some audiophiles will most certainly debate that claim. The Sonics lack the subtle nuance in the mids that audiophiles would typically look for. “Wanna Be Startin’ Something” from Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” album has barely discernible backing vocals in its intro that, with audiophile-grade kit, are much better represented during playback.</p><p>With the Mars Pro, if you didn’t know that element was there in the mix, you’d miss it. The overall sound signature of the Mars Pro V2 is warmer in the bass and mids, with more emphasis on those frequencies than the highs. Listening to lower-quality, lower data files like MP3s further exposes this tuning.</p><h2 id="the-mech-experience-2">The “mech” experience</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="mRp2TN7rpjvqfsY9e3ocH4" name="" alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2 shot in low light to show off the lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mRp2TN7rpjvqfsY9e3ocH4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I mentioned the lighting experience earlier, but the rest of the futuristic mech experience is equally enjoyable and polished as most of the light show. Powering up the speaker makes a neat tone like a mech coming online. The same is true when powering down. When the battery starts running low, I get a verbal “Not enough energy” warning, with vocal notifications that are high quality and entirely on theme for the product. There are plenty of various mech sounds, beeps, and digital sound effects.</p><p>Speaking of “not enough energy,” you’ll likely get the full battery life of 15 hours that Gravastar advertises, but the volume at which you play sound, and some other factors like genre (bass-heavy in particular), will affect that battery life.</p><p>As good as this single speaker sounds, I’d love to hear two playing together, which you can do through smart connection options. There’s a TWS (True Stereo Sound) mode, allowing you to connect two and playback audio with stereo fidelity. A Party Mode also allows you to daisy-chain multiple Mars Pro V2s for amplified sound.</p><p>The GravaStar Mars Pro V2 wouldn’t be complete without a full set of collectible-grade desktop accessories. Their Mercury K1 Pro keyboard with RGB lighting and that spider-like, hunter-killer drone design language would be a lot of fun as part of a themed setup. Their M1 Pro mouse follows a similar aesthetic but with a ribbed, see-through, skeletal look that is quite appealing in the images I’ve seen.</p><h2 id="a-cool-high-quality-speaker-2">A cool high-quality speaker</h2><p>For those looking to create a futuristic, mech-themed desktop experience in their gaming room, office, or wherever, a Gravastar Mars Pro V2, or two, would be a high-quality addition. You can even purchase a themed charging cradle for the speaker to sit on, so it’s always ready to go. That said, I would love to see a plug-in version of the V2 that you don’t have to turn on every time you turn your computer on.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a0a5299a-c679-42b8-94c8-b971ccc4cafc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B3N8g8vStCwsxdQmCp4HXn.jpg' alt="Gravastar Mars Pro V2 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Gravastar Mars Pro V2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Go!

Samsung is already teasing new improvements set to arrive with the Galaxy Watch 8, including a major redesign, Gemini control, and new health and fitness features. The smartwatch is still unannounced, but official teasers paired with unofficial leaks give us a pretty good idea of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 will bring this summer.</p><p>Let's speculate on how the Galaxy Watch 8 will compare to the OnePlus Watch 3, and help you figure out whether Samsung's watch is worth waiting for.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-oneplus-watch-3-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 vs. OnePlus Watch 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uoJGbHLooC3vBViRDtRqA" name="oneplus-watch-3-green-watchface" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with a green watchface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uoJGbHLooC3vBViRDtRqA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is rumored to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>'s design more aggressive and bulky, more closely matching the look of the Galaxy Watch Ultra. That's good news for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, as it also features a large and noisy design. Samsung will likely have the advantage of offering multiple sizes, so people with smaller wrists will actually want to wear the Galaxy Watch 8 compared to the OnePlus Watch 3. But still, these two watches prove loud design is in.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 will feature an "innovative design," according to Daniel Araujo, Samsung's corporate VP of the MX Division. In an earnings call, Araujo teased the upcoming smartwatch, saying Samsung will "launch a new Galaxy Watch with an innovative design and enhanced health-related features."</p><p>The long-term plan is to make Samsung wearables more successful "with a strengthened premium experience while expanding our lineup across all price segments."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-series-imagery-squircle-quick-button-leaks">Leaks and rumors</a> fill the gaps here, as the graphics below reveal that a squircle housing with a circular screen within will make up the Galaxy Watch 8's design language. The screen size will likely be unchanged, but the case size of the Galaxy Watch 8 could increase to accommodate the design tweaks. Samsung will almost certainly still offer multiple sizes, possibly 40mm and 44mm options, to make the Galaxy Watch 8 work for everyone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.99%;"><img id="rA8x92xSnWTA8k4dJkeC4V" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leaked-graphics" alt="A set of leaked graphics of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 and 8 Classic with a "squircle" design and a "Quick" button on the latter." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rA8x92xSnWTA8k4dJkeC4V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="962" height="327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 is less versatile, no matter how good its specs are on paper.

Although the hardware isn't likely to be changed — unless we get a surprise feature like blood-glucose monitoring — Samsung could expand the uses for its BioActive sensor.</p><p>This could be the new fitness and health features Samsung executives alluded to in their recent earnings call. Thus, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 may simply have more sensors and data points available than the OnePlus Watch 3.

Gemini support will arrive on Galaxy Watch "in the coming months," per the company, and that seems to line up with the Galaxy Watch 8's expected launch window.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 runs Wear OS 5, but could get all these upgrades with a later upgrade to Wear OS 6. Its use of Wear OS 5 and RTOS guarantees that the Watch 3 will have better battery life than the Galaxy Watch 8, regardless of Wear OS 6 improvements. The Watch 3 could get better with future upgrades, too.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-oneplus-watch-3-worth-waiting-for-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 vs. OnePlus Watch 3: Worth waiting for?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WGZgTmZNP7HvmmkEasDfyB" name="oneplus-watch-3-bands-detached" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with the watch display on and the bands detached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WGZgTmZNP7HvmmkEasDfyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're likely a little over a month away from learning more about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, if recent trends hold.

So, is it worth waiting for the Galaxy Watch 8, or should you go out and buy the OnePlus Watch 3 now?</p><p>If you like the design of the OnePlus Watch 3 and value battery life above all else, the decision is pretty clear. At $350, the smartwatch is an impeccable value, and no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS device</a> can compete with OnePlus' battery life achievements.

Samsung is said to be moving to its own Samsung Exynos processors for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 series, including the flagship model and the "Fan Edition" model. These could be different chips for the more expensive and less expensive models. Of course, the current Galaxy Z Flip 6 is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</a> processor.</p><p>People who love Qualcomm Snapdragon chips might immediately prefer the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for this reason. Truth be told, we don't know how the Exynos chip in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE might compare to the Snapdragon chip in the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Rumors indicate the brand could use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">Exynos 2400 or 2400e</a>, which will be last-generation chips at the time of release.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE (rumored or assumed)</strong></p><p> </p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (One UI 8) </p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (One UI 6.1.1, upgradeable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Yellow, Silver Shadow, Mint, Blue, Black, White, Peach</p></td><td  ><p>Blue, Yellow, Mint, Silver Shadow (Samsung exclusive Crafted Black, White, Peach)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Sizes</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch (inner)</p><p>3.4-inch (outer)</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch (inner)</p><p>3.4-inch (outer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolutions</p></td><td  ><p>2,640 x 1,080 (inner)</p><p>720 x 748 (outer)</p></td><td  ><p>2,640 x 1,080 (inner)</p><p>720 x 748 (outer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Types</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x (inner)</p><p>Super AMOLED (outer)</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x (inner)</p><p>Super AMOLED (outer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rates</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz (inner)</p><p>60Hz (outer)</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz (inner)</p><p>60Hz (outer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos 2400</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Dolby Atmos)</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Dolby Atmos)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Yes (15W)</p></td><td  ><p>Yes (15W)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sizes</p></td><td  ><p>165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm (open), 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mm (closed)</p></td><td  ><p>165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm (open), 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mm (closed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>187 grams</p></td><td  ><p>187g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Other hardware upgrades, like battery capacity and charging speeds, aren't expected.

If true, that means both Galaxy Z Flip phones will feature a 50MP main sensor and a 12MP ultrawide lens on the back. The front-facing camera would be a 10MP sensor. The new 50MP main camera was added to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 this year, so it's the best we've seen in a Samsung foldable.</p><p>It's also possible that Samsung gives the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE less memory than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Some rumors indicate we could see 8GB on the cheaper model, down from 12GB on the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-vs-galaxy-z-flip-6-which-should-you-buy-or-wait-for-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE vs. Galaxy Z Flip 6: Which should you buy (or wait for)?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tXDQqSeXHzTkzr9TW392pH" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-render-hero" alt="A leaked look at the front and back of a minty green Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tXDQqSeXHzTkzr9TW392pH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1660" height="934" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and the current Galaxy Z Flip 6 are rumored to share so many similarities that it may be difficult to choose between the two. Still, we can help you narrow down your options. For one, if you need a foldable phone in the near future, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is your pick. It's available now, and who knows when the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE will officially be announced — right now, it's looking like a long Q4 2025 wait, although that can change.</p><p>The other major difference between these two phones is said to be their processor. If you absolutely have to have a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is your only option. However, there may be key advantages to going with the Exynos-powered Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE instead, such as battery life, efficiency, and AI improvements.</p><p>For many, it'll come down to price. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE should hit an attractive price point, but it's crucial to remember that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will start seeing major discounts too. As we get closer to the Galaxy Z Flip 7's expected release date, we'll likely see more rumors and leaks that bring more clarity to this comparison.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="530c29b5-238e-4ed6-b14e-dbc2e95611c1">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gfRZrkJpVKUqkbwPFncuXX.jpg' alt="Leaked render of the Galaxy Z Flip 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The uncertain choice</strong></em></p><p>There's a lot that we don't know about the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE.

Those phones are slated to launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york">sometime in July at a launch event in New York City</a>. However, some reports indicate that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE won't debut until the fourth quarter of this year, spreading out Samsung's foldable releases, while others suggest it could arrive at Samsung's summer foldable launch.</p><p>If it does launch later this year, it would follow the pattern of Samsung's typical "Fan Edition" launches. For the Galaxy S series, the flagship lineup releases in January with a Fan Edition following months later. It would also avoid the possibility of Samsung cannibalizing Galaxy Z Flip 7 sales with a cheaper Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE on launch day.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Motorola Razr 2025 became publicly available on May 15, 2025, and is widely accessible for purchase. The phone comes in Pantone Spring Bud, Pantone Gibraltar Sea, Pantone Parfait Pink, and Pantone Lightest Sky colorways. There's one storage configuration available with 256GB of space and 8GB of memory. It retails for $700, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-best-motorola-razr-razr-plus-razr-ultra-2025-deals">there are some great deals to be had</a>.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-vs-motorola-razr-2025-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE vs. Motorola Razr 2025: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1659px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="oPTnnZfEcv6xwnPKVnMKTA" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-render-bend" alt="A leaked look at a minty green Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE with a slight bend, showing off its alleged 3.4-inch cover screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oPTnnZfEcv6xwnPKVnMKTA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1659" height="933" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of design, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is expected to retain a similar form factor and design language to the current Galaxy Z Flip 6.

In some ways, that means the base-model Razr 2025's cover screen will look better and more futuristic than Samsung's folder-style shape.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2025 would have an objectively larger cover screen measuring 3.6 inches, while the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE would sport a smaller 3.4-inch panel. As for specs, the Razr 2025 has a 90Hz, pOLED cover screen. By comparison, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE will likely be limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, just as the current model. In this area, the Razr 2025's cover screen will almost certainly be superior.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="72cNt9ST9BUNSBHvvtPkQB" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-2" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 half-opened with Apple Music playing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/72cNt9ST9BUNSBHvvtPkQB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the inside, the Motorola Razr 2025 won't have as big of an advantage.

Per current rumors, the company will use one of its own Exynos processors instead of a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip. Due to the high cost of flagship Qualcomm processors, switching to an Exynos processor — likely the Exynos 2400 — could help Samsung shave a significant cost off the phone's bill of materials.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">Exynos 2400</a> won't perform as well as comparable Snapdragon processors, but Exynos chips are usually more efficient. That could help the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE last longer while using a relatively small 4,000mAh battery. In terms of performance, the Motorola Razr 2025's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a> chip probably won't be meaningfully better or worse than the Exynos chip expected to power the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE (rumored or assumed)</strong></p><p> </p></th><th  ><p><strong>Motorola Razr 2025</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (One UI 8) </p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (Hello UX)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Yellow, Silver Shadow, Mint, Blue, Black, White, Peach</p></td><td  ><p>Pantone Spring Bud, Pantone Gibraltar Sea, Pantone Parfait Pink, Pantone Lightest Sky</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Sizes</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch (inner)</p><p>3.4-inch (outer)</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch (inner)</p><p>3.6-inch (outer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolutions</p></td><td  ><p>2,640 x 1,080 (inner)</p><p>720 x 748 (outer)</p></td><td  ><p>413ppi (inner)</p><p>413ppi (outer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Types</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x (inner)</p><p>Super AMOLED (outer)</p></td><td  ><p>AMOLED, FHD+ HDR10+ (inner)</p><p>pOLED (outer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rates</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz (inner)</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz (inner), 90Hz (outer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos 2400</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB LPDDR4X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB UFS 2.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 13MP ultra-wide, 32MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Dolby Atmos)</p></td><td  ><p>Dual Stereo Speakers (Dolby Atmos)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,500mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Yes (15W)</p></td><td  ><p>Yes (30W)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sizes</p></td><td  ><p>165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm (open), 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mm (closed)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 171.30 x 7.25mm (open), 73.99 x 88.08 x 15.85mm (closed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>187 grams</p></td><td  ><p>188g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both phones will be equipped with 8GB of memory, according to Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE leaks.

But if you can live with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">only a few years of guaranteed support</a>, the Motorola Razr 2025 is hands-down the best budget foldable you can buy today.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is still a considerable distance away, if the rumored Q4 2025 release date proves to be accurate.

Yeah, that still happens to me, except I don't have to go to the store, as the answer is just a Google search away. But I'm not always playing games on my computer, and even if I'm playing a handheld connected to the internet, I don't want to sift through a bunch of links that may or may not have what I'm looking for.</p><p>Last month, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/en-gb/products/rg557">Anbernic RG557</a> was released, and a recent update introduced "Anbernic AI." Essentially, it's a chatbot that resides on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles" target="_blank">gaming handheld</a>, designed to provide answers and even translations. After a bit of digging, I found that it's reliant on either Deepseek or Alibaba's Qwen LLMs. That doesn't leave me feeling great, but it got me wondering if I could just make one myself.</p><p>With tools like Gemini Gems and ChatGPT GPTs, I set out trying to replicate what Anbernic did, but using AI chatbots that I trust a bit more and trying to get them working on the handheld. It didn't quite work out how I had hoped, but fortunately, that's where NotebookLM came to my rescue.</p><h2 id="my-failed-attempts-2">My failed attempts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZqCodZARkgNyfxY3EmvdyN" name="anbernic-ai-rg557" alt="Anbernic AI main screen on the RG557" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZqCodZARkgNyfxY3EmvdyN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No, I didn't use Gemini to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-used-gemini-to-create-a-website-heres-what-happened">build a website</a> or even an app. Instead, I decided now would be a good time to create a Gemini Gem. These were introduced last year, with Google describing them as being "your custom AI experts."</p><p>My original idea was that I'd be able to create a Gem and then, when I needed some help or had a question, I could talk to it using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a>. With the recent addition of screen recording, it seems like a no-brainer, as I don't have to try and describe what I'm seeing, I can just show Gemini. Or so I thought.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KcR7JnGvLMXQrMQfZThmBk" name="Gemini-Live-S25-Pixel-9" alt="Gemini Live on the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcR7JnGvLMXQrMQfZThmBk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, you can't yet use Gems with Gemini Live, which is a bummer. Instead, you're stuck with "regular" Gemini for the time being, and while it's <em>fine,</em> I liked the idea of having a Gemini experience dedicated to gaming.</p><p>Initially, this is where the story would've ended, as I was able to get Gemini running on my aforementioned RG557. However, curiosity got the better of me, so I wanted to see if the same thing could be achieved with ChatGPT. The app won't run on the RG557, as it's technically rooted, despite having a locked bootloader, and there is no current way around this hurdle.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nYKE4frfaTHfVSZZ4q4Y4P" name="chatgpt-anbernic-rg557" alt="ChatGPT app won't work on the Anbernic RG557" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nYKE4frfaTHfVSZZ4q4Y4P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, the next thing I did was fire up the ChatGPT app on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. After a bit of poking around, I found that OpenAI offers a similar feature to Gemini Live, and it even told me it would share some lore about the Star Wars universe when I opened <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-premium-android-games">KOTOR II</a>.</p><p>Sadly, it's the same story as Gemini, as you aren't able to use the "Live" experience with created GPTs. Hopefully, this won't be the case forever, as it would be nice to see the feature parity between Gemini and ChatGPT continue.</p><h2 id="notebooklm-to-the-rescue-2">NotebookLM to the rescue</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="myRcwphedthihPTsqjY9ui" name="Discover-Sources-Notebook-LM" alt="A promotional image for the Discover sources feature in NotebookLM." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/myRcwphedthihPTsqjY9ui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then came along another tangentially related idea. Google has been super-charging NotebookLM, but it's one of those tools that I always seem to forget about. There are a few projects that I have in which NotebookLM could be useful for me, but first, I was curious about how it would do as a gaming encyclopedia of sorts.</p><p>There are limitations with NotebookLM, as you can upload only 50 "sources" to one notebook. However, thanks to being subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Pro</a>, I'm able to add 300 sources. I say "only" because the idea is to source and upload strategy guides for a variety of retro games.</p><p>Needless to say, there are many more than 300 out there, so I opted to take a different approach. Instead, I decided to create notebooks based on the series of games, meaning I'll have one for Mario, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Fallout, and so on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Nx8pFRt8YnYVajaqDgXSCP" name="how-to-win-super-mario-bros-galaxy-z-fold-6" alt="How to win at Super Mario Bros. on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nx8pFRt8YnYVajaqDgXSCP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to the gaming community, a lot of those old Nintendo Power and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://primagames.com/">Prima strategy guides</a> have been archived. It was simply a matter of sourcing, downloading, and uploading them all to NotebookLM.</p><p>However, there was the small problem that many of these old strategy guides are stored in either a CBR or CBZ format. This is no good, as NotebookLM only recognizes PDF, TXT, Markdown, or Audio files when uploading. On the bright side, some quick research revealed that you can convert those CBR or CBZ files to PDF using Calibre. And it's much faster than trying to use any of the "free" online conversion tools.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3296px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DghxfuoUKXDD3ExC7mXQ3N" name="notebooklm-error-adding-cbz-sources" alt="File type error when uploading incompatible source files to NotebookLM" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DghxfuoUKXDD3ExC7mXQ3N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3296" height="1854" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With that out of the way, I started uploading a few files and then just waited for that to finish. You'd be surprised at how large some of these PDF files can be, and NotebookLM has a size limit of 200MB per file, so keep that in mind.</p><p>A little while later, I had a one-stop shop for resources pertaining to a few of the Super Mario games that I've played over the years. Now, whenever I can't remember how to get past Bowser, I can just pull up NotebookLM and ask.</p><p>I know that this took a bit of a left turn, considering my original goal, but the overall point is to demonstrate that AI tools can be useful in ways you might not have considered. I don't even know where the idea to create these guides came from, but I'm sure glad it came to me.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jnZqAebkN3a5RYxeNQCczA" name="notebooklm-galaxy-z-fold-6-super-mario-bros-3-switch-2-alt" alt="NotebookLM app with self-created Notebook about Super Mario games in front of Switch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jnZqAebkN3a5RYxeNQCczA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No, you aren't able to use it <em>while</em> you're playing like you can with Gemini or ChatGPT. But I have to wonder whether that functionality will be implemented in the near future. I'd really love it if there were a way to create a Gem or GPT that could be used with Gemini Live, but used NotebookLM as the source.</p><p>Nevertheless, who knows what these companies are going to bring next? Maybe something else will come along that takes all of this to the next level, and we just don't know it yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Among the improvements and upgrades are a few features that seem, well, <em>inspired</em> by Android and Wear OS. In some cases, Apple didn't even bother to change the name of the feature they copied from Google and Samsung.</p><p>It's always satisfying to watch Apple give iPhone users features that people who daily drive the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> have been using for years. If that's right up your alley, the WWDC 2025 keynote didn't disappoint. Apple "borrowed" a few ideas from fan-favorite Android tools like Gemini Live, Circle to Search, and many more. Let's recap all the ways iOS 26 and watchOS 26 copied <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> at WWDC this year.</p><h2 id="visual-intelligence-looks-a-lot-like-gemini-live-and-circle-to-search-2">Visual Intelligence looks a lot like Gemini Live and Circle to Search</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uzjKuN8SDZSbVi5ffc5Ynm" name="Visual-Intelligence-Search-Screen" alt="Three sample screens using Visual Intelligence in iOS 26." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uzjKuN8SDZSbVi5ffc5Ynm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Visual Intelligence is Apple's version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live with live video streaming</a>, and it's actually available now with iOS 18. However, the feature is limited to camera usage and can't access a user's iPhone screen. That's changing with iOS 26. Visual Intelligence will be able to view what's on a user's iPhone screen and take actions on their behalf. It can find items online or add an event to their calendar based the contents of their screen.</p><p>Sound familiar? It should, because it's exactly what Android already offers with Gemini Live's screen sharing feature and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. For well over a year, Android users have been able to circle a portion of their screen and learn more about it. For months, they've been able to share their entire screen with Gemini Live and have a natural-language conversation about it.</p><p>The real kicker is that iPhone users have been able to access these same features via the Google Chrome and Gemini apps on iOS. No matter which way you look at it, Google was first, and Apple is only now planning to add these capabilities to iPhone with iOS 26.</p><h2 id="imessage-backgrounds-are-clearly-whatsapp-inspired-2">iMessage backgrounds are clearly WhatsApp-inspired</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2jhQnTERZPtSi8ts9p5kcT" name="iOS-26-iMessage-Backgrounds" alt="iMessage backgrounds in iOS 26." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2jhQnTERZPtSi8ts9p5kcT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tell an iPhone user to download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>, and you might get some pushback. Well, that's going to get harder for iOS fans to justify, because iMessage just stole a popular WhatsApp feature. With iOS 26, users can set custom backgrounds for their iMessage conversations. The app will also let users generate custom backgrounds with AI using Image Playground. To note, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.coolest-gadgets.com/whatsapp-statistics/">73% of WhatsApp users</a> are on Android phones.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-introduces-chat-themes-and-new-backgrounds">WhatsApp has offered chat themes and wallpapers</a> for chats on iOS and Android for years.

Apple is quite literally adding features to iOS 26 that Google Pixel users have had for half a decade.</p><h2 id="liquid-glass-is-the-antithesis-of-material-3-expressive-2">Liquid Glass is the antithesis of Material 3 Expressive</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fbVNgLv97qCCyqqXmFQaob" name="iOS-26-Liquid-Glass" alt="The Liquid Glass design style in iOS 26." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fbVNgLv97qCCyqqXmFQaob.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Liquid Glass is the new design language for Apple's software products heading into 2026, including iOS 26. However, Apple wasn't the first to introduce a radical new user interface for mobile operating systems this year. Google did it earlier with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/gmails-new-material-3-expressive-design-is-secretly-hitting-some-inboxes">Material 3 Expressive</a>, a bright, bold, and colorful UI for Android 16 designed to meet users where they are. The company's studies showed that Material 3 Expressive isn't just good-looking, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">it's also easier to use</a>.</p><p>While no one would mistake iOS 26's Liquid Glass aesthetic for Android 16's Material 3 Expressive look, the timing is interesting. Apple is trying to achieve the same thing as Google with its new UI, but the two companies are just going about it in completely different ways. Still, Google gets a bit of credit for unveiling its vision for the future of mobile user-interface design before Apple.</p><h2 id="wrist-flick-is-just-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-s-shake-to-dismiss-2">Wrist flick is just the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's Shake to Dismiss</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SoXF4LBWy6orJWcxWdUHaE" name="watchOS-26-Wrist-Flick" alt="Wrist flick on an Apple Watch with watchOS 26." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SoXF4LBWy6orJWcxWdUHaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With watchOS 26, Apple is introducing a new way to dismiss Apple Watch notifications. Except, it's not actually that new. Samsung offers a similar tool on the Galaxy Watch 7 called Shake to Dismiss. It's technically more versatile than Apple's upcoming "wrist flick" tool, since the Galaxy Watch 7 version can also be used to dismiss other things, like alarms.</p><p>In fact, the gestures available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> can put its Apple Watch competitors to shame. In addition to Shake to Dismiss, you can also twist your wrist twice to decline an incoming phone call. While the wrist flick will probably come in handy for Apple Watch users, it's nothing new for Wear OS users.</p><h2 id="apple-maps-visited-places-is-a-google-maps-timeline-clone-2">Apple Maps' Visited Places is a Google Maps Timeline clone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ywecbRqA3P2HDCrmx72NW" name="Apple-Maps-Visited-Places" alt="Visited Places in the Apple Maps app on iOS 26." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ywecbRqA3P2HDCrmx72NW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another neat feature heading to iPhone users for the first time is Visited Places in Apple Maps. It'll remember the places you've visited with end-to-end encryption, using Apple Intelligence to identify habits and daily routes. For instance, you can see how many times you've visited your favorite restaurant or city.</p><p>It sounds interesting enough if you're an Apple Maps user, but Google Maps users have had this feature for years. It's called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-view-your-location-history-google-maps">Google Maps Timeline</a> on the other side of the walled garden, and Google describes it as "a personal map that helps you remember routes and trips you've taken and places you've been based on your Location History." On the Android side of things, it works with Android Auto, too.</p><h2 id="live-translation-only-changed-a-few-letters-from-live-translate-2">Live Translation only changed a few letters from Live Translate</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fz6hixxnjW3tPgFjrqbWHJ" name="Live-Translation-iOS-26" alt="Live Translation in iOS 26." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fz6hixxnjW3tPgFjrqbWHJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, Apple is giving iOS 26 users the ability to translate calls, messages, songs, and more in real-time. It's such a handy feature that Android users might be shocked to learn it wasn't <em>already</em> available on iPhone before WWDC 2025. Google and Samsung both have their own Live Translate features, with Galaxy phones able to translate 13 languages in real-time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-galaxy-s24-live-translate">with the Galaxy S24 and newer</a>.</p><p>It comes just after iOS 18 added support for setting Google Translate as your default translation app, which is interesting timing.</p><hr><p>Of course, there are a few things Google would be wise to steal from Apple. iPadOS 26 just keeps getting better, and at WWDC 2025 it gained macOS-like window management and productivity options. It's unlikely that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> will catch up to the iPad at this rate.</p><p>Still, it's always worth looking at which features Apple is only now adding to iOS 26 and watchOS 26, but Android and Wear OS users have been using for years.</p> ]]></dc:content>

They can track information I need but if they aren't accurate are they helping or hurting? I know you've talked about this in the past but have a few years made a big difference?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks!</strong></em></p><p>Hi Rhea, and thanks for sending in a great question. It's also an important one, especially for people with health concerns or fitness fanatics: Are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearable devices</a> accurate enough in 2025?</p><p>The easy answer is no. But that's not the <em>right</em> answer. Accuracy is important, but it's not the only data that can be insightful for your health, and wearables do a pretty good job at it, even if they aren't giving the perfect readings.</p><p>To be clear, I'm talking about the things a wearable tracks on its own, like heart rate, breathing, sleep patterns, or (coming soon?) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-has-patented-long-term-blood-glucose-tracking-heres-how-itd-work">blood glucose</a>. The things you have to enter yourself, like how many glasses of water you drank, are only as helpful as you make them. Cheating and saying you drank eight glasses of water instead of six is kind of silly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VatnJ6pY3P8DFtkU2FBDbi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-charging-case-09.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring and its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VatnJ6pY3P8DFtkU2FBDbi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's true that wearables don't give perfect readings. They're built using fairly cheap off-the-shelf sensors and calibrated to work for (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/big-and-black-heart-rate-monitors-fail">almost</a>) everyone, not to work perfectly until it's recalibration time. Nobody would buy a smartwatch that needed to go back every 90 days to be tested and ended up costing a couple of thousand dollars to be slightly more precise.</p><p>But they don't <em>need</em> to be exact to be helpful. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/when-it-comes-to-your-health-dont-place-too-much-trust-in-your-smartwatch"><em><strong>NEVER</strong></em> depend on a wearable device</a> to make any sort of diagnosis or determine if you have an emergency in the works. The companies making them will tell you the same — if your watch says you're heart seems fine but you don't <em>feel</em> fine, <strong>go to the emergency room</strong>. The opposite is true, too — if the watch says there is a problem, but you don't feel like there's a problem, get looked at anyway.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cabCsi8Y5Cvf6VmfGN7a5d" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-05.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring app sleep apnea monitoring feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cabCsi8Y5Cvf6VmfGN7a5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It sounds like I'm saying you shouldn't trust what you see from your watch, and that makes them seem unhelpful. That's half-right; don't fully trust what it tells you, but they can be very helpful because they have one thing going for them: consistency.</p><p>I've tested a smartwatch against actual medical equipment, and the results were different, even to the point that the watch didn't see a real problem. What I've found is that while the readings may not be fully accurate, they are great at showing trends</p><p>If your watch indicates that your heart rate is 20 bpm different from an actual monitor, but shows a 20 bpm difference each time your heart rate rises or drops, you will see a consistent trend. And so will your doctor.</p><p>I've even asked my doctor about this because I am a nerd. She told me that you can't get real-time clinical data from a watch or a ring, no matter the brand. However, you can review your history, and important information is readily available to help her. You aren't in her office hooked up to an EKG 24 hours a day, but you wear your watch whenever it's not charging. Those readings tell a story. That's why she wears one!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fiGThPdzWz8TGEYS9E52HB" name="google-pixel-watch-vs-pixel-watch-2-working-out-fitbit.jpg" alt="Comparing heart rate tracking on the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fiGThPdzWz8TGEYS9E52HB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I believe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">wearables play a crucial role in healthcare</a>, particularly for individuals who require additional support in this area.

Traveling with a toddler necessitates a lot of planning, and I'd like to think we're at a point where we have a decent handle on things. Our daughter is about to turn two later this month, and she's at the phase where she can identify colors and count to twenty, so she turns everything in her surroundings into a counting or color-based game.</p><p>Here’s what we’re packing while traveling with our toddler, whether it’s an extended vacation or a short visit to meet relatives.</p><h2 id="phones-and-tablets-2">Phones and tablets</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="QxwADzWCLs49NwySLGKmiS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra next to X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QxwADzWCLs49NwySLGKmiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We tend to go overboard while packing travel tech, and that's even more true with a toddler involved. We've done a decent job limiting screen use, but an iPad is a must-have when traveling; I download YouTube music videos ahead of time (she likes everything from grunge to heavy metal and Telugu songs), and have one cartoon available just to have some variety (she's keen on Pingu).</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D">11-inch iPad Air M3</a> is ideally suited for travel as it's smaller than the Pro models (we use the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 13-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> at home), and battery life is great.</p><p>Other than that, we have our phones. While I prefer foldables when going on press junkets, they're just not feasible with a toddler, so I take either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-XL-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HV78PT" target="_blank">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, and my wife has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a> as her daily driver. A key consideration in choosing phones is camera; both Vivo devices and the Pixel do a great job taking photos of fast-moving objects, and that's essential with a toddler.</p><h2 id="audio-and-cameras-2">Audio and cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o9USyGnftrhCtaFK86otTH" name="tribit-stormbox2-8.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox 2 with Pixel 9 Pro XL running Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o9USyGnftrhCtaFK86otTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most of the time, our toddler doesn't allow us to take photos and videos of her, and this is where having an action camera like DJI's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Standard-Waterproof-Stabilization-Touchscreens/dp/B0DBQTC2P7" target="_blank">Osmo Action 5 Pro</a> has proved invaluable. The camera is significantly smaller than a phone, it has a built-in viewfinder — at the front and back — and it takes good images and videos. While the caliber of photos doesn't match that of the X200 Ultra or X200 Pro, it allows us to capture moments that would be impossible with a phone.</p><p>I looked at kid-friendly headsets and earbuds, but most of the options lacked the same build quality as mainstream choices, so I opted for Creative's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5MPKXBQ">Zen Hybrid SXFI</a>. They're light enough that the heft isn't an issue, and they do a good job with noise isolation — something that comes in handy on a long-haul flight.</p><p>My wife and I use Bose these days; she has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-World-Class-Cancellation/dp/B0CD2FSRDD">QuietComfort Ultra earbuds</a>, and I use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489">QuietComfort Ultra headset</a>. Both products have standout noise isolation, highly customizable sound, and they're among the lightest in their categories; if anything, our toddler tends to use the Bose headset more than I (she's always interested in trying out products my wife and I are using).</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speaker</a> is useful to have as well. We take Tribit's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Bluetooth-Surround-Waterproof/dp/B0CW933QSJ">StormBox 2</a> as it is easy to pack and has good sound, doesn't weigh much, and comes with IPX7 water resistance. It's just easier to play songs than use an iPad while waiting at the lounge or gate, and the StormBox 2 can be easily attached to the outside of a bag.</p><h2 id="charging-and-accessories-2">Charging and accessories</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JaJGFGviGvhRUs2sc6CgBW" name="ugreen-nexode-power-bank-200w-13.jpg" alt="UGREEN Nexode 25000mAh Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JaJGFGviGvhRUs2sc6CgBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of that, we carry power banks; while I have 48,000mAh power banks at home, they're not designed for travel, so I turn to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-25000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHM5RY2">UGREEN Nexode 25,000mAh</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B0D3PL8XCL">Anker's 27,650mAh Prime</a> power banks. Both have vertical designs and are easy to slot into a bag, and they do a good job of charging all of our gear on the go. I've had both power banks for the better part of a year now, and they've been reliable.</p><p>I also take an external SSD that contains videos, cartoons, and enough storage to transfer data from the action camera or phones. I'm partial to Seagate's 2TB<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Portable-Resistant-Compatibility-STMX2000400-PC/dp/B0DJ9K1QSY"> Ultra Compact SSD</a> as it is smaller than most other options, and it has a rugged design alongside USB-C connectivity.</p><h2 id="travel-gear-and-luggage-2">Travel gear and luggage</h2><p>We like traveling with tech bags, but they're limited in the amount of things they hold — if you're traveling with a toddler, you'll need to carry a lot of stuff. So we use a duffel; the current go-to choice is Bellroy's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bellroy-Venture-Duffel-55L-weekend/dp/B0D3FTZVLD"> 55L Venture Duffel</a>. It opens wide, stores everything we need with relative ease, and has several carry modes — it can be used over-the-shoulder, as a cross-body, or as a standard duffel thanks to the grab handles.</p><p>We use the duffel to store baby essentials, toys, and food (in individual packing cubes), and have a change of clothing for everyone as well. We also pack at least five board books (she loves to read), and my wife recently bought a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Montessori-Toddlers-Educational-Preschool-Activity/dp/B0992B1LYN" target="_blank"> busy book</a>, which has so many different activities that it's an effortless way to entertain a toddler on a flight.</p><p>I use Bellroy's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.amazon.com/Bellroy-Transit-Travel-backpack-protection/dp/B0F1FBLH2Z"> Transit Travel Pack Pro</a> as my tech bag, and it's fantastic; it stores all the tech I take without any issues, and it has enough mesh pockets and cubbies to slot in all my accessories. My wife recently started using the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.matadorequipment.com/products/globerider35-travel-backpack" target="_blank"> Matador GlobeRider35</a>, and the 35L size is ideal for carrying the rest of our tech and accessories. It features two main compartments, numerous storage pockets, and a clamshell design that makes packing even easier.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's exactly what all Enabot pet robots are designed to do.</p><p>Enabot offers a wide range of wheeled mobile robots, starting with the affordable EBO SE, which costs just $130, and progressing to the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/enabot-ebo-x-review" target="_blank">EBO X</a>, priced at a whopping $1,000 and featuring cool extras like Alexa built-in and Harmon Kardon speakers. Then there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/enabot-rolapet-petpal-hands-on">RolaPet PetPal</a>, which comes with modular extensions like a food compartment and toys.</p><p>I highly recommend getting one of these pet robots to be able to communicate and interact with your fluffy loved ones when on holiday. It's worth every penny.</p><h2 id="automate-food-and-water-delivery-2">Automate food and water delivery</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fwmvDyKHrHja8K84U9h6d7" name="rojeco-automatic-cat-and-dog-feeder" alt="ROJECO Automatic Cat & Dog Feeder" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fwmvDyKHrHja8K84U9h6d7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if you have a pet sitter or a friend coming in to take care of your pets, it's always a good idea to have a backup plan. Automate the food and water delivery aspect of your pet's daily routine using affordable accessories, such as smart pet feeders and water fountains. This also makes your pet's caretaker's life easier, which is a nice bonus.</p><p>I don't use the fanciest, most expensive pet feeder. In fact, no one needs to spend more than a few bucks to get a decent smart pet feeder. The one I use is from a brand called ROJECO. It costs less than $50 and comes with a camera, night vision, backup battery support, a companion app, a steel tray, a mic, a speaker, and a huge food storage compartment.</p><p>All I needed to buy in addition to this handy pet feeder were a couple of D batteries, which serve as a backup power source in case the main AC power goes out. This alone makes this $40 automatic cat and dog feeder a stellar purchase.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zT6423JNzsQbV6MrU8qhjP" name="enabot-rola-smart-pet-water-fountain" alt="Enabot ROLA Smart Pet Water Fountain" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zT6423JNzsQbV6MrU8qhjP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you have cats, a water fountain is a great way to encourage them to drink more water. Unlike solid food, it is tough to monitor their water intake when you're not home for a while. That's where a decent water fountain comes into play.</p><p>There are two excellent options when considering one of these. You can choose either a wired or wireless variant. Any decent water fountain with a cleansing filter should do the job. Stainless steel water fountains are cleaner than plastic ones. Make sure you change the filter regularly and maintain hygiene standards to keep the water fresh.</p><p>I recommend the Enabot ROLA Smart Pet Water Fountain as it is only $50, battery-operated, stainless steel, and has a comprehensive companion app that offers in-depth hydration-related health-tracking features. You don't even have to worry about changing the filter, as the app sends you a reminder automatically when it's time. It charges wirelessly and has backup batteries, plus you get 60 days of uptime on a single charge.</p><p>On top of that, you get ecosystem benefits when using multiple Enabot devices together, such as the pet robot and water fountain.</p><h2 id="number-two-should-be-your-number-one-concern-2">Number two should be your number one concern</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VqxkfqZRfBw8JNgd4QxXdd" name="petpivot-autoscooper-11" alt="PetPivot Autoscooper 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqxkfqZRfBw8JNgd4QxXdd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Poop management is tough, but thankfully there are plenty of smart cat litter boxes around that can simplify this for you. For my dog owners, I'm sorry that there's no such shortcut available. Since our canine companions require frequent walks, you should not be thinking about this option anyway, though.</p><p>Once again, you have an ocean of options to pick from, but I recommend getting something simple. The PetPivot Autoscooper 11 is a great pick as it costs $200, which is a budget-friendly price for a smart cat litter box. The brand includes one roll of 10L trash bags and a litter-trapping mat in the box. Remember, the simpler the tool, the easier it is to take care of in the long run.</p><p>It takes less than 10 minutes to have the Autoscooper 11 unboxed, set up, and running. The setup process is so darn easy — I can't emphasize this enough.</p><p>Once your cat's potty business is taken care of, you'll find it so much easier to take that trip to Bali. It'll be so much easier for someone else to drop by and take care of your cat. The Autoscooper 11 is fantastic for emergencies or even daily use, because one button takes care of cleaning the litter box. All you have to do is take out the trash bag every few days, depending on how many cats you have and how much they defecate.</p><hr><h2 id="enjoy-your-holiday-2">Enjoy your holiday!</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9edZHtJi4nvZSREsbTLb6V" name="cat-vacation-hearts-meme" alt="Pets and vacation meme" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9edZHtJi4nvZSREsbTLb6V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's so much more you can buy, but these are the absolute essentials.

Strings of code in the developer preview show hints at features that Google has yet to reveal, and they all sound useful to the upcoming Pixel Watch 4!</p><p>Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wear-os-6-adaptive-charging-leak-3565102/">Android Authority</a> spotted strings of code in the ClockworkSysUiGoogle app for adaptive charging. It would stop at a set percentage — likely 80%, as on Pixel phones — and show "Charging will be completed by X" on the display, with an option to "Override" and show "Charging to full now."</p><p>During my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-tested-early-wear-os-6-build-on-pixel-watch-3-at-google-io-2025">Wear OS 6 hands-on at I/O</a>, I spotted the full-charge screen above, and "Ready to go!" is one of the code strings Rahman spotted. So I fully believe this feature is coming. It'll pair well with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-fully-charged-notifications-are-finally-rolling-out-widely">"fully charged" notifications</a> Google added last year.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/it-looks-like-samsung-isnt-holding-anything-back-for-one-ui-8-watch-and-im-pumped">Galaxy Watch 8 code leaks</a> also revealed an adaptive charging tool that lets you choose a custom max percentage, so we can reasonably expect this tool across devices when Wear OS 6 arrives in late summer or early fall.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Ywq6u4SwGvBYS9VFqioWtd" name="Pixel-Watch-3-unlock-Pixel-9" alt="The Pixel Watch 3 with the screen "Pixel 9 Unlocked by this watch" and a "Lock" option, worn on a wrist hovering above the Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ywq6u4SwGvBYS9VFqioWtd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Imagine the opposite of this feature </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rahman spotted another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wear-os-6-water-lock-shortcut-leak-3565051/">dev preview code string</a> for a Water Lock feature on Pixel Watches, but it's unclear how different this would be from the current "Touch Lock" that prevents false inputs on the display and disables the rotating crown while you're swimming or in the shower.

However, leaks of its next flagship seem to be showing up as well. The most recent leak focuses on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>, specifically discussing the purported battery capacity and charging speeds of the phone.</p><p>The information comes from prominent tipster PandaFlash on X, when he was asked about the specs of the upcoming Galaxy S26 Ultra. A user mentioned that they were looking to upgrade their device to the Galaxy S26 Ultra when it launches, explaining what they'd want the device to come with and inquiring about the possibility of a 5,500mAh battery capacity (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/galaxy-s26-ultra-may-fall-behind-in-battery-and-charging-again/">Sammy Guru</a>).</p><p>PandaFlash stated that the battery capacity of the device hasn't been finalized by the company yet; however, if they plan to increase the battery capacity, it will still remain under 5,400 mAh.</p><p>The current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> comes with a 5,000mAh battery, which lasts for an entire day or sometimes even more based on usage patterns. According to Andrew Myrick, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's battery is as good as it gets. "Not once did I find myself needing to pop the phone on the charger just to give me a few extra minutes of doom-scrolling social media," he added in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-battery-life-and-charging">review</a>.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battery Capacity is not Final yet but Under 5400mAh "if" they Increase, Charging Speed not 65w, 120Hz Refresh Rate, No Under Display Camera.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1931749115072811232">June 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>That said, despite the battery being exceptional, the Galaxy S25 Ultra was left with 45W wired charging speeds, which is very 2019 of Samsung. And it looks like they might retain the same speeds on the next device as well. PandaFlash added that the company won't give the device 65W of charging speeds that we expect, but will keep it anywhere between 45W and 50W.</p><p>"Samsung is still undecided about using Silicon Carbon Battery in the Galaxy S26 Series," they added.</p><p>Currently, Samsung utilizes Li-Ion batteries, and there have been rumors suggesting that the company could switch to denser silicon-carbon batteries, which can withstand extreme temperatures, last longer, and charge faster. However, there was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sus-battery-tech-galaxy-s26-rumors">some recent chatter</a> that Samsung might look toward a different material, known as "SUS CAN," that will finally provide stronger, longer-lasting batteries.</p><p>Furthermore, the tipster adds that the Galaxy S26 Ultra's screen could get a 120Hz refresh rate, and no under-display camera. Other rumors suggest that the Galaxy S26 Ultra may feature a slimmer camera bump compared to its predecessor, as the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-trying-to-make-the-galaxy-s26-ultra-thinner-with-new-camera-lenses" target="_blank">reportedly</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-trying-to-make-the-galaxy-s26-ultra-thinner-with-new-camera-lenses"> using</a> an "inkjet printing process" to print thinner camera lenses, replacing the bulky traditional ones.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It is on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bellroy-Transit-Travel-backpack-protection/dp/B0F1FBLH2Z">costlier end of the scale at $339</a>, but it has everything I need in a tech bag. It has plenty of storage and 11 pockets in total, providing comfortable storage for all my tech accessories — an enclosed water bottle pocket, an RFID-blocking pocket, and a padded section that slots in my MagicBook Pro 16 without any issues.</p><p>In addition to the Bellroy bag, I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Travel-Duffel-Black/dp/B0D4DVS1C6">Peak Design’s Travel Duffel</a> when going on extended junkets. The duffel has durable build quality, plenty of mesh pockets, and it easily accommodates the brand's packing cubes. The 65L variant I'm using is honestly overkill, and the 45L model should be more than adequate in most situations.</p><p>I always have a few external drives on hand while traveling.

It's just so much more convenient to use an action camera than a phone, and the Action 5 Pro boasts a durable design that captures fantastic footage in challenging situations.</p><p>Other accessories include Rolling Square's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Rolling-Square-inCharge-Universal-Eco-Friendly/dp/B0DQQ8SD9P">inCharge XS cable</a>, which features USB-C, Lightning, and USB-A connectivity, and charges at 240W. It's the ideal travel charging cable, and the best part is that it features magnets on either end, allowing you to simply attach it to a key ring.</p><p>Another accessory I'm liking quite a bit is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Rolling-Square-Aircard-Bluetooth-Compatibility/dp/B0C8NHVW7L">AirCard</a>, a credit card-sized Bluetooth tracker that works with both iPhones and Android devices (using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/find-my-device-is-out-googles-new-find-hub-is-officially-in">new Find Hub</a>), and it goes in the tech bag.

I want to keep myself accountable for the steps I take and my body’s energy levels, while also ensuring that the jet lag isn’t overwhelming me too much.</p><p>I also enjoy wearing my Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which offer both sun protection and a convenient option for quick, candid photos of my surroundings.</p><h2 id="brady-snyder-2">Brady Snyder</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mDSEKVDASzpTnwDYdE5P9S" name="Peak-Design-Roller-Pro" alt="The Peak Design Roller Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDSEKVDASzpTnwDYdE5P9S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Peak Design)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a bunch of tech-focused suitcases and carry-on bags out there, and they’re all mostly garbage. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.peakdesign.com/pages/roller-pro">Peak Design Roller Pro</a> carry-on is a notable exception. It has a front pocket with a laptop or tablet sleeve and room for essentials. On the inside, you can fit modular Peak Design camera cubes or packing cubes. I’ve brought entire desktop PC setups cross-country using this carry-on, and can vouch for it as a tech-first suitcase.</p><p>A passport wallet is a travel essential, but which one should you buy? My vote goes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/passport-wallet">Nomad Passport Wallet</a>, specifically the version with an integrated pen. If you’ve ever traveled internationally, having to fill out customs declarations and other forms without a pen is such a hassle. With this wallet, you don’t have to worry about it. You also have plenty of room for cards, Find Hub trackers, and a magnetic spot for a paper boarding pass.</p><h2 id="namerah-saud-fatmi-2">Namerah Saud Fatmi</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aEQ469BZjupJemy773m7iC" name="Casefity-Bounce-suitcase" alt="Black Casetify Bounce suitcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aEQ469BZjupJemy773m7iC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Casetify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>CASETiFY is one of the largest and most reputable smartphone case manufacturers in the world.

These days, my main charger is UGREEN's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC">160W Nexode Pro</a>. It has three USB-C ports alongside one USB-A, and it does a great job of charging all my devices.</p><p>The other charger is an Arsmel travel plug. This is essentially a travel plug that doubles as a 170W GaN charger, and it's fabulous. Most of the hotels I stay at have U.S.-style blade plugs, but if there's ever a situation where they're not present, as was the case in Barcelona, the Arsmel travel charger is useful.</p><p>I have over two dozen power banks, and the one I use these days is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B0D3PK2JQ8/">Anker Prime 27,650mAh</a>. It has a total power budget of 250W, does a good job charging just about any device, including OnePlus and Vivo phones, and it has a reliable design. After six months of extensive use in four different countries, the Prime power bank remains strong, and it is one of the most straightforward recommendations I can make.</p><p>The other power bank is the Baseus PicoGo. This is a compact 10,000mAh magnetic power bank that attaches to the back of my phone. The smaller size makes it easier to carry while I'm out and about. I predominantly use two UGREEN 240W USB-C to USB-C charging cables to connect my phones and accessories to the power banks, and they've been reliable.</p><h2 id="michael-hicks-anker-737-insignia-surge-protector-strip-2">Michael Hicks: Anker 737, Insignia surge protector strip</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="4d5aa2YQq3chqYt8UNdkKk" name="Anker 737 GaNPrime 140W Power Bank lifestyle.jpg" alt="Anker 737 GaNPrime 140W Power Bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4d5aa2YQq3chqYt8UNdkKk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1333" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anker)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I bought my Anker 737 24,000mAh Power Bank because it’s just small enough to fit in a carry-on, yet can provide my Steam Deck or MacBook with a decent amount of emergency juice on the plane. Anything smaller will work for a phone, but not for much else.</p><p>Frankly, unless I’m camping, I’ll find a way to squeeze my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-4-outlet-3-usb-1200-joules-surge-protector-strip-white/6420183.p?skuId=6420183">Insignia surge protector strip with 3 USB ports</a> into my luggage, because it’s easier to charge all my devices at one outlet than try to find several convenient ones in a hotel room. It’s not travel-sized, but I’m prioritizing convenience!</p><h2 id="brady-snyder-ugreen-25-000mah-power-bank-2">Brady Snyder: UGREEN 25,000mAh power bank </h2><p>I’ve tested dozens of power banks and portable chargers, but the UGREEN 25,000mAh power bank has been a staple in my travel and everyday carry kit for years. It simply gets everything right, from capacity to form factor to features. The power bank isn’t humongous — I can fit it in the back pocket of my jeans or a small fanny pack — but it offers enough juice to charge a laptop or your phone multiple times over. When I carry this charging accessory, I never have to worry about using my phone or other devices too much.</p><p>I also never travel without an Anker Nano wall adapter and a braided USB-C cable in my pocket. The combo is small and light enough to fit securely in airplane power outlets without falling out.</p><h2 id="namerah-saud-fatmi-zendure-anker-baseus-trio-2">Namerah Saud Fatmi: Zendure, Anker, Baseus trio</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B3Au7JKZG2fqp5gHx3LnfG" name="baseus-100w-retractable-3.jpg" alt="Baseus USB-C to USB-C 100W Retractable Cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B3Au7JKZG2fqp5gHx3LnfG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are three charging accessories I swear by when traveling. Save this formula for your own needs when traveling, as this combo alone will save you hours of annoyance and irritation, trust me.</p><p>My go-to power bank is the Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 165W, Built-In and Retractable Cables) because of its compact size, high capacity, fast charging speed, and conveniently built-in cable. I like to pair this with my trusty Zendure Passport III 65W GaN travel adapter, which has literally traveled across the world with me, and my favorite USB-C cord from Baseus.</p><p>It might sound silly to have a favorite cable, but this wire is nylon-braided, super long and durable, and it supports 100W charging, so I can use it with any device with zero anxiety. You can swap the models to your liking, but the formula is the key here.</p><h2 id="nandika-iyer-ravi-anker-nano-65w-charger-2">Nandika Iyer Ravi: Anker Nano 65W charger</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1366px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="nXzKDBcZZXQL94jBqAHZYh" name="anker-nano-ii-lifestyle-1_0.jpg" alt="Anker Nano Ii Lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nXzKDBcZZXQL94jBqAHZYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1366" height="768" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anker)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For keeping all my devices powered up on the go, especially during cross-country flights, my Anker USB power adapter is an absolute lifesaver.

The AirPods Max are not the most comfortable, the best sounding, or the best value. However, they do the absolute best job of blocking out airplane noise and turbulence out of any pair of over-ears I’ve tested. Although I’ve tried to switch to more comfortable options like the Sonos Ace or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/dyson-ontrac-review">Dyson OnTrac</a>, their ANC capabilities leave me reaching for my AirPods Max on a flight.</p><p>As someone whose ears are extremely sensitive to turbulence and elevation, I’d buy the $550 AirPods Max again just for the handful of plane trips I take each year.</p><h2 id="namerah-saud-fatmi-marshall-monitor-iii-anc-2">Namerah Saud Fatmi: Marshall Monitor III ANC</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MrQT7WhavCxCrVvuUzgNCY" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MrQT7WhavCxCrVvuUzgNCY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/marshall-monitor-iii-review">Marshall Monitor III</a> ANC headphones were my best friend when flying. Not only is the 70-hour battery life incredulously long, but the noise cancellation is on another level, and the wear experience is supremely comfortable. I have high sensory issues with sound, and the ANC on this pair really helped soothe my nerves during takeoff, in-flight turbulence, and landing.</p><p>Once you’ve charged these bad boys, you won’t have to undertake the chore again for a good three to four days with medium usage. Additionally, a quick 15-minute charge provides enough power for 12 hours of playback. There’s a customizable shortcut button that opens Spotify, and a knob that adds pause/play, track changing, and volume controls. I also appreciate that the physical buttons are seamlessly integrated into the headset, blending naturally into the design rather than protruding oddly or uncomfortably.</p><h2 id="nandika-iyer-ravi-apple-airpods-2">Nandika Iyer Ravi: Apple Airpods</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HgHHmmTriU7n4xJPpsAakS" name="AirPods-2nd-gen" alt="Apple AirPods 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HgHHmmTriU7n4xJPpsAakS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1120" height="630" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I travel, I prefer to pack light and keep things simple, especially now with a baby.

This device is critical because it can be your gateway for watching things you've chosen to download on your flight, or maybe it's what you use to read something. It is also incredibly handy to do any research or work while you're travelling (should that be the case!).</p><p>Here's everything the team has to say about their picks and which laptop or tablet they're travelling with.</p><h2 id="shruti-shekar-macbook-air-2022-2">Shruti Shekar: MacBook Air 2022</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zMwMZenRYBJNemUjUY86Dg" name="2022-apple-macbook-air-imore.jpg" alt="MacBook Air M2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zMwMZenRYBJNemUjUY86Dg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: iMore / Gerald Lynch)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll be honest, I've been a MacBook user since my first year of university, and that was 18 years ago. I have never really used other laptops or tablets unless it was a Mac. And I rarely use a tablet. So my choice of laptop for travel is usually my MacBook Air 2022. It's reliable, I use it to browse and if I need to do work it's all there. I keep it pretty simple with this device.</p><h2 id="derrek-lee-asus-zenbook-pro-14-oled-2">Derrek Lee: ASUS ZenBook Pro 14 OLED</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hjUwkwSkZechBpbgH9BBrE" name="ASUS-Zenbook-Pro-14-OLED.jpg" alt="The ASUS Zenbook Pro 14 OLED open and closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjUwkwSkZechBpbgH9BBrE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1527" height="859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: ASUS)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although I have a Chromebook, I actually prefer using Windows, and the ASUS ZenBook 14 Pro OLED is a great option to have on the go. It may not be the lightest, but for the kind of work I have to do, which sometimes involves editing videos or photos, this is more than up to the task. It's very powerful, runs Windows 11, and has a vibrant OLED display. Additionally, the trackpad features a built-in dial for adjusting color, changing volume, scrubbing videos, and more.</p><p>And because it's Windows, it works very well with Android thanks to apps like Link to Windows or Motorola's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a>.</p><h2 id="jerry-hildenbrand-google-pixelbook-go-2">Jerry Hildenbrand: Google Pixelbook Go</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7vzqdyde6tJsfSLTMysNHh" name="pixelbook-go-review-hero-169.jpg" alt="Google Pixelbook Go outside showing the Android Central website" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7vzqdyde6tJsfSLTMysNHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have “better” Chromebooks here, but the one I like the most, especially while traveling, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixelbook-go-still-chromebook-i-would-buy-today">Pixelbook Go</a>.

Then pair it with the Legion Tab or iPad Pro if there's enough time to watch YouTube or catch up on my list of backlogged shows and movies.</p><p>However, if I'm going to be gone for longer than a day or two, then all bets are off. I'll more than likely bring my MacBook Pro along with whatever else tickles my fancy at the time.</p><h2 id="harish-jonnalagadda-honor-magicbook-pro-16-2">Harish Jonnalagadda: Honor MagicBook Pro 16</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2794px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="nxZajt4tdRSeLj5hnTcCDf" name="Honor-Magicbook-Pro-16" alt="Render of the Honor MagicBook Pro 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nxZajt4tdRSeLj5hnTcCDf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2794" height="1571" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I started attending events again after a five-year hiatus, and it has been enjoyable to travel once more. I have a custom gaming rig powered by the RTX 5090 at home, and since I don't need to do any gaming on the road, I opted for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/honor-magicbook-pro-16-looks-good-and-rocks-an-rtx-4060-as-the-companys-first-ai-pc">Honor MagicBook Pro 16</a> as my travel choice. This is a beast of a Windows 11 notebook, featuring an aluminum design, a 16-inch 2K panel (3072 x 1920) with a 165Hz refresh rate, an Intel Core Ultra 5 platform, 24GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD.</p><p>The 75Wh battery easily lasts all day without any problems, and it has two USB-C ports. Honor leads the industry in eye protection technology, and the MagicBook 16 Pro features some of the same capabilities as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro.</a> The built-in keys are decent enough, and they have backlighting. Essentially, the MagicBook Pro 16 does everything I need in a travel-focused notebook, and at 4 pounds (1.83 kg), it is sufficiently lightweight to carry around all day in my bag.</p><h2 id="michael-hicks-galaxy-tab-s8-plus-macbook-pro-14-2">Michael Hicks: Galaxy Tab S8 Plus, MacBook Pro 14"</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sT7rUdJExhigSetXjgTzkm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S8-Plus-art.jpeg" alt="A drawing app on the Galaxy Tab S8 Plus, with S Pen on attached keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sT7rUdJExhigSetXjgTzkm.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My 14-inch MacBook Pro is the furthest thing from being convenient for travel or very good for battery life. But at least it gets decently bright for outdoor use; even in the shade, a dim Chromebook screen will be miserable to use. Otherwise, I still use my three-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-plus-review">Galaxy Tab S8 Plus</a> as a convenient hotel room option for streaming and Android games. It’s admittedly a bit overpowered for that, but I appreciate how it’ll last for a long flight without having to worry about charging.</p><h2 id="brady-snyder-lenovo-yoga-book-9i-2">Brady Snyder: Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="g2PCZnuW8WCDezY9v5u8iM" name="Lenovo-Yoga-Book-9i-2024" alt="The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i with an image of a butterfly spanning across both displays" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g2PCZnuW8WCDezY9v5u8iM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While traveling, I love to bring along the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-yoga-book-9i-gen-9-review">Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</a>. For those unfamiliar, the Yoga Book 9i is a dual-screen touchscreen laptop that’s versatile enough for almost any situation. You can flip the displays around 360 degrees to use it like a laptop, like a tent, or like a tablet. On a plane, for example, you might use it in tablet mode to watch content or play games.</p><p>However, when you arrive at your destination, the Yoga Book 9i transforms into a dual-screen workstation, complete with an included stand, keyboard, and mouse. You can do more with a Yoga Book 9i than any other laptop on the market, and for some, it might eliminate the need to carry a tablet separately.</p><h2 id="namerah-saud-fatmi-asus-zenbook-flip-15-oled-2">Namerah Saud Fatmi: ASUS Zenbook Flip 15 OLED</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rUtC3vpGCLWcpDgo2t3hZG" name="ASUS-Zenbook-Flip-15-OLED" alt="The ASUS Zenbook Flip 15 OLED" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rUtC3vpGCLWcpDgo2t3hZG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3600" height="2025" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: ASUS)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I juggled between overpowered gaming laptops and ultra-portable Chromebooks for years, only to realize neither was a good fit for me on the go. After much trial and error, the perfect formula for my remote work needs while traveling presented itself to me in the form of a Windows 2-in-1 that comes with a stylus: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/asus-zenbook-pro-15-flip-oled">ASUS Zenbook Flip 15 OLED</a>.</p><p>Depending on your needs, you can pick a variant that has a suitably powerful graphics card and processor. This contortionist device is lightweight, charges via USB-C, and has a lovely touchscreen OLED screen. It’s ideal for a wide range of tasks, including editing photos and videos, watching content, reading documents, and running heavy-duty software.</p><p>I personally find that 15 inches is just nice and fits in all bags and carry-ons. You can slip it in and out of your baggage during airport security checks with ease, and because it uses USB-C charging, you don’t have to pack a separate charger. If money isn’t an object, I highly recommend getting the upgraded Zenbook Pro 15 Flip OLED, which has even beefier specs.</p><h2 id="nandika-iyer-ravi-microsoft-surface-laptop-3-2">Nandika Iyer Ravi: Microsoft Surface Laptop 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UxtXGug2hpcVP43Bq8zZNe" name="Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-3" alt="The Surface Laptop 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UxtXGug2hpcVP43Bq8zZNe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've been relying on my 13-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-laptop-3-13-review">Microsoft Surface Laptop 3</a> for over six years now, and its continued performance and design are a testament to its quality. It truly stands out as one of the sleekest and lightest laptops I've ever owned, weighing about 1.25 to 1.5 kg. This makes it incredibly useful when I need to carry my laptop during travel, easily slipping into my bag without adding unnecessary bulk.</p><p>The best part is the Alacantra keyboard that not only provides an aesthetic look to the laptop but also contributes to a great typing experience. Although it has been six years since I purchased the laptop, the battery life remains impressively long. It provides approximately 11 hours of battery life on a full charge and also supports fast Charging, capable of reaching 80% charge in about an hour.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With the iPhone 16, you've got a good camera and a great battery.

Not only is this phone quite powerful, but it also has a great set of cameras, and the flip phone form factor makes it very pocketable, which is especially perfect when you're on the go or on a run.</p><p>It's also great for social media, thanks to features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/first-things-to-do-with-the-motorola-razr-2025-series">Camcorder mode</a> and the sturdy hinge that acts as a tripod, so you can record all your aesthetic TikToks with ease during your travels.</p><h2 id="jerry-hildenbrand-google-pixel-8a-2">Jerry Hildenbrand: Google Pixel 8a</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5057px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R" name="google-pixel-8a-blue-with-flowers-03.jpg" alt="The blue Google Pixel 8a on a tea tray with blue hydrangeas above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5057" height="2848" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To me, the best phone I can use while travelling is one I won’t miss as much if it gets lost or stolen.

Unfolded, it’s just 4.35mm thin, making even the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> look a bit bulky.</p><p>Even folded, the phone feels no thicker than a normal smartphone — it’s 3 entire millimeters thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> — yet features a screen that’s easy to use one-handed on the outside and a near-tablet-sized screen on the inside.

The tri-folding design allows you to use it as a regular phone, a traditional fold-out device like the Find N5, or you can unfurl it into a tablet-sized 10.2-inch panel. The OLED panel boasts outstanding colors and is incredibly thin. It is heavier than regular phones, but it isn't anywhere as unwieldy as I'd imagine when looking at the renders.</p><p>Installing the Play Store was straightforward, and once that was set up, I got Gmail, Chrome, and all the other utilities I rely on daily without any hassle. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei/huawei-mate-xt-camera-review">The cameras</a> are much better than I thought; it has a distinct edge over other foldables. While I was initially hesitant to use it because of the smaller 5,600mAh battery, the Mate XT consistently lasts all day, even when I'm on the road.</p><h2 id="michael-hick-google-pixel-9a-2">Michael Hick: Google Pixel 9a</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RmhKaE9hxduqUEEf9JcCSE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a home page against red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RmhKaE9hxduqUEEf9JcCSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> battery never quits on me, and that’s really important when you’re relying on cellular data. It’s not the thinnest Android phone due to its bulky 5,100mAh capacity, but the 6.3-inch display makes it easier to grip than your typical 6.8-inch flagship. The display itself gets bright enough to look decent on a sunny beach, and it takes far better photos than most mid-range phones.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's easy enough when you're at home and everything is within reach, but what about when you're out and about? If you didn't bring it along, you can't use it.

You know how it works by now.</p><p>More importantly (do not tell our boss!), we want to help. We are all Android nerds here on some level, and every one of us has been somewhere and needed something we didn't end up bringing along for the ride. Even with helpful guides, that can happen, so don't think it's just you.</p><p>We want you to have what you need when you need it. That means having the right stuff and not wasting a bunch of time and money. We've used thousands of products and know what we think is best, and we're going to pass it along for you to check out.

Essentially, mobile users are receiving the ability to lean on Gemini for summaries and questions about documents you have saved in your account. Additionally, Gemini's "understanding" capabilities will undoubtedly fuel its usability and functionality when asking specific questions in your documents.</p><p>Google says users can apply Gemini's summaries to long documents, such as research papers, to "get the gist" of what's going on. Of course, Gemini is expected to find exactly what you're question is asking without a hitch. The post adds that Gemini can also "create the first draft of a launch plan" through simple instructions (prompt).</p><p>When in a doc, Google states users can tap the AI's starry icon at the top of the app to find actions like "summarize" and "suggest improvements" on Android. Alternatively, you can type in your own request, just like you can on a PC. Android devices running v8 or higher can utilize Gemini on the go.</p><p>Google states Gemini features like "help me write," "help me create," and its image generation abilities are still not available on Android.</p><h2 id="nothing-like-a-time-saver-2">Nothing like a Time-Saver</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:323px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:185.76%;"><img id="mEMk8TbMfBhNNyVyHLW3w8" name="google-docs-gemini-on-android-summaries-more" alt="A screenshot of an Android device summoning Gemini in Google Docs for its new summary capabilities and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mEMk8TbMfBhNNyVyHLW3w8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="323" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's important to note that this update is arriving for Google Workspace Business and Enterprise (Standard and Plus for both) users. Moreover, customers with Gemini Education, Education Premium will receive this Gemini update on Android in Docs. Those on the rapid release domain will begin receiving it today (June 9), while those on scheduled domains will see it starting on July 2.</p><p>Outside of Workspace, Gemini's official app on mobile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-app-scheduled-actions-automated-tasks-rollout">snagged a huge update</a> last week before the weekend. Users should begin noticing the patch that brings "Scheduled Actions" to Android. Reserved for Gemini Pro and Ultra subscribers, users can tell Gemini to perform an automated task at a certain time/day. As an example, you can tell Gemini that you want a morning news roundup at a certain time every day.</p><p>Gemin is also said to collect sports scores and deliver those to you, if you'd like. As this arrives, Google has placed a new scheduled actions settings page in the Gemini app. If you have recurring ones, they will appear there, as well as some "one-off" ones, in case you need to edit them.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Firstly, you're never guaranteed to find the right plugs that match your current primary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">USB-C charger</a>. And secondly, you have limited space when traveling so it's necessary to carry only one charger that works with all your tech.</p><p>This is why I suggest grabbing a travel adapter with multiple combinations of USB ports and a very high wattage so everything from your phone to your laptop can connect to it. If you're seeking the best USB adapter for travel, I've curated this guide based on these criteria.</p><h2 id="make-life-easier-with-these-versatile-travel-adapters-2">Make life easier with these versatile travel adapters</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="5a98555f-ee3d-4a69-873d-13f668240591">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYpTCW5FH3AKc7PhNkSQfF.jpg' alt="Epicka TA-105 Max Universal Travel Adapter GaN 75W Fast Charging"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Epicka TA-105 Max Universal Travel Adapter GaN 75W Fast Charging</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best overall</strong></em></p><p>Epicka delivers unbelievable value for money with this 75W GaN travel adapter.

Pick an option based on the number of devices you travel with. For instance, most folks take their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphone</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>, and laptop or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablet</a> with them when traveling. Let me break it down for you.</p><p>Depending on the nature of your travel, you may have additional accessories too, like power banks and audio gadgets. Things like power banks and audio accessories don't need a separate charging cable or charger from your phone if it's all USB-C. Most modern laptops support USB-C charging as well, but they need 65W or higher charging speeds.</p><p>If you carry your laptop, tablet, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> with you, I recommend getting a 65W or higher travel adapter. This enables you to charge all your tech at the maximum possible charging speed on the go without the need to bring along an additional charging brick. On the other hand, if you just carry your phone and some companion accessories, choose a cheaper travel adapter with a lower power rating. For instance, Google Pixel users don't need more than 35W on the go because their phones don't support anything faster anyway. On the other hand, OnePlus users need something a lot speedier.</p><p>In the end, 65W is the safest bet for anyone. Since the price difference isn't significant, you can simply get the Epicka TA-105 Max Universal Travel Adapter as it comes with 75W GaN fast charging. It has plenty of ports and prongs, and the high power rating means you can plug in multiple things in one go and still get the fastest charging speed on everything connected simultaneously. Epicka also provides a two-year warranty on its travel adapter, so you've got a safety net in case something goes wrong.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Not everyone requires the fastest Wi-Fi 6 speeds with 5G mmWave support. Most of us only need portable mobile hotspot devices for streaming videos and music, light work on the go, or navigational purposes.</p><p>That being said, anyone who wants the cream of the crop should purchase the Netgear Nighthawk M6 Pro, as long as money isn't an object. It has everything a user could want from a portable Wi-Fi hotspot: lightning-fast 5G mmWave speeds, 6GHz Wi-Fi support, a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port, and a generous 5,185mAh battery that should last you 13 hours.  It's the complete package, ships unlocked, and supports both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/att">AT&T</a>.</p><p>There are several significantly cheaper alternatives available if you're not prepared to spend that much cash on a mobile hotspot. The Franklin A50 is a really cheap option that works on AT&T. You can pay as little as $5 per month for this baby. If you want something unlocked, Netgear's more affordable Nighthawk M1 Mobile Hotspot Router (MR1100) is a solid pick that offers a great mix of specs for a low price.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The first kind is ideal for converting wired earbuds and headphones into wireless ones by plugging them into the Bluetooth headphone adapter. This is similar to the function of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-headphone-adapter">USB headphone adapters</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the second type acts as receivers to which you can connect your wireless Bluetooth headphones or Bluetooth devices like phones and computers to play audio. For example, you could use these on a plane to connect your wireless earbuds to the in-flight entertainment system. Alternatively, you can also use these to add Bluetooth functionality to cars and older sound systems and speakers.</p><p>No need to lose your mind over this if you can't comprehend it. The Anker Soundsync supports dual device connection and comes with both male and female audio ports. It also has a generous 12-hour battery life, volume buttons, a mic, USB-C charging, and all the necessary cables and converters in the box. The price tag is very reasonable, making this the best overall choice when buying a Bluetooth headphone adapter.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These VIPs will also get bumped to the top of your Favorites list with a special “VIP” tag.</p><p>Tapping on any VIP pulls up a detailed information card with everything from their birthday to any notes you’ve saved—all pulled straight from their Contacts profile.</p><p>This panel goes way beyond those options. You can ask a VIP to share their location, check their local weather and time, update their notes, and even get activity suggestions based on your shared interests.</p><h2 id="dnd-not-for-vips-2">DND? Not for VIPs</h2><p>Furthermore, calls and messages from your VIPs cut through Do Not Disturb, so you never miss what matters.</p><p>That said, Pixel VIPs isn’t its own app, so don’t go looking for it in your app drawer after the update. You’ll find it through the regular widget picker or right inside the Google Contacts app.</p><p>The Pixel VIPs update is showing up on Pixel devices running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> with the May 2025 patch. It’s missing on the Android 16 QPR1 Beta though, and trying to open its Play Store page there leads nowhere.</p><p>If you try hitting the Play Store link directly, you might just get lucky.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It is Samsung’s own in-house app built to go toe-to-toe with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">leading web browsers</a> on mobile. And the fact that it straight-up name-drops the Fold 7 and Flip 7 leaves zero doubt about which devices it’s meant for.</p><p>Here’s where it gets even weirder: that browser listing doesn’t show up at all on Galaxy devices running Android 15 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>. But if you’ve got a Galaxy S25 already rocking Android 16 and One UI 8, it shows up, albeit under a different name: “Samsung Internet Browser for One UI 8 beta.”</p><h2 id="new-features-teased-2">New features teased</h2><p>Despite the name switch, both versions have the same version number (28.0.2.43). The browser listing is still live on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.sec.android.app.sbrowser" target="_blank">Galaxy Store</a> as of now.

But that consistency clashes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-drops-a-swift-tease-for-a-potential-z-fold-ultra">growing buzz about major changes coming to the Z series</a>. While the names may be business as usual, they’re likely just the tip of the iceberg, hinting at bigger shakeups brewing for Samsung’s foldable line.</p><p>From what’s leaking around, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is shaping up to be crazy slim: expect it to be just 4.94mm thick when unfolded, way thinner than the Fold 6’s 5.6mm. It's interesting to see how going that thin might mess with battery life down the road.</p><p>Samsung’s early hints make it clear the next-gen foldables are coming soon. This feels like the first tease in a steady drip of official information, but we’re still waiting on the exact date for the Galaxy Unpacked reveal.</p><ul><li><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It is said to be buried under the Battery health settings right beneath the Charging optimization preference on the Pixel phone.

Replacement is recommended for aged batteries."</p><p>Primarily, the new software feature will be adjusting the battery's maximum voltage in stages that start at 200 charge cycles and eventually to 1000 charge cycles to help stabilize "battery performance and aging."</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:375px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:160.00%;"><img id="KxjFSqprgwQ7jbG5S7jtmY" name="Pixel-Battery-health-assistance-feature" alt="Pixel's Battery Health Assistance feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KxjFSqprgwQ7jbG5S7jtmY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="375" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug/ via TheSpAndroid)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:375px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:160.00%;"><img id="AZMEfSag3jgZdDiLWhLwkY" name="Pixel-Battery-health-assistance-feature" alt="Pixel's Battery Health Assistance feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZMEfSag3jgZdDiLWhLwkY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="375" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug/ via TheSpAndroid)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:375px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:160.00%;"><img id="48m98CpT2VUeaY6eVHwtmY" name="Pixel-Battery-health-assistance-feature" alt="Pixel's Battery Health Assistance feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/48m98CpT2VUeaY6eVHwtmY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="375" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug/ via TheSpAndroid)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As the battery ages, the feature will tune the phone charging speed per the adjusted battery capacity.

yank my phone out of my pocket and line up the viewfinder. I rarely take photographs during races when I'm focused on staying in the zone, but I ended up taking 22 photos and one finish-line video by the end.</p><p>San Jose is the farthest thing from a scenic course for good photos, but I wanted to test how these glasses performed before bringing them to, say, Big Sur or NYC.</p><p>I also streamed my Half Marathon playlist during the race to keep me motivated, but with my ears fully uncovered to hear anyone trying to pass me and courteously avoid stumbling into them. Since most races "highly discourage" or outright ban headphones, this is a real perk.</p><p>But wearing Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses during the race had its fair share of cons, too.</p><h2 id="my-three-main-issues-with-wearing-smart-glasses-during-a-race-2">My three main issues with wearing smart glasses during a race</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-close-up.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I tend not to wear my normal glasses during runs because I can see well enough that it's never felt worth buying a strap to avoid them sliding down my nose. With my 50g Ray-Bans, it's clear I'll need to buy and strap on this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/accessories/ARB0002STray-ban%20lanyard-/8056597950282">thick, dorky lanyard</a> before I try another race with them.</p><p>They stayed in place for maybe 400m, but once my nose got sweaty, they started slipping. If I pushed them up, I immediately felt the weight bouncing and jiggling on my nose bridge before they slid down again.</p><p>I kept them in place by keeping my head tilted slightly up like some snooty nobleman in a BBC period piece, but it did take me a bit out of the zone to feel so rigid. And even if I wore the lanyard and they stayed in place, I suspect they'd still bounce uncomfortably because of the weight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="NjqfQwqkz4bVz4FKeAvb4e" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-glasses-half-marathon-camera-sample-2" alt="A Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses camera sample at the San Jose Half Marathon showing the lead runners of the race in the far distance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NjqfQwqkz4bVz4FKeAvb4e.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My second problem is less dire: with no viewfinder, it's easy to forget in the moment that you need to get up close and personal with your Ray-Bans to get a clear photo. I would see something cool and snap a photo, only to later have to squint and zoom in just to remember what my subject was amidst the landscape.</p><p>In this photo, for example, I saw the lead runners finishing their out-and-back the other way and thought it'd be cool to capture them. But they're barely noticeable and blurry because I took the shot from way too far back.</p><p>The resolution is great for glasses, and the ultrawide effect recreates the feeling of standing in a memory rather than composing a photo. In particular, my video of the final sprint, which I can't embed here (sorry), looked startlingly smooth compared to how it felt in the moment.</p><p>The point being, I'm still glad I wore them. I can jog my memory of the course without having to pay $50 for photos of me panting past camerapeople. Next time, I'll know that I need to position myself <strong>right next</strong> to the subject first, or else the photo won't turn out well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The real deal-breaker, though, is battery life. I took my Ray-Bans out of the case about 15 minutes before the start and didn't use them until then. At that point, I streamed music and took 22 photos and one video throughout my 1 hour 54-minute race, plus one accidental Meta AI trigger. As I cooled down, I checked my battery life: 8%.</p><p>Meta estimates its glasses will last four hours with "moderate" use and the right conditions, including "100 videos or up to 500 photos per full charge."</p><p>Smart glasses struggle with battery life in cold weather, but I wouldn't call mid-60ºF cold. Streaming music was part of the problem, so maybe I could wear my Ray-Bans <em>and</em> earbuds for another race and use the glasses solely for photography. I also forgot to disable the "Hey Meta" wake word, which can cause a decent amount of idle drain.</p><p>The biggest issue, though, is simply that my glasses are nearly two years old, and the capacity is fading. And since it's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/ai-glasses/323557833356826/">not possible</a> to replace the battery inside your glasses" because it's soldered in, I'd have to spend $329 on another pair to get better longevity.</p><p>So if I ever wear these for a marathon, I have to accept that I'll only capture content for the first part of the race (unless I go from an average to Olympic-level runner).</p><h2 id="the-next-ray-ban-meta-glasses-need-some-kind-of-battery-revamp-2">The next Ray-Ban Meta glasses need SOME kind of battery revamp</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LnU9jbJ5AfN5hdoTrsrCSZ" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-half-marathon-test-finish" alt="The author wearing Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses and a finisher medal at the San Jose Half Marathon." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LnU9jbJ5AfN5hdoTrsrCSZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Both my glasses and I were running on empty by this point </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't like it when our phone or watch needs more charging after a few years, but we expect it.

It’s the same handy feature that’s been on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> for a while now.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a> launched in India with a new lock screen shortcut that jumps straight into Google Gemini. While the settings label it as "Digital Assistant from Google," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13s-gemini-lock-screen-shortcut-3564203/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>’s screenshot gives it away with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>’s unmistakable icon.</p><p>Gemini's lock screen shortcut made waves with the OnePlus 13s launch, but it turns out, it’s not just a 13s thing. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/06/oneplus-gemini-lockscreen-shortcut/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this feature has been around on other OnePlus phones, like the 13, for a while now.</p><h2 id="not-new-just-noticed-2">Not new, just noticed</h2><p>And it’s not even tied to the newest software — the OnePlus 13 it was spotted on was still running a February 1, 2025 security patch, as per the outlet.</p><p>Gemini has pretty much taken over as the go-to AI on Android, and it's everywhere. You can launch it with a long press of the power button or the classic "Hey Google" hotword, among others, making it super easy to tap into what it can do.</p><p>Sure, most modern <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> let you fire up Gemini with a voice command from the lock screen, but that’s just the basics. What makes the dedicated lock screen shortcut special is that it launches the full Gemini app, not just a new query. That means you can jump right back into past chats and pick up where you left off, which voice activation just doesn’t offer.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:396px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.17%;"><img id="UTT9SdoiJEeN4qqJRfoq7g" name="OnePlus-13s-Gemini-lockscreen-shortcut" alt="lockscreen shortcut for Gemini on the OnePlus 13s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTT9SdoiJEeN4qqJRfoq7g.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="396" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:396px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.17%;"><img id="ednhtXicoENmQUqk3PMk7g" name="OnePlus-13s-Gemini-lockscreen-shortcut" alt="lockscreen shortcut for Gemini on the OnePlus 13s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ednhtXicoENmQUqk3PMk7g.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="396" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It's worth noting that Samsung phones do let you add Gemini as a lockscreen shortcut, but there’s a catch — you usually still have to unlock your phone to actually use it. That means no jumping straight into your chats or full Gemini features without hitting a security screen first. So, the shortcut’s there, but it’s not the seamless, one-tap access you’d hope for.</p><p>The OnePlus 13s is exclusive in India and China, packed with smart features that go toe-to-toe with Samsung’s best. It’s got writing help, real-time call and message translation, and deep Gemini integration baked right into its core apps. But the real flex is a physical AI button and the Gemini lockscreen shortcut.</p><p>Beyond the slick shortcut, the OnePlus 13s is the first to roll out OnePlus’s newest AI features. That includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">OnePlus AI Mind</a>, a smart hub that keeps your screenshots, notes, and other bits easy to find later.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In my mind, this would open up a world of possibilities, in addition to being an easy way to access the host of AI features Motorola has packed into its Moto AI suite. However, the implementation leaves a lot to be desired, and frankly, the AI Key is often an afterthought when it easily could have been Motorola’s Action Button.</p><p>Its faults become even more apparent when we live in a world where AI is becoming more prevalent. Motorola’s implementation of it doesn’t really hold a candle to Google or Samsung, but it’s a decent first step. With that said, I think the AI Key is a great idea when done right, and both Google and Samsung would be insane not to consider implementing something like it in future phones.</p><h2 id="moto-ai-limitations-2">Moto AI limitations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ycdkR38ux8uZtf9BbP6sBW" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-Moto-AI-catch-me-up-01" alt="Moto AI running on a Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycdkR38ux8uZtf9BbP6sBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola is trying to put its own spin on AI, a strategy that includes its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> chatbot. You can think of it as a conversational, but somewhat less functional, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> or even Bixby. It can answer questions and respond in a fairly natural way, but it can’t really do much on the phone, which sort of defeats the purpose of having an AI assistant/chatbot. Moto AI is a decent offering, but it still pales in comparison to Google’s AI or Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p><p>On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>, you can customize the AI Key to trigger the Moto AI overlay with a long press. Unfortunately, that’s the <em>only </em>option for the long press, which feels like a glaring oversight. You can’t set it to another digital assistant, despite Motorola literally filling the Razr Ultra 2025 with various options. It’s just Moto AI or nothing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Okay, fine, so I’ll use Moto AI. No big deal. The problem then is that when I press the AI Key to trigger Moto AI, I have to <em>then </em>press the mic button to <em>talk </em>to Moto AI, which is <em>usually </em>the case. This differs from how Gemini functions when set to trigger using the power button or corner swipe of the display; it automatically starts listening to you. The fact that I have to press another button to talk to Moto AI adds another seemingly unnecessary step, which feels cumbersome.</p><p>This probably has something to do with Moto AI automatically analyzing what’s on your screen when you trigger it, which allows it to provide suggestions on what you should do. However, I don’t see why it can’t do that, and let me talk to it at the same time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xEfKGfryXxX5DRtQTPWaCW" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-Moto-AI-02" alt="Moto AI running on a Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xEfKGfryXxX5DRtQTPWaCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I activate Gemini with a YouTube video open, for example, it will know that I’m watching a video and populate options such as “Ask about video” or “Talk Live about video,” but I still have the option to begin speaking to it when triggered automatically. This alone makes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> much more accessible than, and why the “AI Key” should be expanded to just more than Motorola’s AI features.</p><p>On that note, the only other option when customizing the AI Key is a Double tap, which only lets you activate Catch Me Up and Remember This. Nothing else. Which means between a double press and or long press, you have a total of <em>three </em>functions available from the AI Key. It feels like a complete waste of hardware.</p><h2 id="samsung-was-on-the-right-track-2">Samsung was on the right track</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SPiiSqamYigAQx5GdrKWaQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S8-bixby-key" alt="The Bixby Key and volume buttons on the Galaxy S8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPiiSqamYigAQx5GdrKWaQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a while, Samsung phones used to include an additional Bixby Key, which at the time, felt like the company was trying to force Bixby on us. I remember not being a fan of the move, since I felt Bixby was always playing second fiddle to Google Assistant. However, as AI becomes more prevalent and capable, I wish Samsung hadn’t removed this button from its Galaxy phones and hope the company considers bringing it back.</p><p>The Bixby button may have been introduced as an easy way to access Bixby, but the company has given users at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-remap-bixby-button-your-galaxy-phone-launch-any-app">some level of built-in customization</a>. You could set one gesture, either a single tap or double tap, to open an app of your choice or trigger a Routine, while the other option would be used for Bixby.</p><p>What’s more is that users found ways to sideline Bixby completely by using third-party apps like Tasker, which made it possible to trigger Google Assistant instead. This is something I’ve looked into for the Razr Ultra 2025, but so far, I’ve not had much luck.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1582px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.23%;"><img id="wQW8YPQXvYPCKmseDAmuiK" name="bixby-remap-2.jpg" alt="Bixby Remap 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wQW8YPQXvYPCKmseDAmuiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1582" height="1032" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, Samsung had the right idea by giving users options with the button while retaining its primary functionality.

One press captures content, a double press begins recording, and a long press opens Essential Space, allowing you to view all your saved content.</p><p>It’s not extremely customizable, but it already makes more sense than Motorola’s implementation, as it provides easy access to content in the hub in addition to having a function that can be activated with a single button press, something Motorola doesn’t offer. Not only that, but users are already finding ways to re-map the button, although hopefully Nothing will allow this sooner or later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB" name="Essential-Space-Organized" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TECNO is another company that has added a One-Tap button to devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phones/tecno-camon-40-premier-5g-review" target="_blank">Camon 40 Premier 5G</a>, which triggers its Ella AI assistant. Coincidentally, the button doesn’t actually do anything when you tap it once, but a long press will activate Ella, or you can customize the double-press to activate just about any app you want.</p><p>So far, it doesn’t seem like anyone has really perfected this extra button, but if anyone were to, it would likely be Samsung, given its experience with an AI button. However, another phone would be perfect for an AI button: the Pixel.</p><h2 id="perfect-for-pixel-2">Perfect for Pixel</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A5JUsMmXbpHi5T5WexKYy9" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-in-hand-rear.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A5JUsMmXbpHi5T5WexKYy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google needs an AI button on the Pixel. Although I would like to see Samsung implement the AI button again (and it definitely should), this would also be a very helpful addition for Pixel smartphones. Admittedly, the first and biggest reason I would love to see this doesn’t really have to do with AI.</p><p>For some time now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, including the Pixel 6 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">newer models</a>, have been defaulting to using the power button to trigger AI assistants. By default, turning off the phone now involves holding down the power button and the volume up button.

The Razr Ultra 2025 had a great opportunity with the AI Key, but so far has squandered it with its limited options and somewhat underwhelming Moto AI offering. Google (and by extension, Samsung) should learn from what Motorola and others have done with their buttons, improve upon it, and free the power button from the constraints of AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Do you want a phone that costs too much, has a sub-par camera, a tiny battery, and isn't as durable? If so, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> is your dream phone.</p><p>This phone is a certifiable 100% bona fide flop. Samsung made too many compromises because someone at the company decided that people wanted a thin phone and were willing to spend a whole lot of money on it. It almost sounds like a script for a comedy.</p><p>Sadly, it's not. It's another example of Samsung testing the waters to see what we can be convinced we want, except this time it failed. But that's okay; Samsung can afford to fail.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-edges-early-sales-seem-to-be-as-slim-as-the-phone-new-report-claims">phone apparently isn't selling very well</a>, but that isn't surprising. Samsung going ahead with the idea, even though it's kinda dumb, isn't surprising either. The company does this sort of thing and has been successful in the past. You only <em>really</em> know if an idea is worthwhile <em>after</em> you try it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="gbc7DSQzgnFgEqgN6adt7F" name="galaxy-note-white-ac.jpg" alt="The original Galaxy Note next to the S Pen" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbc7DSQzgnFgEqgN6adt7F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="681" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Samsung's willingness to do dumb shit brought us the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review">Galaxy Note</a>. If you like using your Apple Pencil, you need to thank Samsung for reminding us that there are times when your finger just won't cut it. When the first Galaxy Note launched, it was a flop too. T-Mobile actually canceled its version after it was announced and sent to reviewers — I know because they sent me one. Making a big ass phone with a stylus sounded stupid at the time.</p><p>Nobody is saying that today; the Galaxy Note has evolved into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phone Samsung</a> has ever made. Fight me. The company is going to do the same with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">book-style foldables</a> and has already generated almost all the interest there is for them, simply by saying "YOLO" and doing it. I love it when Samsung does that, and I hope they never stop. Giving us 10 bad ideas is worth it when that good one hits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AoHLkg7rrDhzmY37mzSUud" name="samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-lifestyle-widescreen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra leaning against a wicker basket, standing upright with its backside shown off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AoHLkg7rrDhzmY37mzSUud.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2320" height="1305" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's why the company decided phones needed to be thinner. Somewhere down the line, they will have perfected a way to do it without all the necessary drawbacks of today's tech. My opinion? Forcing a design to be this thin means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech">battery tech</a> has to be improved. A flop of a thin phone is step one to having a battery that's smaller, safer, and lasts longer.</p><p>Having said all of this — and I really do mean it all, I understand why this phone was built — let's take a look at what we actually got: a phone nobody was asking for and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/i-bought-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-but-no-one-else-did">nobody should buy</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-11" alt="Right side buttons and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's thin. I don't think it's the thinnest phone ever, but you can't deny that it's thinner than anything else you can buy today (excluding foldables). However, it's thin at the expense of other features that make a phone good.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-if-its-real-who-asked-for-this">I predicted this last January</a> when I said making a phone very thin using today's tech would mean you need to sacrifice battery life. I was slightly off; you also sacrificed camera quality, performance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-edge-durability-test-gauntlet-results">durability</a>. But mostly the battery.</p><p>Right now, the batteries are brand new, and you hear people say they almost last all day or will last all day if you manage it correctly. In 90 days, it will be "I can get by topping it off at dinner time," and in 180 days, people will need to charge it even more often. That's how batteries work; the more you use them, the less you <em>can</em> use them.</p><p>As someone who used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-phones-pick-new-features-start-june">Pixel 4</a> for a year, let me tell you that it only gets worse from here. A smartphone is useless without any gas in the tank.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-12" alt="Battery activity results on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Surprisingly, that's not enough to kill a phone at launch. People will want it because it's thin and can get by using a cable and a charger. What killed the S25 Edge was its $1,000+ asking price.</p><p>Samsung can pretend that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-top-exec-addresses-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-woes">they didn't compromise</a> to make a phone this thin, but even the people saying that know the truth. This is a prototype of the next big idea, and the only way for it to get better is to build it and work through it all. If it sticks around, we might love what it turns into.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In reality, the company has been trying to figure out mobile devices since 2009, before pivoting to apps that only offered specific editing features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GWzSUiSHX2bjyLWih3XjkC" name="Photoshop-Express-Galaxy-Tab" alt="Photo editing software on an iPad Pro M4 (left) and Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GWzSUiSHX2bjyLWih3XjkC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Using Photoshop and Lightroom has become an essential part of my workflow, so needless to say, I was ecstatic to see it arrive on the Play Store.

The move came alongside a big new feature: the ability to find people, not just your devices. Right on cue, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-find-hub-app-redesign-rolling-out">the app got a fresh update too</a>—now called Find Hub—with new Device and People tabs to make that rebrand crystal clear.</p><p>Google is betting big on UWB (Ultra-wideband) to make Find Hub actually useful when you need it most.

Google is also gearing up to add satellite connectivity. That means even when you’re way off the grid with no cell signal, you can still stay connected with friends and family.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Marvel's Deadpool VR was announced at Summer Games Fest today, but I got to try an early demo in late May at Meta's offices in California.</p><p>Marvel's Deadpool VR stars Emmy-winning Neil Patrick Harris as the titular antihero and was developed by Twisted Pixel. Acquired by Meta in 2021, Twisted Pixel last made beat-em-up VR game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/path-of-the-warrior/2032870023439846">Path of the Warrior</a> in 2019. Deadpool has evidently been years in the making.</p><p>The game felt like an immediate and obvious foil to 2024's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow VR</a>, made by another Meta-acquired developer, Camouflaj. Both have professional voice actors, long story-driven campaigns, and demanding next-gen graphics. And yet they couldn't be more different in combat, movement, and tone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hjHzpAoQXNBfcakQUMcgHH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-slash-effect" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing a bloody sword attack and comic-book script "SLASHIMI!" above a dying bad guy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjHzpAoQXNBfcakQUMcgHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Deadpool snarks his way around a SHIELD helicarrier, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mojoworld">Mojoworld</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_of_Xandar">Spirit of Xandar</a>, and other Marvel Comics multiverse locales that feel like polar opposites to the dark, grounded Gotham. And the violent gun and sword battles felt more chaotic and less structured than Batman's mix of timed punches and gadget combos.</p><p>It also sounds <em>very</em> different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)">Activision's Deadpool</a> from 2013, which heavily focused on the X-Men comics and characters like Wolverine and Rogue. Deadpool VR's cast stars more niche characters like Mojo, Lady Deathstrike, and Flag-Smasher, and the narrative doesn't seem quite as dependent on 4th-wall breaks as the old game.</p><p>Having spent nearly an hour bumbling through one of the early levels, I can share my thoughts on the best and worst parts of Marvel's Deadpool VR during my hands-on, as well as all the game info that Twisted Pixel shared with us during the Q&A afterwards.</p><h2 id="gory-creative-combat-and-silly-one-liners-2">Gory, creative combat and silly one-liners</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Jof1MtYccs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>My demo started fairly early on in Marvel's Deadpool VR storyline, with Deadpool's head being studied by an evil scientist on a stolen helicarrier before you control his headless body to kill the scientist and free yourself.</p><p>Then you run through the ship, guided by a hapless SHIELD rookie by comms as you learn the controls and combat. By default, you can grab a sword over your shoulder, gun from your hip, or grenade from your wrist, and more weapons will be introduced as the game continues like a bow and arrow.</p><p>When you take damage, parts of Deadpool will fall off, and you'll have to adjust your gameplay strategy accordingly (until they grow back).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AAM7zMAMQcvn2bZatsTG6H" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-cutscene" alt="A screenshot of Deadpool's headless body about to slam a bloodied scientist's head against a desk, with cartoonish text "Was that a tooth?!" next to him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AAM7zMAMQcvn2bZatsTG6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I had the least trouble mastering gunplay, aiming your default pistol or picking up weapons along the way and blasting waves of foes. You can aim at specific body parts to blast them off or use a grapple weapon to fling or disarm foes.</p><p>But gun combat is fairly common in a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a>, and the developers want you to get more creative. For that, the focal point is the close-quarters combat. With the sword, you can dismember body parts, then pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can counter attacks from shielded foes, or fling your sword at a far-away enemy before grabbing a new one.</p><p>The goal, Twisted Pixel said, is to "Say yes to the player" and "reward creativity," and that there was a "bunch of stuff that you guys didn't try" that we'd discover naturally across the campaign, but is available from the start.</p><p>The devs also promised things like a "boomerang sword" and "exploding bullets," and there will be custom moves you can use against specific enemies or with certain weapons.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="24v6m78PT2Yw9gRYmkGKyG" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-violent-sword-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing an impaled head on a held sword with the headless soldier in the near distance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/24v6m78PT2Yw9gRYmkGKyG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, sword combat is also where I had the most trouble. I would swipe my sword at a foe and, for whatever reason, it would simply dance around their body with no effect while they hit or shot me. I especially struggled with shielded foes meant for close-quarters combat, who would wail on me while I swiped helplessly back.</p><p>I assumed it was a skill issue on my end, and I needed to master the timing of sword strikes better. But other journalists I spoke to after the demo agreed that sword attacks felt somewhat weightless.</p><p>The Twisted Pixel devs responded by saying they didn't want the reverse side of VR melee combat, where you simply hold your sword toward an enemy, "waggle it," and have it "chop people up instantly." They say they're "still working on" a "combination of animation, haptic feedback, and sound" to make sword impacts feel satisfying.</p><p>So I'm curious how it'll feel in the final version, with more practice. I'd say swordplay is the most important part of a Deadpool VR game, so I'm hoping they get it right.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mAKH2oeLeJ6drmf5mRaPWH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-sword-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool holding a sword and throwing knife as two ninja-like foes charge towards the player." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mAKH2oeLeJ6drmf5mRaPWH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yaZqsMWvJDow3EtTVRrtRH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-bow-and-arrow-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the player holding a bow and arrow, pointing at a charging ninja enemy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaZqsMWvJDow3EtTVRrtRH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PN63uPW5fkRMo5rohWpCNH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-gun-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool dual-wielding pistols pointed at a cyborg enemy leaping down towards the player." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PN63uPW5fkRMo5rohWpCNH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="2Ai9zRfMFdprhZd7mii6GH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-sniper-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the player pointing a laser-pointed sniper rifle at a foe across the room." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Ai9zRfMFdprhZd7mii6GH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Outside of combat, Deadpool runs and parkours around the stage, with double-jumping available for more flexible movement.

They said their version of Deadpool "pulls more strongly from the comics" than from the movie Deadpool.

If you know what specs you're looking for and in what sort of price range, one look at this chart will tell you which cable is right for you.</p><p>If you're still clueless, don't worry my friend. I've got you! Ask yourself a few questions and the answer will become clear.</p><p>First off, what phone do you use? If you're an Apple user with an iPhone older than the 15 series, obviously you'll need a lightning connector. Anker and Raycon are both great options. The Raycon cable is superior from every perspective, except for the cost. It's got swappable connectors so you can use it with all your other gadgets too. If you don't want to spend $35 on a cable, Anker will do just fine.</p><p>For my Android users, pick the Baseus 100W cable and don't look back. The 6ft variant is long enough for most use cases and the nylon-braided structure makes it highly durable. And get this, the 6ft version is only $10! That's the best deal you'll ever find on such a speedy USB-C cable.</p><p>Now, if you've got a wired pair of headphones, earphones, or in-ear monitors, you'll probably want to check out the budget-friendly JSAUX USB-C Headphone Charger too. This DAC adds a handy 3.5mm headphone jack to your smartphone, something all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> lack these days. Since there's USB-C passthrough charging, you don't even have to worry about blocking off your Type-C port when using the adapter. For $13, that's as good as it gets.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Will it get cheaper, and is it worth it to buy the 2024 device when the next-gen flip phone drops? </p><p>After all, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 debuted last summer with a steep $1,099.99 price tag, so it&apos;s no wonder people have been looking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">deals</a>. At this point we can only speculate, but I&apos;ve been working launches like this long enough that I have a pretty good idea of what you can expect. Let&apos;s dive in. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>If the latest leaks and rumors are correct, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will be revealed during a live Samsung Unpacked event in early July. The new clamshell foldable will likely be announced alongside the premium Galaxy Z Fold 7 and two Samsung smartwatches, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic</a>. </p><p>The Z Flip 7 is expected to come loaded with a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, an updated design, and a larger cover display than ever before (think more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr</a>-esque). The flip phone is also certain to feature all of the latest Galaxy AI software features and seven years of guaranteed OS and security upgrades. As for the cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-alleged-galaxy-z-flip-7-camera-specs-detailed">one rumor</a> has suggested that the Z Flip 7 will retain its predecessor&apos;s camera tech, which would be quite controversial among Samsung users if the leak proves accurate. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Flex-Mode-Panel.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex Mode Panel with Instagram running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, the biggest question mark comes down to the phone&apos;s price. After several generations without a price increase, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 was revealed last year with a starting price of $1,099.99, which was $100 more than its predecessor.</p><p>Will Samsung increase the price of its clamshell phone again in 2025? It&apos;s hard to say, but considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra (2025)</a> — the Flip&apos;s biggest competitor — was recently unveiled with a $1,300 price tag, I wouldn&apos;t put it past them. There&apos;s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-hold-back-the-budget-galaxy-z-flip-7-model-until-late-2025">some speculation</a> that the Z Flip 7 will be announced alongside a more-affordable "Fan Edition" version of the phone, but details on that rumor are scarce.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-z-flip-6-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Z Flip 6 get cheaper?</span></h3><p>So now for the big question: will last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> finally get cheaper now that the Z Flip 7 is on the way? The answer may not be as simple as you&apos;d like. </p><p>The good news is that the top-rated flip phone is already being discounted fairly often by retailers and wireless carriers alike. As of writing, for example, the unlocked Z Flip 6 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D195JKYD"><strong>over $200 off at Amazon,</strong></a> while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip6.html"><strong>AT&T is dropping up to $1,000 off</strong></a> the phone when you trade in and add a line. </p><p>Now, you might see those deals and be tempted to wait until the Z Flip 7 arrives to see if the price drops even further, but I&apos;d be careful. Retailers will often discount a phone <em>before</em> its next generation arrives to make room for new stock. This means that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 might be sold out on most sites by the time you&apos;re ready to buy, which gives you less leverage as a consumer.</p><p>But there&apos;s a bright side. Amazon&apos;s Prime Day sale is likely to be announced in the coming weeks, and if past year&apos;s are any indication, the event will fall right around the same time as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 announcement. <strong>This upcoming sale might be the best opportunity to get the Galaxy Z Flip 6 at a serious discount</strong>, as retailers all across the web will be taking on Amazon with competitive offers of their own. This puts you in the driver&apos;s seat, and it will likely result in some of the best Galaxy Z Flip 6 deals we&apos;ve ever seen. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8a540a43-dcb6-468b-b250-8c0176ee90d9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JrEgbbZSCjj6z4VY5Zx5XP.jpg' alt="Render of the blue Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still a great flip phone</strong></em></p><p>Although it's about to hit last-gen status, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 remains a great <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> with a sleek, super-pocketable design, loads of AI features, and years of guaranteed software support.

This year, Spotify said it paid out over $10 billion to the music industry globally in 2024, marking the largest single-year payout by any retailer in music history.</p><p>The report also adds that nearly 1,500 artists generated over $1 million in royalties from Spotify alone in 2024. And 80% of these artists didn't have their song reach the Spotify Global Daily Top 50 chart. Meaning, without having a mainstream hit, they were still able to generate revenue.</p><p>The surprising part, however, is that Canadian artists seem to be thriving globally, and in 2024, Canadian music artists earned CAD<strong> </strong>$460 million in royalties on Spotify, which is almost double the earnings they made since 2019. Spotify says this was possible because Canadian-grown global stars like The Weeknd, Justin Bieber, Céline Dion, and more have built a strong foundation for budding artists.</p><p>"That’s not just streams; that’s sustainable careers being built in studios, basements, and tour vans from Vancouver to Halifax," the streaming giant added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3imaMspAbZLSG2pt5DtEZT" name="The-Weeknd-on-Spotify" alt="The Weeknd on Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3imaMspAbZLSG2pt5DtEZT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of where these royalties were earned, Spotify says that 94% of the money earned by Canadian artists through Spotify came from outside Canada.</p><p>This means Canada has become one of the world's top music exporters, and that Canadian music is not only being streamed locally but also in "cities like Jakarta, Osaka, Melbourne, London, São Paulo, Berlin, Mexico City, and Seoul."</p><p>Since Canada is a bilingual country, its French music also saw a 15% growth in global Spotify royalties just in the past year.</p><p>For instance, "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/44A0o4jA8F2ZF03Zacwlwx">Québécois artist Patrick Watson’s 'Je te laisserai des mots'</a> was the most popular francophone track on Spotify globally in 2024, and the first French-language track to pass 1 billion streams," the report stated.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU" name="Spotify-Jam" alt="Spotify Jam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, Spotify says that Canadian women have also been at the front and center of music creation, and since 2020, their global streams on Spotify have also doubled. And as of 2024, "40% of Canadian artists earning over CAD $1 million on Spotify were women or in groups with both male and female members."</p><p>“This is what Canada sounds like—diverse, digital, and not just thriving domestically, but leading on the world stage. The data is clear in underscoring the vital role that export plays in sustaining the overall health of Canada’s music industry,” said Xenia Manning, director of Global Music Policy, Spotify.</p> ]]></dc:content>
