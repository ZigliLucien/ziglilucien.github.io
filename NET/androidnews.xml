I used most phones released in 2024, and it has been a good year for device launches, both in the flagship and mid-range segments.</p><p>The state of the phone industry is such that we don&apos;t get massive upgrades every single year, and as such, most 2024 phones have been iterative updates. What&apos;s ironic is that the few devices that really stood out this year — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo X100 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultr</a>a, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> — are limited to select regions and aren&apos;t widely available.</p><p>That said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9</a> series is noticeably better than previous years, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> has improved tuning that allows it to take great photos, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is undoubtedly one of the biggest hits of the year.</p><p>If you&apos;re on an older device and are looking to upgrade or just need to make the switch to the latest tech, these are my phone recommendations for Black Friday. Although phone deals aren&apos;t live yet, earlier sales in the year gave us a good indication as to what we might get in terms of pricing, and I&apos;m adding my own estimates.</p>

<p>OnePlus did all the right things in 2024, and the OnePlus 12 continues to be a fantastic device. It handles demanding games without breaking a sweat, the battery life is among the best of any device, and it has already switched to a stable Android 15 build. The cameras are terrific as well, and it is able to hold its own against the best Android phones. The OnePlus 12 went down to as low as $599 earlier in the year, and that might be the case this holiday season as well. If it's anything under $599, the phone becomes an instant buy.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Smartphone-Processor-Hasselblad/dp/B0CQ5MYYZL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="085cf796-f1af-486e-8e5d-2d5f28b00cae" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="OnePlus 12: $802 at Amazon" data-dimension48="OnePlus 12: $802 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>I used the 9 Pro XL much more than the regular 9 Pro, but I got started with the latter recently, and I have to say that I prefer it to the larger model. You get the same great cameras and software features, and while the battery isn't as big, I still get a day's worth out of it. While the device is relatively new, Google is usually generous with holiday deals, and if you can get anywhere close to $200 off, just buy the phone.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HVCD91" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="932d0eb9-7404-4ee3-bee0-815a0d756d49" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9 Pro: $999 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 9 Pro: $999 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>I test a lot of mid-range phones, and there are only two devices you need to pay attention to in this category: the Pixel 8a and OnePlus 12R. The Pixel 8a has better cameras, and the hardware is decent — if not great for gaming. You get a good OLED panel with 120Hz refresh, good battery life, and the best software of any mid-range phone. The Pixel 8a went down to $379 (it's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-8a-Unlocked-Advanced/dp/B0CYQ916ZY?">$399 right now</a>) earlier in the year, and it should be available for the same price once again, making it the bargain of the year.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-8a-Unlocked-Advanced/dp/B0CYQFJSRF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9c1ee2f6-7c7e-401a-b4d3-55d4cb083e77" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 8a: $399 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 8a: $399 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>It's a good thing OnePlus decided to sell the 12R globally, because the phone is still one of the best value-focused devices available today. It has a vibrant AMOLED panel, great hardware, terrific main camera, and stellar battery life and fast charging tech. It was available for $399, but anything lower than that would make it a downright steal.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ9SZ6CP?" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c923b2b0-1015-452b-9008-3f508010d57a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="OnePlus 12R: $499 at Amazon" data-dimension48="OnePlus 12R: $499 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>You don't actually need to wait until Black Friday as the S24 Ultra is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDM65JH">down to $1,079</a> right now, but I recommend waiting — it's going to be discounted in the coming weeks. Although the S25 Ultra is on the horizon, it shouldn't be radically different to what Samsung is already offering, and if you can get the S24 Ultra for anywhere close to the $900 mark, it would be a great option.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDM65JH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d4204912-f7f7-4482-adad-794b574fda15" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: $1,079 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: $1,079 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Retailers aren&apos;t waiting around until Black Friday to launch deals; Walmart already has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/walmart-just-dropped-its-first-batch-of-black-friday-deals-and-android-users-should-take-note">early deals available right now</a>, and they include decent discounts. I&apos;ll update this post once any of the deals on the aforementioned devices go live, so check back regularly.</p>

<p>Now that the Samsung Galaxy S24 has been out for a while, you can't help but wonder what specifications the next S series model will have. We don't have the official specs for the S25 just yet, but with all the rumors and leaks out there, we are creating a speculative Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S24 comparison to get an idea of what you <em>might</em> get and whether it might be worth upgrading to the next model.</p><p>If it follows the same pattern as the last two launches, Samsung could announce the S25 before January ends. The first rumors about the S25 appeared in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-rumored-price-increase">October 2023</a>, stating that the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</a> could lead to a higher price tag at launch. Time will tell what official specs we see on the S25, but in the meantime, putting together a speculative comparison will be fun.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZMFgD8diq9sFmCHf975Zkm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-purple-01.jpg" alt="Looking at the different colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMFgD8diq9sFmCHf975Zkm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regarding design, there is a good chance Samsung will stick to the design we've been looking at for years, which has rounded edges, a flat front, and flat sides. Rumors also indicate we could see the same colors from the S24 on the S25 model. That said, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">leaked renders</a>, we could be looking at a slight design change. It seems like Samsung is going for a unified look across all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra models.</p><p>The S25 could have flat sides all around, flat back and front glass, and rounded corners. Rumors also say the S25 will be slightly smaller than the previous model, possibly 146.94 x 70.46 x 7.25mm. The phone's weight is unavailable, but it may weigh around 167 and 168 grams, given that the past three models are between this weight range. We haven't encountered any rumors on the possible IP rating for the S25, but since the S24 has an IP68 rating, there is no reason to think that the S25 won't see a similar rating on the S25.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-color-options-tipped">possible colors for the S25</a> include Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Blue, and Titanium Silver. Samsung has not released any official information on the specs of the S25. Still, regarding the IP rating, the expectation is that it'll maintain the S24's rating since it's a standard rating for high-end flagship phones. You can also expect it to have thinner bezels.</p><p>The <strong>Samsung Galaxy S24</strong> measures 147.0 x 70.6 7.6mm, weighs 167 grams, and has an IP68 rating, which makes it dust-tight. You can submerge it for 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. You can choose from different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-galaxy-s24-should-you-buy">Galaxy S24 colors</a>, such as Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Onyx Black, and Marble Grey (Samsung exclusive Jade Green, Sapphire Blue, Sandstone Orange).</p><p>It also has a flat front and back with rounded edges and a soft finish. Armor aluminum makes the Galaxy S24 lighter than steel. It also has a Corning Gorilla Armor screen, which makes it more durable. The three cameras are in a vertical row on the back, a design likely to repeat itself on the newer model.</p>

<p>Like with almost every upgrade from the same manufacturer, there is usually no massive difference between the latest and previous models.

The Galaxy S24 can reach a peak brightness of 2,600 nits and has Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection. It offers excellent colors and a Super HDR preview on the viewfinder. Samsung also added Vision Booster to increase the brightness outdoors by flickering the display on and off.</p>

<p>Rumors about the <strong>Samsung Galaxy S25</strong> mention that Samsung could drop its current camera hardware in favor of Sony. According to a leak, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> (essentially a rebranded Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip) will give the phone a performance jump thanks to the Oryon cores. Other rumors indicate Samsung could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-models-to-opt-for-flagship-exynos-soc-again">opt for an Exynos chip</a>, saving the Snapdragon for the Ultra model.</p><p>All three S25 models could borrow the camera module style for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and come with a more traditional DSLR camera lens with thicker borders and ribbed edges. The leaked renders don't show an S Pen for the Ultra model, but we still don't know what the final design will look like, meaning Samsung may not be ditching the built-in stylus.</p><p>Recognized tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1837452794909086073">Ice Universe</a> also states that the S25 will have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-triple-camera-array-rumors">same camera setup as the S24</a>. which would corroborate other rumors. The smartphone could have a 50MP wide main, 10MP telephoto, and 12MP ultrawide. It also has a 12MP selfie camera. If the rumors are true and the camera specs are the same, the rumored added <strong>RAM</strong> to help process the AI could make up for it.</p><p>Even though Samsung has not confirmed the specs, and the S25 at least matches its predecessor, we could be looking at storage options such as 128GB and 256GB. The S25 should have a 4,000mAh battery and support wired and wireless charging. However, some leaks indicate a 5,000mAh battery, which is even better. If the S25 does have a bigger battery, there is a good chance we could see the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-flagship-phones-might-get-a-battery-boosting-ai-feature">new AI battery feature</a> aims to save up to 10% of battery life.</p><p>How does this compare to the <strong>Galaxy S24</strong> that is available right now? It has non-expandable 128GB and 256GB storage variants, stereo speakers, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 4,000mAh battery. The Galaxy S24 also has a 50MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP telephoto, and 12MP selfie camera.</p><p>Regarding charging speeds, the Galaxy S24 has 25W wired charging, 15W wireless, and 4.5 reverse wireless charging. The advertised charging speed is 50% battery in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>We know the Galaxy S25 will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">One UI 7</a> on top of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>. The software upgrade appears to include a new visual style, icons, customization options, and more.

With Galaxy AI, you can have fun with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">generative AI wallpaper</a> and generative edit features.

You can also have Gemini help you get information, identify objects, or tell you where to buy them. You also get seven years of software updates, so there is no reason to believe why you wouldn't get the same with the S25.</p>

However, it might be pricey if the S25 launches with the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor.</p><p>It's a little hard to decide which one to go with since the Galaxy S24 is a great option. However, without knowing the official Galaxy S25 details, you may be better off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-should-you-wait">waiting for the Galaxy S25</a> to launch before deciding.

Samsung has not officially given a date for Samsung Unpacked, but if it follows last year's launch, we can see the official specs before the end of January 2025. Remember, good things come to those who wait.</p>

<p>Reports state Google has started rolling out its new Quick Share app for Windows PCs and laptops.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/11/google-quick-share-windows-arm-release-coming/">9to5Google</a>, the company has started pushing a revamped version of the Quick Share app for ARM-based Windows computers. Google made this upgraded app known via its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/better-together/quick-share-app/">updated Quick Share page</a>. The company states users with a Windows computer running the 64-bit version of Windows 10 and up can download and install.</p><p>Moreover, Google highlights the app's newfound availability on ARM-supported Windows PCs and laptops running Windows 11 and higher. With the app slowly becoming available, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/13801258?visit_id=638669564879441517-2725905576&p=windows_nearby_share&rd=1#topic=7313011">Google states</a> folks in the U.S. and "most countries" can find it to download.</p><p>Those downloading the Quick Share app on Windows are encouraged to update their sharing settings. Google states users should click <strong>Settings > Device Visibility </strong>and select a preferable option. An option titled "Your Device" lets your PC/laptop find devices with your Google Account.</p><p>Additionally, users should enable Wi-Fi <em>and </em>Bluetooth, so the Quick Share app can function properly.</p><p>Google's newfound support for "ARM-supported" Windows computers concerns those rocking Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite chipset</a>. The SoC was highlighted as one ready for the future of AI with "4.5 times faster" processing speed "than competitors." Qualcomm also stated that it wanted to facilitate a seamless experience between mobile, PC, and cars.</p><p>Of course, we're seeing that pairing much more now with the addition of Google's updated Quick Share app for Windows.</p>

<p>The publication states that the ability to download the new Quick Share app hasn't arrived just yet. The manual download button isn't functioning, but that should be solved within the day or later this week.</p><p>As Google upgrades its Quick Share app for more Windows computers, the company is reportedly working to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-likely-to-bring-android-quick-share-for-apple-devices">bring it to iOS devices</a>. A dive into the popular Android app revealed that Google could debut the app on iPhones and Macs after a recent patch. The changelog reportedly stated the fixes were implemented to "benefit" Apple's devices.</p><p>Google has yet to debut the app, but this little line could spell its impending launch.</p><p>Moreover, Google's updated Quick Share app is another option for Windows users who'd rather not use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/phone-link-is-looking-more-like-windows-answer-to-apples-airdrop">Phone Link</a>. The app picked up an update this summer that made its version of file sharing much easier to rival Apple's AirDrop.</p>

<ul><li>Galaxy device owners from the U.S. and South Korea will likely be the first ones to get the One UI 7 first beta.</li><li>Tipster Ice Universe has also indicated that the update rollout is likely happening next week, preferably after November 17.</li><li>Galaxy S24 series owners, followed by the Galaxy S23 series, are presumably the first ones to get the Android 15-based first beta.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One UI 7 beta is the highly anticipated operating system upgrade many flagship Galaxy owners look forward to. According to the latest information, it may happen sooner.</p><p>The tip comes from Ice Universe, who has shared the possible timeline and countries in the One UI 7 beta that will first ship. According to the tipster's X post, the Android 15-based One UI 7's first beta will hit devices sometime after November 17. The first regions are likely to be the U.S. and Samsung's home ground South Korea.</p>

<p>The latest information only corroborates what Samsung announced at its SDSC early last month. With a sneak peek, the Korean tech giant has announced that the first beta One UI 7 will be available for developers by the end of this year. According to the latest tip from Ice Universe, it will be coming early enough.</p><p>The global rollout, however, is likely coming early next year, with the launch of Samsung's next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a>, the Galaxy S25 series. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">During SDSC</a>, Samsung also noted that the upcoming One UI 7 update will include a "new UX focused on simple, impactful and emotive design alongside more ways to seamlessly integrate Galaxy AI features into daily activities."</p>
<p>Ice Universe has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1855803628336128186">also indicated</a> that One UI 7 will include numerous fashion elements alongside Google's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">Recent leaks</a> regarding the upcoming One UI firmware have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-android-15-update-gets-an-up-close-reveal-in-this-one-ui-7-hands-on-video">only indicated</a> smoother animations, updated icons, widgets, and new split notification panel, amongst others.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1852541549147746348">tipster notes</a> that the latest version of the One UI 7 in the works will be even more flexible than what the users have seen in the leaked videos with the OS running on Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>As rumored, the One UI 7 will indeed hit the markets in mid-November.

<ul><li>Google is reportedly gearing up to launch Gemini 2.0, its next artificial intelligence model.</li><li>Now, a new model titled <strong>Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-0111</strong> has appeared for at least one user of the Gemini web client.</li><li>It's unclear if this curiously-named AI model is truly powered by Gemini 2.0 Pro, or when the model will become widely available.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google and OpenAI are both planning to release the next versions of their flagship AI models by year's end, or in early 2024. Prior reports indicated that the two companies are gearing up to ship Gemini 2.0 and Orion, respectively, sometime in December. More recently, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.testingcatalog.com/google-gearing-up-for-gemini-2-0-launch-with-new-ai-model-in-testing/" target="_blank">TestingCatalog</a> spotted a new and conspicuously-named Gemini model that could be Gemini 2.0 Pro.</p><p>TestingCatalog says that the model is "quite fast" responding to prompts, but that it's impossible to know whether it's really Gemini 2.0 Pro under the hood. It's named <strong>Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-0111</strong>, and was discovered in the dropdown menu that lets you select which model the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> chatbot uses. Currently, the option for free users is Gemini 1.5 Flash. Paid subscribers gain access to Gemini Advanced, which adds Gemini 1.5 Pro.</p><p>The new <strong>Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-0111 </strong>model appears under the Gemini Advanced section in the dropdown menu, signaling that it will begin as a paid exclusive. However, it's possible (and perhaps likely) that Google is working on a Gemini 2.0 Flash model that could replace Gemini 1.5 Flash for free users.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can already prompt it and get a response. It seems to be working quite fast but I am still uncertain if the response comes from 2.0 for real 🤖

It also can draw images and use web search! pic.twitter.com/PkYgGCcvVp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1854666487052570648">November 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>There is reason to believe that <strong>Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-0111</strong> is really Gemini 2.0 Pro, like how it's labeled as "our experimental model" by Google. However, there's no way to know for sure. It could be a user-interface test, or simply appear by accident. Being that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-2-dot-0-likely-to-launch-in-december-2024">prior reports expected a December 2024 release for Gemini 2.0</a>, it's reasonable that Google would be expanding tests for the model in the days or weeks immediately preceding its launch.</p><p>TestingCatalog confirms that <strong>Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-0111</strong> can respond to prompts, draw images, and search the web. It's not available to the public yet, so you won't find it by going to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">gemini.google.com</a>. A release sometime next month would mark exactly one year after the first Gemini model debuted. As a reminder, Gemini now references the underlying model (like the upcoming Gemini Pro 2.0 model), and the interface that lets you interact with the model (such as the Gemini web client).</p><p>By all accounts, the Gemini 2.0 Pro model will be made available as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>, which costs $20 per month and includes Gemini Advanced.</p>

<ul><li>Instagram Head Adam Mosseri has revealed an interesting new feature on Instagram, which many unknowingly considered a bug.</li><li>When an average user opens Instagram, the annoying refresh of already-preloaded video on the feed is a feature dubbed “rug pull.”</li><li>Mosseri shared it, and as many of the audience members found the feature “really annoying, ” the company has now chosen to remove it entirely.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you are an avid Instagram user, you would have experienced the annoying refresh whenever you open the app and look at a preloaded video, which goes away every time you open the app. While it looks like some kind of bug, Instagram Head notes it isn’t, and however, the feature is being pulled off.</p><p>In a recent AMA Story (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/9/24292040/instagram-stops-loading-videos-after-opening-app-rug-pull-adam-mosseri">The Verge</a>) on the social media platform, Instagram Head Adam Mosseri indicates that the said feature was internally called “rug pull.” And it was featured “because we were trying to load new content, and it was taking a while, so we showed you something that was already downloaded in the meantime, and it is generally good for engagement, ” said Mosseri in the respective story.</p>

<p>He further acknowledged that it was really annoying for many. Hence, Instagram has decided to stop doing it, even though average users wouldn’t immediately notice it.</p><p>Mosseri has further noted that a little bit of engagement has been affected in the process, although it happens to be a good riddance. It is interesting to know it wasn’t a bug after all but rather an incorporated feature by the Meta-owned platform. The app experience is believed to be much better from now on, presumably for both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and iOS handset holders.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Instagram has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-now-save-songs-from-instagram-straight-to-spotify-without-the-hassle">recently added</a> a new feature for users who are music enthusiasts. Music plays a key role as it can be added to posts, stories, reels, and whatnot. Music lovers who are also on Spotify can directly save the audio track to their respective Spotify accounts when they listen to a song on Instagram.</p><p>For example, if they hear a song attached to the reel, clicking on the audio track will feature a new Spotify Add button. Tapping on it will quickly save to the linked Spotify account. This is indeed a handy feature, as finding music can be quite easy, which otherwise would have been a cumbersome process.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, early this month, Mosseri, who also leads Threads, announced that the platform, which was announced as a rival to X (formerly Twitter), has crossed 275 million monthly active users. He further stated that there is much more to be improved and fixed regarding the microblogging site.</p>

<ul><li>A new Samsung patent was discovered as the company submitted information and illustrations for an XR headset.</li><li>The headset features a slim front design alongside the ability to create "reference points" for its virtual space to aid the user's FoV.</li><li>The recently filed patent also showed an illustration for a set of glasses, which Samsung alluded to in a brief explainer.</li><li>Samsung reportedly delayed the launch of its intended XR headset to "better compete" with Apple's Vision Pro.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's AR headset has reportedly progressed as a new patent was discovered with details about its specifications.</p><p>The Korean OEM's next "AR headset" in development was spotted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2024228464">WIPO database</a> as it filed a patent for its design. The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-ar-head-mounted-display-patent-wipo/">91Mobiles</a> dug into the patent, discovering its potential design and a few specifications. From the patent, it seems the AR headset in question will wrap around a user's head like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vr-headset-announcement">Apple Vision Pro</a> or Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a>.</p><p>The front portion housing the visual elements seems slim and the patent's illustrations show two circular areas for your vision. The front part over a person's eyes will likely contain the device's onboard RAM, SSD, and other internal components.</p><p>Speaking of visuals, the patent reportedly states the device utilizes "reference points" in virtual space. This is supposedly done in relativity to "real-world space for navigation and operation." The patent states the device maps your FoV (field of view) to achieve this once the headset is worn. Moreover, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2024228464#:~:text=mounted%20device%20(HMD).-,Detailed%20description%20of%20the%20invention,-A%20means%20of">filing's full explanation</a> (machine-translated) adds that the device's camera may offer information about a "visual object" for identification purposes.</p><p>The post states that the patent's specifications include 5G, 6G, Bluetooth, and NFC support. More importantly, the screen's quality is still uncertain as rumors claim it could arrive as an LCD or an OLED display.</p>

<p>Curiously, Samsung's recent patent includes a brief look at a potential set of AR/XR glasses. One illustration showcases the glasses alongside the front of the headset, likely detailing visual component information. What's more, the company's patent details this unnamed device as a "wearable device for displaying visual objects."</p><p>The publication found another tidbit from Samsung, stating the device could be "AR glasses and/or a head-mounted device."</p><p>In 2023, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-xr-headset-reportedly-delayed">reportedly delayed</a> its planned XR headset to "better compete" with Apple's Vision Pro. A report claimed that a company's internal memo read, "we decided to review all internal specifications and performance, such as the design and panel of the new XR product." If we're going to get excited, perhaps this newfound patent is a (happy) indication of Samsung's XR headset coming to fruition.</p><p>That report from 2023 claimed that Samsung wanted to improve the device's design and performance and provide it with "high-resolution" displays. The patent is notably missing these important specs.</p><p>Samsung is likely deep in development. As such, a potential launch timeframe is still unknown.</p>

<p>Google Maps appears to be gearing up to add more car icon options, four years after first introducing them.</p><p>Currently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> only gives you a few basic choices for vehicle icons—a red sedan, a yellow SUV, and a green pickup truck. This feature was introduced back in 2020, and it hasn’t really seen any updates since.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-testing-new-vehicle-icons/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> recently found that Google is working on new ways to customize vehicle markers in Maps, with a fresh update currently being tested.</p><p>If the current testing goes well, a future Maps update will offer users five new vehicle models, including a hatchback, a Jeep, sedan, SUV, and a Tesla-inspired design. Additionally, there will be eight new color options to choose from, expanding the customization choices for your vehicle icon.</p><p>The classic blue arrow and old vehicle icons will presumably stay, but the new color customization options won't be available for those older models—you'll only get them with the updated vehicle icons.</p>

<p>Android Police uncovered the expanded vehicle customization options on the iOS version of Google Maps. Though still limited, this marks a big step toward more personalization.</p><p>While these new icons might not be as playful as those on Waze, they do offer a more realistic take on real-world vehicles, moving beyond the old, limited choices.</p><p>Given that Google develops both Google Maps and Android, it makes sense to expect that the new vehicle customization features will eventually make their way to the Android version of the navigation app.</p>

From crashes to endless buffering, it was quickly becoming clear that I was going to have to change my streaming TV routine. I used my phone to cast apps to my Chromecast Ultra for a while but it turns out that casting is pretty annoying when it's the only way to watch. I like having a dedicated remote, and the Chromecast didn't have that.</p><p>Enter the Roku Ultra. I'd used Roku plenty of times before on my old TCL TV, not to mention many other TCL TVs that family members and friends have, so I was already confident that I'd enjoy the experience. But I didn't realize just how heads and tails better Roku Ultra was going to be over the built-in apps on my LG OLED.</p><p>From the speed to availability, picture quality, and the fantastic remote, Roku Ultra has been just about everything I've wanted in a streaming box for a surprisingly affordable price: just $99. In fact, as of this writing, Amazon has it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF44RTTP">on sale for $89</a>, making it even more of a reasonable upgrade over whatever you're currently using and an excellent alternative to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tv-boxes">best Android TV boxes</a>.</p>

<p>The difference in app quality and availability versus my LG OLED TV was pretty astonishing. Having bought it in 2017, my TV is technically "old" at this point — maybe I should look for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/black-friday-oled-tv-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-helpful-tips-for-saving-big-this-holiday-season">Black Friday OLED TV deal</a> — but things were working fine until recently. I'll admit that the experience has degraded over the years, though. The Apple TV Plus app on my TV, for instance, is supremely sluggish, while the same one on the Roku Ultra is buttery smooth and instantly responsive.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>App choice and quality was second to none, and shows like Rings of Power look better on my TV coming from the Roku Ultra than they did with the native Prime Video app.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The apps I used all delivered quality that was as good or better than the native ones on my TV. Watching "Rings of Power" on the Prime Video app, for instance, delivered better colors and HDR quality than the app on my TV, which was an unexpected bonus.</p><p>I also ran across many instances where apps simply weren't available on my TV, and casting from an app on my phone to the Chromecast wasn't always an optimal experience. Case in point, lots of apps that cast videos don't include those handy "skip intro" buttons whereas the same app on the Roku will.</p><p>I found that the time it took for me to turn the Roku on and navigate to the show I wanted to watch was generally quicker than if I had found it on my phone and proceeded to cast it to my TV or Chromecast. Typing certainly takes longer using the remote versus a phone but that's what the handy microphone on the remote is for.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The only thing that would make this remote better is gyro aiming control like my LG OLED TV remote has.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In fact, this remote works so well and is so well designed I don't want to use anything else. The keys are backlit so it's easy to see at any time of the day. If you lose the remote, a handy button on the right side of the Roku Ultra itself can be pressed so the remote emits an easy-to-find sound. We've already lost the remote twice over the past few weeks so I can attest to this function's reliability.</p><p>The voice functionality works brilliantly, too, letting you not only perform searches for shows to watch but also control playback without needing to touch the remote. I've used the "Hey Roku, pause" more than once because someone left the remote on the other side of the room after queuing up the show. It's really cool and reminds me at least a bit of the old Xbox One Kinect voice control.</p><p>I really wish it had gyro-aiming support like my LG OLED TV remote, but I can overlook it because of the cost. Heck, it even has a USB-C port on the bottom with a built-in rechargeable battery, so it's hard to complain about any missing feature in the niche.</p>

<p>As the name implies, a Chromecast is primarily built for casting streams to your TV, which is different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-google-tv-review">Chromecast with Google TV</a> dongle featuring the full Android TV OS on it (and as seen on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a>). The Google Cast protocol that powers my unit is the one that popularized the concept, so it's the most widely supported casting protocol that can be used anywhere. That being said, Roku still doesn't support Google Cast. That means if you've got a one-off device that doesn't support more than just Google Cast, you might have to jump through hoops to get it working.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Devices that only use Google Cast to cast still require workarounds, but those seem to be few and far beween.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Case in point, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> supports Google Cast and casting to the Meta Horizon app for easy viewing, but to get the feed on the TV, I'd need to cast to the Meta Horizon app and then mirror my phone's screen.</p><p>This really isn't that big of a deal, but it is an extra step beyond what I'm used to using. It may also take up more than once screen at a time depending on your phone. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> allows me to just cast a single app so that the feed is on my TV and I can still use my phone for whatever I want without the rest of the room seeing. Not all phones have this option, though.</p><p>I have yet to find any other devices that don't support the casting service the Roku has on it, though, so this conundrum should be a fairly isolated issue. Considering how little I actually cast my VR feed to my TV, though, it's not like this has caused many issues since I started using the Roku Ultra.</p><p>Would I love to see Google Cast eventually come to Roku? For sure. Would I go back just for it? Definitely not.</p>
