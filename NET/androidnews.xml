                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Well, this is different! In a world where companies talk a lot about sustainability, the new Beats Solo Buds walk the talk in an unexpected way: the case has no built-in battery for recharging, cutting down on toxic battery landfill waste. But fear not, audio friends! The buds themselves will give you 18 hours of playback, so you should be able to power through whatever your days call for without skipping a beat.</p><p>But is this a "feature" or a compromise? I&apos;ll make that clear, along with what else you are or aren&apos;t getting in Beats&apos; newest, relatively inexpensive earbuds.</p>

<p>Beginning June 18th, Beats Solo Buds are available to order in Transparent Red, Storm Gray, and Matte Black from Apple.com and authorized resellers for $79.99. </p><p>They’ll be available in Apple Store locations and other brick-and-mortars beginning June 20th. The Arctic Purple version I have for review will be available exclusively online or in-store from Apple or Target. </p>

<p><strong>*Note: the review unit sent to me is a pre-production device. </strong></p><p>With the Solo Buds, Beats continues its trend of <em>not</em> beating you down with booming bass. That isn’t to say that they don’t deliver on bass and sub-bass, but that this latest iteration of the Beats sound is more accessible to a broader audience.</p><p>These Solo Buds also continue Apple’s trend, under the Beats brand, of bringing an audio product to market with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review">native support for Apple <em>and</em> Android features.</a> On Android, that means you’ll have support for Google Fast Pair, multipoint pairing, and Google Find My Device, with additional features like button customization in the Beats app. This is possible because Beats doesn’t use the Apple H1 chip found in the Beats Fit Pro but instead uses its own proprietary platform. </p><p>Though I love all things bass, I treat music like a buffet; the more options, the better. That’s where Beats does great with its newer sound signature—providing tuning that should appeal to those who enjoy everything from classical music to hip-hop. The Solo Buds use the 8.2mm dual-element diaphragm transducers from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-studio-buds-plus-review">Studio Buds Plus,</a> so you’re getting a more neutral, balanced sound than in earlier years. Other than the transducer, the rest of the components and the ergonomics are unique to the Solo Buds.</p><p>I listened to a mix of genres to test these out. I started with a couple of tracks to test the soundstage: Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” and Michael Abels’ haunting “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga,” the main title track from the “Get Out” film’s soundtrack. The Solo Buds have a more “closed back” style architecture, which inherently lessens the airy effect you get with open-back headphones, and despite that, the size of the soundstage was still quite satisfying. Vocals were clear and bright without being as sibilant as Paul Simon can be with some earbuds.</p><p>“Violin Duel” from the Chevalier soundtrack is beautiful. The string sections’ attack is well defined, with solid separation throughout the rest of the instrumentation. Because the focus is on clarity with this newer generation of Beats, I also subjected the Solo Buds to the murkiest track known to mankind, Method Man’s “Biscuits,” and enjoyed the full mids, which allowed his vocals to cut through the muddy bass.</p>

<p>They have a larger battery than previous buds because there is no third battery in the case to recharge them on the go. You can plug them into your phone and top off there, but you’ll be draining your phone. The good news is that in my testing with the volume on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Google Pixel 7 Pro</a> at 50% of its max, using the AAC codec and streaming a Spotify 24-hour long lo-fi hip-hop playlist, the Solo Buds lasted a little over 18 hours. </p><p>When it comes time to recharge them, you&apos;ll need to supply your own USB-C cable. Just place those buds in the case and plug them into the USB-C port on the back of the tiny unit. The Solo Buds do have the 5-minute Fast Fuel feature, which gets you up to an hour of playback, with a full system recharge taking a little under an hour and a half.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vdTCKoLy5QrY2jAepXBPFN" name="beats-solo-buds-studio-buds-plus-compare.jpg" alt="Beats Solo Buds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vdTCKoLy5QrY2jAepXBPFN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other changes in the buds are due to Beats cutting down the case size. There’s no LED on the case for charging status. Instead, you’ll get different audio tones for charging, pairing, and battery status. There’s also no pairing button on the case, but you’ll just place the buds inside the case and hold the “b” button on either bud for a few seconds to pair them with your device(s). The buttons on the Solo Buds, like previous Beats buds before them, are mechanical, a design element I prefer in most cases.</p><p>Some might say that I should have the lack of charging in the case in the “What I don’t like” section, but with 18 hours of playback, I haven’t missed it. Remember that most truly wireless earbuds support between six and eight hours of playback on a single charge.</p><p>One final note here. The microphones work well. I made phone calls—because smartphones can actually do that—and callers on the other end said I sounded fine. I also recorded some audio directly to my phone using the Bluetooth mics, and the audio was clear and didn&apos;t sound like I was in a tunnel.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7yfNMDDfBHUMVsnjwKVrUP" name="beats-solo-buds-USB-C-hero.jpg" alt="Beats Solo Buds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7yfNMDDfBHUMVsnjwKVrUP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For $80, there really isn’t much to dislike about the Beats Solo Buds. That said, with regard to most consumers, it will be interesting to see how well these are received with their lack of ANC. Budget-friendly brands <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review">like Soundcore include it</a>, so are we at the point where those shopping for entry-level earbuds expect to see this feature included?</p><p>I could also say that I don’t like the lack of wireless charging, but that would make the case larger and defeat the point of the Solo Buds. The Soundcore Liberty 4 NC is $20 more and has a Qi-enabled case, but that case is roughly twice the size.</p><p>Next time, I’d also like to see a water ingress rating like that found on the more expensive Beats Studio Buds Plus, which is IPX4. Beats Solo Buds have no official IP rating.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MDTFQpmK6G9zHfzqJMfPv6" name="samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-with-galaxy-s23-fe-purple.jpg" alt="Black Galaxy Buds FE with Purple Galaxy S23 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MDTFQpmK6G9zHfzqJMfPv6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds">more feature-rich options</a> at this price point, but none are as small or as big on battery life. You could look at the Raycon Everyday Earbuds (2024 Edition), which have an IP66 rating and wireless charging. Then there’s the Philips Fidelio T1, which has ANC, wireless charging, IPX4, and support for the LDAC codec. </p><p>Soundcore has the Life P3, which has a solid sound and gets 10 hours of playback. Pretty much all of the alternatives will be larger, and only the Fidelio comes closest to 18-hour battery life, with 13 hours. You can peruse our roundup of the best inexpensive wireless earbuds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds">see several alternatives</a> to Beats Solo Buds.</p><p>Any other competitors I’d recommend would be upgrade options, as they’d all be at least $20 more—options like the previously mentioned Liberty 4 NC, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-a-review">Nothing Ear (a)</a>, or the Samsung Galaxy Buds FE.</p>

<p>Though the Beats Solo Buds have some stiff competition, they’re solid performers. You’d be hard-pressed to find many options this pocketable, at this price, that also sounds more neutral. Almost everyone in the space is tuning for the urban ear with a more bass-forward approach, while Beats offers a package that still produces solid bass and sub-bass but with greater emphasis on neutral sound and vocal clarity with a bump of warmth through the mids.</p><p>As someone who keeps earbuds in his pants coin pocket (or tries to), I find these fit my everyday carry habits delightfully, and you should find that they&apos;ll fit into your life pretty nicely, too.</p>

<p>Another interesting detail from the benchmark is the memory information of the XL model, which is expected to feature at least 16GB of RAM. In comparison, the standard Pixel 9, which has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/6549460">hit the Geekbench test</a>, had scored 1590 single core and 3821 multi-score with the same CPU architecture and with 3.1GHz prime core clock speeds. </p><p>While the ratings mentioned above are taken directly from the Geekbench site, the benchmark scores first spotted by MySmartPrice slightly differ. The Pixel 9 Pro XL scored 1378 and 3732 single and multi-core, respectively. Besides, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> scored 1653 and 3313 single and multi-core scores. </p>
<p>These variations could mean that these devices are likely in the testing phase as the launch is a little far at this point, and the final results when the devices hit shelves will likely differ again. Yet, these latest scores hint at what to expect from the upcoming Pixel 9 models, particularly the new Pixel 9 Pro XL, in terms of performance.</p><p>It is encouraging to see that Google is bringing the Pixel 9 Pro XL as the benchmark denotes. The moniker, however, is certainly interesting because the previous reports and renders have indicated that the new one in the trio is likely dubbed Pixel 9 XL as opposed to the Pro moniker.</p>

<p>In the earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">leaked renders</a>, the XL model is significantly larger than the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, and it is believed to have a massive 6.7-inch display, whereas the former models are likely to equip 6.2-inch and 6.3-inch displays. The Pro and XL models are expected to equip the same set of cameras involving three 50MP sensors with 0.5x, 1x, and 5x zoom options.</p><p>With the Pixel 9 Pro XL taking the front seat, we expect the base model, the standard Pixel 9, to be priced slightly less than the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, as this year, we are likely to see more options in the Pixel lineup.</p>

<hr>
<p>We have already seen Galaxy Buds 3 series likely opting for a new stem design this year — thanks to early marketing image leaks and via findings in the wearable app. Another Samsung app now tells us how to use the new stem design.</p><p>Together, Android tipster AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pinch-gestures-apk-teardown-3451977/">Android Authority</a>, who managed to tear down the Samsung Members app, have discovered Galaxy Buds 3 series&apos; new pinch sensor references, which also included the accompanying gestures to trigger them. These were witnessed in the <strong>5.0.00.11</strong> version of the Samsung Members app. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, some illustration which I found in a samsung app.• Two colors - Black and White• Pinch Sensor for pinch gestures Read More - https://t.co/jzlO6d2t08#Samsung pic.twitter.com/OqM5XI8tAB<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1802689378046849120">June 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Unlike the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">Galaxy Buds 2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a>, which didn&apos;t come with a stem design, they had to rely on swipes and taps for playback and ANC controls. The successors, however, will likely opt for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-buds-3-stem-design-leak">new stem design</a> similar to Apple&apos;s AirPods Pro models. The findings from the Samsung Members app give us a clear picture of the stem design and the pinch gestures happening towards the bottom side of the stem for both earbuds — presumably the Galaxy Buds 3 and the Buds 3 Pro.</p><p>Although the latest findings confirm the new pinch sensors for the upcoming Galaxy Buds 3 series, it doesn&apos;t yet clarify what sort of pinch controls or gestures accompany the stem design. As the publication notes, conventional controls could be seen in the upcoming Galaxy Buds, which are very similar to Apple AirPods or the more recent "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review">Ear</a>" buds from Nothing. </p>

<p>Firstly, these pinch controls on the Galaxy Buds 3 series could be customizable, to say the least. For instance, double pinching the stem on the Earbuds can skip or forward an audio track or decline an incoming call. Similarly, a single pinch would either accept the call to play a song or do both. Pinching and holding the stem can also trigger ANC, or users can assign other similar controls to their preferences.</p><p>Nonetheless, seeing a new change with the Galaxy Buds 3 series is encouraging if pinch controls turn out as expected. It would especially be refreshing for users coming from the Galaxy Buds 2 series or models before them.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Pixel Camera is getting a new update that brings in new settings and exclusive features from the Pixel 8 Pro to other Pixel phones.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/17/pixel-camera-9-4-update/">9to5Google</a>, the new changes with the latest Pixel camera app update bearing the <strong>9.4.103.641377609.23</strong> version start with the ability to choose a specific lens to capture a shot, as previously seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. Older Pixel phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a>, Pixel 6 Pro, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> will now have the feature tucked under the “Lens Selection, “ which provides Auto or Manual options.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Lens Selection is now buried under the Photo Settings section in the camera app, which is split into two tabs: General and Pro — a new addition as part of the latest update rollout.</p><p>The other interesting change is the replacement of the zoom buttons right above the shutter button. Instead of 1x or 2x buttons, Pixel users will now get to see UltraWide (UW), Wide (W), and Telephoto (T) options, making it easier for beginners to differentiate. The primary camera for the respective device will launch as default (W) whenever users open the camera app.</p>

<p>The RAW/ JPEG picker, previously hidden in the Advanced Settings section, has also been moved to the new Pro tab. However, like the Pixel 8 Pro, other Pixel owners won’t be able to select the Resolution for the image, notes 9to5. </p><p>Similarly, the “Store video efficiently” settings are also shifted to <strong>Settings> Video</strong> under Video Stabilization and Audio Zoom toggles.

<p>Oura was founded in 2013, and for the past 10 years, we’ve seen the company aggressively pursue its competitors since it holds many patents in the smart ring industry. Right after the Galaxy Ring was announced, the company was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-responds-galaxy-ring-announcement">quick to remind</a> Android Central that it has “100 granted patents, 270 pending patent applications, and 130+ registered trademarks.”</p><p>Oura argues that some of its competitors have infringed on its patents, involving aspects of design, functionality, and more. In March, it filed an ITC lawsuit against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman</a>, RingConn, and Circular for patent infringement.</p><p>“Unfortunately, when we see companies take shortcuts that imitate and ride the coattails of our innovation, we have no choice but to take action,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-files-itc-action-for-patent-infringement/">said</a> Tom Hale, Oura’s now-CEO.</p><p>Hale goes on to say that, having spent over a decade investing in the research and development of the ring and engineering it into its hardware and software, Oura will continue to protect the efforts it took to reach where they are today.</p><p>Samsung, fully aware it might be next in line to get sued for its highly anticipated Galaxy Ring, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-sues-oura-to-prevent-galaxy-ring-patent-challenge">filed a lawsuit against Oura Health Oy</a> at the San Francisco Division District Court on May 30. The lawsuit claims that Oura’s pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement could actually pose a risk to the success of Samsung’s upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-silver-close.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, has no comment on the likelihood of Samsung winning the lawsuit. However, he points out that he doesn’t see it as an offensive move to stifle competition. “Rather, I see it as a defensive move to ensure a fair fight.”</p><p>And reasonably so, considering Oura’s history. “Samsung’s suit does help paint itself in a better light as it appears to evangelize competition, while Oura, the underdog in the overall wearables market, is perceived as a monopoly,” Ubrani added.</p><p>The question, though, is more about the validity of some of Oura’s patents. Samsung argues that Oura’s patents cover features common to most smart rings, such as sensors, batteries, and data scores. However, if the court agrees on these aspects, Oura’s legal strategy could be weakened.</p><p>Despite this, Samsung asserts that the Galaxy Ring “has not infringed, and does not infringe, directly or indirectly, any valid and enforceable claim” from Oura’s five most commonly cited patents in its previous lawsuits.</p><p>Oura, on the other hand, has not publicly commented on Samsung’s lawsuit as of yet. The company did not respond to Android Central’s request for comments, either, but we will update this article once we have more information. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Yp7TetoRuQK8dJCY5XRDbM" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-colors.jpg" alt="Four Oura Rings in different finishes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yp7TetoRuQK8dJCY5XRDbM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1192" height="671" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oura was founded by Petteri Lahtela, Kari Kivela, and Markku Kosekela. Their vision was to create a functional and minimalistic wellness device. According to Petteri Lahtel, the brand’s early days weren’t easy, as securing funding proved difficult. </p><p>“It was really hard to find investors who were also driven by something else other than money. Our mission from day one has been to create a lasting impact by empowering individuals to learn how their bodies respond to their lifestyles,” he said in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbforum.com/nbreport/petteri-lahtela-what-i-learned-through-founding-oura-health/">interview</a> with Nordic Business Report. </p><p>While they continued to struggle for funding, they launched a Kickstarter campaign and publicized their concept in 2015. The company has since created three generations of its smart ring, the latest of which is its most popular and has solidified Oura as a leader in the space. Throughout these years, the focus on data accuracy and user empowerment has powered the ring since 2021.</p><p>“That’s how we stand out against other wearables—Oura Ring is designed not just for a moment in time or a season, but it’s meant to be a personal health companion for life,” Jason Russell, Oura’s VP of consumer software product, told me in an email.</p><p>From creating rings that could only track sleep and fitness to getting breakthroughs in women’s reproductive health research, including the capability of Oura Ring to track menstrual cycles and identify pregnancy, it has come a long way.</p><p>When discussing new players entering the smart ring market, Russel said that Oura has always welcomed “increasing competition as validation for the category’s potential.” However, to the contrary, whenever a company tries to enter the smart ring market, Oura has sued it for patent infringement, likely protecting years of innovation and user-centric design. </p><p>“With over a decade of experience in the industry, we’ve established ourselves as pioneers in the ring form factor, setting a high standard for innovation and accuracy, and we continue to innovate,” he added. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk" name="Court-gavel-lawsuits.jpg" alt="Court Gavel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Oura wins its lawsuits and competitors are forced to alter or retract their designs, consumers will have fewer options when choosing a smart ring. Oura would likely monopolize the smart ring market and restrict consumers&apos; ability to find a better ring that matches their budget and needs.  </p><p>"As a pioneer in the space, Oura has every right and reason to protect their moat, particularly as a giant like Samsung introduces a competing product," Ubrani added.</p><p>Secondly, going after competitors could only lead to a potential price rise, limiting accessibility to customers. It might even discourage other companies from investing in the innovation of these niche wearables, which could stifle the growth of smart ring tech. However, considering the legal system&apos;s complexity, it is important to note that these lawsuits might take years to resolve.</p><p>Oura might argue that these lawsuits help maintain the quality of products and prevent companies from infringing on their patents. </p><p>However, Ubrani says in reality, "these lawsuits and protectionist moves ultimately hurt the consumer because it reduces competition and instead, on some occasions." Instead, Oura should focus on improving its products and services to stand out in the market rather than chase after its competitors.</p>

Os tenemos que contar novedades sobre el #realmeGT6 💛 Os pedimos disculpas. pic.twitter.com/g5gtvA5ff2<a href="https://twitter.com/realmeespana/status/1801524985108070454">June 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Despite ongoing recovery efforts, the shipment&apos;s location is still unknown. Due to the theft, the launch of the mid-range smartphone in Spain has been delayed.</p><p>The Realme GT 6&apos;s launch in Spain was initially set for June 20 with a coordinated rollout in physical stores, but it has now hit a major snag. The theft of the first shipment has seriously disrupted the planned rollout in the country.</p><p>Realme Spain, citing uncontrollable external factors, admitted it couldn&apos;t recover the stolen devices. The incident highlights the vulnerabilities in global supply chains, especially for high-value electronics.</p><p>Ahead of its launch, the phone&apos;s key specs have surfaced, indicating that the Realme GT 6 packs a punch with a few solid features: a 6.78-inch 120Hz display that hits 6,000 nits of peak brightness, a massive 5,500mAh battery supporting 120W fast charging, and a powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 processor</a>. Users can pick between 8GB or 12GB of RAM and storage options ranging from 128GB to 512GB.</p><p>We might also see a 50MP main camera with OIS and a Sony-LYT808 sensor, a 50MP telephoto shooter with 2x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultra-wide camera, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_gt6_price_memory_options_in_europe_leak_ahead_of_launch-news-63314.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>.</p><p>Besides the shipping issues, the GT 6 theft poses a reputational challenge for Realme. To overcome this setback, Realme will need to focus on securing future shipments and maintaining strong customer trust.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster posted an alleged rendering of Samsung's Galaxy Ring charging case on Weibo, showcasing its small, ring box-like design.</li><li>It seems consumers will need to place their Ring in the center of the device, around the raised portion, to begin charging.</li><li>The Galaxy Ring's FCC listing teased a charging "cradle," though it was only seen in a mockup from underneath.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s first smart ring continues to generate excitement, and the latest leak may have spilled its charging case.</p><p>Known tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/Oji4m2Qqm?pagetype=viewer">Ice Universe</a> posted a supposed rendering of the Ring&apos;s charging case on Weibo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/16/samsung-galaxy-ring-charging-case-leak/">9to5Google</a>). At first glance, the case looks similar to a ring box you&apos;d spring open when the time is right. RingConn also has a similar ring case for its smart ring.</p><p>Internally, it seems consumers will nestle their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> around the raised portion with the expected contact pins for charging purposes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:670px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:89.55%;"><img id="ugfBPmTe8MKemhiHzndASg" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-charging-case-supposed-rendering.jpg" alt="A supposed look at the Galaxy Ring's charging case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ugfBPmTe8MKemhiHzndASg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="670" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is another, slightly larger circle surrounding the Galaxy Ring in the image which could be some form of charging indicator. Most cases like this, especially for earbuds, offer some type of indicator to let you know your device is charging appropriately.</p><p>Samsung might opt for an in-device indicator as you set the Ring around the raised portion before closing. Aside from the case&apos;s supposed design, we&apos;re still left wondering about more concrete information about its specifications.</p><p>At the end of May, the Galaxy Ring appeared for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-fcc-listing-cradle-specs-confirmed">its FCC certification</a>, which revealed its specifications in terms of available sizes and battery capacities. However, that listing also gave a vague mockup drawing of the charging "cradle" from underneath. Available information in the listing stated that Samsung would label each "cradle" with the appropriate ring size a consumer purchased.</p><p>The mockup also detailed where a user would plug in the USB charging cable to top up its internal battery. The FCC showed that the Galaxy Ring will arrive in ring sizes ranging from five to 12.</p><p>In other news, the Galaxy Ring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">was rumored</a> to feature quite a healthy battery life of nearly 10 days. Samsung Electronics President Roh Tae-moon confirmed this fact during the Ring&apos;s showcase at MWC 2024. So, with that in mind, it remains to be seen if users can carry around this Galaxy Ring case or if it&apos;s something that remains static at home.</p>

<hr>
<p>It&apos;s an exciting time for Motorola foldable enjoyers as the company confirms they&apos;re on the way—and quite soon, too.</p><p>Motorola posted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MotorolaUS/status/1802702833768079662">a quick video</a> on X, confirming that its next wave of foldables will launch on June 25 in the U.S. Unfortunately, Moto doesn&apos;t give us a clear view of the design of its Razr devices in the short teaser. What&apos;s easily discernable is that one variant (at least) will feature orange and blue colorways.</p><p>It also seems as though a vegan leather backing is to be expected on the devices.</p><p>The teaser continues, briefly showing several more colorways for its 2024 Razr phones, such as pink and maybe a cafe-brown option.</p><p>The good news is that we&apos;re only a week (and a day) away from seeing the Razr and Razr Plus 2024 in totality.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Motorola put its higher-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus</a> on the shelves <em>before </em>the cheaper Motorola Razr 2023 hit the market later in the year. It&apos;s unclear if the company will follow the same trend again this year or if consumers can grab both devices simultaneously, as that would be a quick turnaround for the more affordable variant.</p><p>Regardless, there&apos;s been some rumors that suggest Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-price-configuration-leak">might not increase</a> the prices of its Razr foldables. It was discovered through a European listing that the Razr Plus could see a €1200 price tag, which is similar to its predecessor. Moreover, the device could get a larger RAM/storage option for the same price, with rumors suggesting a 12GB+512GB configuration.</p><p>Other news suggests Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-series-renders-reveal-cover-screen-changes">is going all in</a> on the bigger cover screens by boosting its Plus variant to 4 inches and giving its base model a larger 3.6-inch cover. The latter is the same size as the cover display on the 2023 Razr Plus.</p><p>The Plus variant is expected to debut with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, a 165Hz refresh rate on its cover display, and a 6.9-inch OLED internal screen. The base Razr model could see MediaTek&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300</a> series chip with a 4,200mAh battery.</p>

After the trial period wraps up, you can either cancel your subscription or pay $12.95 per month (or $98 for an annual plan).

<p>Anonymous asks:</p><p><em><strong>Does using a cell phone increase the chance of cancer? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh boy, it&apos;s that time again. This question comes up every once in a while after some paper or publication questions the link between phone use and cancer rates. I&apos;ve seen a recent one implying that a particular brand of phone is more dangerous because it emits radiation and ignores it. You should, too, because there are a few glaring errors, like incorrectly listing what doctors and governing bodies call a safe amount. But it is a valid question and worth discussing once one bogus claim is tossed aside.</p><p>Because I always front-load the basic answer, I&apos;ll defer to the FCC, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/wireless-devices-and-health-concerns">which states</a>:</p><p>"<em>According to the FDA and the World Health Organization (WHO), among other organizations, to date, there is no consistent or credible scientific evidence of health problems caused by the exposure to radio frequency energy emitted by cell phones.</em>"</p>
<p>As usual, though, the simple answer doesn&apos;t say it all. Nobody is saying there is <em>no</em> definite link between using a phone and cancer because it&apos;s impossible to know. What people at the CDC or WHO <em>do</em> know is that studies show the number of people who develop an illness has no evidence that phone use caused it.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Cell phones</a> communicate with other devices, like cell towers or Wi-Fi routers, using RF (Radio Frequency) waves. The frequency of these waves is about the same as over-the-air broadcast television or the low setting of a microwave oven. They&apos;re also non-ionizing, which is really important in this discussion.</p>
<p>Non-ionizing radiation is everywhere at a much greater frequency than your phone emits because visible light is everywhere. If you have enough light to see or there is enough light to feel the heat, you&apos;re awash in non-ionizing radiation.</p><p>This type of radiation does not emit enough energy to damage human DNA and cause cancer like higher-frequency UV rays or X-rays can. At an extreme level, RF waves can heat human tissue, but your phone is incapable of producing this much energy. </p>

<p>These are things science knows. Indisputable facts if you will. Using this knowledge we can say that using a phone is no more dangerous than being in the path of a television signal or being inside under a bright lamp. It&apos;s far less dangerous than being outside in the sun with no UV protection, which is a known cause of cancer.</p><p>The good news is that concern for our safety doesn&apos;t stop there. The amount of RF emission from a phone is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-why-is-fcc-certification-necessary">tested and regulated</a> before you can buy one.</p>
<p>Cell phone RF is measured as SAR, which stands for the Specific Absorption Rate, which is the amount of radiation absorbed by the body. Your phone gives off radiation that your body will absorb, and phone makers have to limit the amount to meet standards.</p><p>Different countries and governing bodies have different regulations, but in the U.S., the FCC lists the maximum limit of SAR as 1.6 watts per kilogram of body weight. A phone can&apos;t emit more than this amount under any conditions.</p>
<p>As the FCC notes, these tests can be misleading. A phone&apos;s listed SAR value is when the phone is operating for an extended period under its highest possible power. Your phone will never work this hard. A better, more accurate SAR value would be based on variables that can&apos;t be tested, so the FCC goes with the worst-case scenario.</p><p>For practical purposes, this means a phone with a lower listed maximum SAR rating could perform worse than one with a higher listing in your hand under certain conditions. Remember this when you look at lists saying which phones are "safest" based on SAR ratings.</p>
<p>This is what science knows and has tested, but there is still more work to be done. Cell phone usage is a relatively new phenomenon. We don&apos;t have hundreds of years of historical data to compare, so we need to keep looking. Currently, nobody can find an actual link between phone use and cancer—but that doesn&apos;t mean nobody ever will.</p><p>If you want to be safe, nobody will fault you. Use the speakerphone or text instead of making a call. In the meantime, know that almost everything you see linking illness and phone use doesn&apos;t jibe with what the experts and scientists who study it every day have to say on the matter.</p>
