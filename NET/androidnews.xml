Both companies make what's known as "XR Glasses," an evolution from smart display glasses that aim to put a giant virtual screen in front of your eyeballs anywhere you go.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-1s-brings-1200p-visuals-and-a-lower-price-to-the-best-ar-glasses">Xreal 1S</a> just debuted at CES, a follow-up to the excellent Xreal One released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">last February</a>. Its upgrades over Xreal One include a 100-nit brighter micro-OLED display, 2g lighter weight, a new real-time 2D-to-3D conversion mode, and a $50 lower price tag. But Xreal's biggest competition, Viture, is ready to spice the market up with The Beast, the company's first pair of XR glasses with a dedicated spatial computing chip inside.</p><p>That enables Viture Beast to perform native 3DoF tracking, something that was only previously possible with the company's Spacewalker software on a computer or smartphone. Viture Beast is $100 more than Xreal 1S, but it also packs in a camera and compatibility with the wider Viture ecosystem. Which comes out on top? Let's take a closer look.</p><h2 id="spatial-tracking-and-3d-conversion-2">Spatial tracking and 3D conversion</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Geij4t6EU8xDUnDpoutCoj" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-side-lenses" alt="Xreal 1S and Viture Beast from the sides, showing the difference in lens tech when prescription lenses are installed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Geij4t6EU8xDUnDpoutCoj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the reasons I preferred Xreal One over <em>every</em> other pair of XR glasses on the market last year was its native 3DoF spatial tracking. Xreal 1S uses the same X1 chip as Xreal One and Xreal One Pro, so you can expect the same excellent, stable virtual monitor experience that those glasses delivered.</p><p>Viture Beast marks the first time Viture offers a pair of XR glasses with the same capability, but Viture's implementation isn't quite as reliable. To get the best performance, you need to have your glasses sitting undisturbed for 10 seconds after you plug them in for the sensors to calibrate. Xreal 1S doesn't need this to achieve the same stability. Viture told me it's working on better 3DoF stability, but for now, this area is a clear win for Xreal.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

this capability isn't enabled. Xreal 1S can perform 6DoF tracking <em>today</em> when you pop an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-pro-and-xreal-eye-deliver-a-new-vision-for-smart-glasses">Xreal Eye</a> camera into the slot on the underside of the glasses, and it doesn't need any extra software to do it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="btVzzXUW8v49AnDj6VBeNH" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-osd-menu" alt="Comparing the OSD menus on the Xreal 1S and Viture Beast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/btVzzXUW8v49AnDj6VBeNH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This same concept extends to the new Real 3D tech introduced on Xreal 1S. Real 3D uses the X1 chip and an AI algorithm to convert <strong>all</strong> 2D content to 3D in real time at 30FPS. That means any game console suddenly becomes a Nintendo 3DS, and all movies and videos immediately have depth. All you have to do is enable Real 3D in the glasses OSD menu.</p><p>Last summer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-immersive-3d-video">I tested</a> Viture's Immersive 3D tech, which has been available on its glasses via the company's Spacewalker software. The results are impressive and run better than Xreal's Real 3D solution, but that's because it's running on a computer or smartphone instead of the glasses.</p><p>This also means Viture's Immersive 3D is more limited than Xreal's Real 3D, as it can only convert <em>some</em> content on compatible devices. Xreal does everything in-glasses, albeit at a reduced framerate, although Xreal says performance improvements are coming in a future firmware update.</p><h2 id="display-quality-comfort-and-fov-2">Display quality, comfort, and FoV</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bumkm3JBwefYxNcayvVa3W" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-aspect-ratio" alt="Comparing aspect on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S running Hogwarts Legacy on a Steam Deck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bumkm3JBwefYxNcayvVa3W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's an area where things aren't quite so clear-cut. Starting with comfort, I've found that Viture Beast's display is more comfortable at high brightness, while Xreal maintains better comfort at medium to low brightness. Both glasses run at a 120Hz refresh rate with a 120Hz dimming rate. Viture's superior comfort at high brightness comes from the use of DC dimming, but the glasses switch to PWM dimming below 80% brightness.</p><p>Xreal 1S uses a hybrid of DC dimming and PWM dimming across the entire brightness spectrum. If you're not aware, OLED pixels are self-lit but always have to refresh their light every refresh cycle. Some companies use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> to manage this brightness change, but PWM dimming causes headaches, nausea, and other health problems in some people (like me).</p><p>I'm not sure I'd recommend either pair of glasses to flicker-sensitive people because of this. Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/viture-luma-ultra-hands-on-and-limited-edition-cyberpunk-smart-glasses">Viture Luma</a> line is better, as they use DC dimming across the entire brightness range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="55d6FmjUM6XsfbJUnU4WvV" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-dimming" alt="Comparing dimming methods on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/55d6FmjUM6XsfbJUnU4WvV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal is using traditional birdbath optics on the 1S, while Viture is employing what it calls "a hybrid approach combining both birdbath and waveguide." Viture's lenses offer a slightly wider FoV at the expense of some clarity at the left and right edges of the screen. Both Xreal 1S and Viture Beast support a range of prescription lenses. I've got my prescription attached to both, which you can see in the photos.</p><p>In general, I've found that Xreal 1S's display is better for productivity. Things like spreadsheets are simply clearer on the Xreal 1S, and text is generally more legible. Viture Beast's display offers punchier colors, deeper contrast, and slightly higher resolution at 1200p compared with Beast's 1080p. Viture will offer 1200p in a future firmware update, but for now, Xreal is slightly higher resolution because of the taller 16:10 aspect ratio.</p><p>I preferred using Viture Beast for entertainment purposes because of the color tuning on the display. Both glasses offer various color options, but Viture's punchier colors look nicest to me for games and movies.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LLGTTvxgZmiAcPN8Vqtv2W" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-sunlight-visibility" alt="Comparing sunlight visibility on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S with the electrochromic film maxed out" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LLGTTvxgZmiAcPN8Vqtv2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In my testing, Viture Beast offers full 120Hz performance on its glasses, while Xreal 1S seems to top out at 90Hz. Viture Beast defaults to 60Hz, but you can quickly switch to 120Hz in the display settings menu on the glasses.</p><p>Viture's display is also notably brighter than Xreal, something that's often coveted for games and movies. But while the screen tech itself is brighter, Xreal 1S is actually easier to see in any lighting, thanks to a darker electrochromic film implementation on Xreal's lenses.</p><h2 id="a-wearable-monitor-2">A wearable monitor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7oFC7hq9v3VCTPDYNWtXwV" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-maximim-screen-size" alt="Comparing maximum screen size on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7oFC7hq9v3VCTPDYNWtXwV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my favorite things about the Xreal One line is that it offers an OSD menu like a proper monitor. Viture Beast now offers a similar monitor, and while it doesn't offer quite as many options as Xreal, Viture is planning on expanding this menu's options in future updates.</p><p>Viture also offers more buttons on the glasses, giving you more ways to quickly adjust things like brightness, electrochromic dimming, volume, and even display size. Xreal requires you to sift through menus a little more, and since it has half the number of buttons, you often have to cycle through options before finding the one you want.</p><p>Overall, Xreal offers better value and more stability than Viture at this time. Both companies have offered superb support and regular feature updates over the past few years, and both of these glasses will see substantial upgrades over time. But it's hard to argue with saving $100 by choosing Xreal, unless something in Viture's excellent ecosystem (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">Pro Mobile Dock</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller">8BitDo controller</a>) that often only works with Viture's own glasses.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="de506baa-f6ae-4e82-bf47-973e75d08676">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:56.26%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:12,l:323,cw:692,ch:692,q:80/ZfiazFocaNX233DMHPvWrJ.jpg' alt="Xreal 1S in blue"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Xreal</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">1S</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Xreal 1S is a powerful wearable monitor that puts a giant virtual screen inside of a sleek pair of smart glasses.

However, if neither of those methods works, the pairing process requires you to manually start again. That's now changing, as Google Home is adding a manual device search option.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-updated-device-setup-3634717/">Android Authority</a>, Google is rolling out an update that lets users manually search for third-party smart home devices directly within the app when QR-based or automatic pairing fails. The new screen shows a list of supported brands, along with a search bar that lets you quickly find your specific device and start the pairing process.</p><h2 id="google-home-now-lets-you-find-devices-manually-2">Google Home now lets you find devices manually</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4658px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.39%;"><img id="SXGL2zvimiKY4rKiSjGgyM" name="google-home-new-setup-process-search" alt="Google Home's new process for pairing a new device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SXGL2zvimiKY4rKiSjGgyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4658" height="2580" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The app now includes a new button called "Add a different way," which brings up a list of popular smart home device makers with a search bar at the top. Once you select a device, Google Home will again prompt you to pair it using a QR code or, if that doesn't work, manually enter the pairing code found on the device or its packaging.</p><p>The publication also notes that, for many devices, the new pairing flow includes images of the product you're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-google-home-multiple-users">about to set up</a>. This makes it easier to confirm you're pairing the correct device before continuing.</p><p>The feature appears to be rolling out widely with version 4.6.55.1 of the Google Home app. If you don't see the new pairing option yet, make sure you're running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app&hl=en">the latest version</a>. If it's still missing, it may be a server-side rollout, but since it's already live for some users, it should reach everyone soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Supposedly, Samsung has sought out a "new generation" of Gorilla Glass for the upcoming Ultra. At a hardware-level, it's been purported that this glass solves many issues that consumers typically reach for a screen protector for.</p><p>Issues such as reflection have reportedly been squashed with this new glass, as the Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature "anti-reflective coating" on its display. This might also be paired with "CoE non-polarized light technology." This would not only cut down on how reflective the phone's screen is, but it would also boost its brightness, which is where many OEMs have ventured.</p><p>We'll have to see how these rumors pan out when the Galaxy S26 Ultra launches alongside its other two siblings this year. However, the tipster adds that this Gorilla Glass will offer "tempered protection," though that's pretty much what we've come to expect.</p><h2 id="looking-to-make-good-on-the-ultra-name-2">Looking to make good on the Ultra name</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fSU6vsKNzczPrs8QnZXijh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-S25-Plus-display-holding-02" alt="Comparing the displays of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fSU6vsKNzczPrs8QnZXijh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other display upgrade (on a glass level) the tipster alleged was its "privacy film." Their post says this new privacy film will help reduce peepers trying to see what you're up to over your shoulder. This lines up with what we've been hearing for a few months now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-how-its-screen-will-hide-itself-from-snoops">and even recently in January</a>. A recent video was discovered, purporting that Samsung was going to implement its privacy screen tech through software <em>and </em>hardware.</p><p>The report claimed Samsung was looking to utilize Flex Magic Pixel OLED tech and AI to block a person from snooping from the side.</p><p>There's likely more to this than we realize, but, for now, rumors say Samsung will place this "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-shows-first-look-at-built-in-privacy-display">Privacy Display</a>" feature in its display settings.</p><p>Other Ultra-related rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/s26-ultra-colors-leaked">include its supposed colors</a>. The device could debut with cobalt violet and pink gold as its only new choices. Allegations say the Galaxy S26 could launch on February 25, 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If nothing else, I don't have to be quite as careful about how I handle the products, and that's true of the CMF Headphone Pro.</p><p>CMF started out as a Nothing sub-brand that's focused on affordability, but it's now its own entity, and that clear focus on value hasn't changed — thankfully. The Headphone Pro is its latest product, and just like it did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-convinced-nothings-cmf-buds-pro-2-are-the-only-budget-earbuds-worth-buying">Buds Pro 2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF phone</a>, the headset has an eye-catching design, and a slate of features that belie its asking price. The Headphone Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Headphone-Canceling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0FLK83CMY/">costs just $79 on Amazon U.S.</a>, and it's just as affordable in India, where it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/cmf-nothing-headphone-pro-hi-res-ldac-100hrs-playback-40db-anc-5min-8hrs-charge-40mm-driver-bluetooth-wired/p/itm1649a193aaa4b">available for ₹6,999 ($76)</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="VtZ8NvGGyKKCRKG54RYWkc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VtZ8NvGGyKKCRKG54RYWkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with everything else CMF makes, the Headphone Pro just doesn't look like a budget product. The design is meant to stand out, and it does that quite definitively — the Light Green model I'm using is great to look at, and if you need something with added flair, you can easily get orange interchangeable ear cushions.</p><p>That's the second part of what makes the Headphone Pro so distinctive: its modularity. You can switch out the ear cushions with just a twist, and CMF has plenty of styles that let you accessorize the headset with ease. I used several headsets in the past where it was possible to change the cushions, but it wasn't quite as easy as it was here.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4837px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="RCLHBTQJGXXZN294GUWFDc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RCLHBTQJGXXZN294GUWFDc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4837" height="2725" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="VSNaGZ9Cmu9qtMXFzD8yoc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VSNaGZ9Cmu9qtMXFzD8yoc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="he4XSKMjgFunoBemH6nUic" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/he4XSKMjgFunoBemH6nUic.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4405px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="6m7DRsTDnsAwGhk5EvHQic" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6m7DRsTDnsAwGhk5EvHQic.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4405" height="2481" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The ear cushions and headband have good padding, and while the design isn't vented, I didn't feel uncomfortable even with extended use. The headset is on the lighter side at 283g, and that weight is distributed well along the headband. It's all made out of plastic, but the build quality is good, and I didn't see any problems in the week I used the headset. If anything, the Headphone Pro looks better than most high-end headsets I used.</p><p>My favorite feature is the physical controls; this is why I use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Nothing Headphone 1</a> over costlier models, and it's exciting to see CMF continue that trend. You get the usual power button and dedicated control to invoke Google Gemini, and there's also a volume knob, and a bass slider on the left. Look, I prefer a balanced sound, but I'll admit that it's just fun to be able to boost the bass on a particular track just by using a physical slider.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5065px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Lrem4LfUx5KbrLhbToguNc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lrem4LfUx5KbrLhbToguNc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5065" height="2853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="JhoNYwomG9yYAn7986gdrc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JhoNYwomG9yYAn7986gdrc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5164px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5C9pDyNU2DSysJqXbLmssc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5C9pDyNU2DSysJqXbLmssc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5164" height="2909" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There are other niceties included: you get actual ANC, and while it doesn't quite hold up as well as my Bose headset, it does an effective job in most situations. You get spatial audio as well, along with Google's Fast Pair, and even a low-latency mode. Basically, there isn't much missing on the Headphone Pro.</p><p>The headset charges via USB-C, and it gets fast charging as standard — a five-minute charge gives you four hours of music playback. CMF touts a 100-hour battery, but that's with most features disabled; realistically, you'll see around 35 to 40 hours based on your usage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="P6w5WNmbM78LG7tcfSvDDc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P6w5WNmbM78LG7tcfSvDDc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also a 3.5mm port on the left, and you can connect the headset this way if you just want to plug in (there's a 3.5mm cable included). CMF bundles a cloth carrying bag, and the headset folds flat, so taking it around in a bag didn't prove to be much of a hassle.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Headphone Pro comes with the LDAC codec, so you should get high-res audio on most devices; if not, it switches over to AAC or SBC. I tested the headset with my Find X9 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro, and I didn't have any issues with connectivity or range whatsoever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7DvYjqom9tJSdP2DWaWauc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7DvYjqom9tJSdP2DWaWauc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the sound, the headset has custom 40mm drivers, and it has similar tuning as other CMF and Nothing products. The headset lends itself well to easy listening sessions, and while there's a slight bass exuberance, it doesn't bleed into the other frequencies, and on the whole, I really like how it sounds.</p><p>There really isn't a budget headset that sounds anywhere as refined as the Headphone Pro, and when you combine all the extras — the design, physical controls, and battery life — you're getting a product that's a downright steal. CMF is proving time and again that it knows how to deliver budget products you actually want to use, and the Headphone Pro is no different. I like it just as much as my Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, and the fun design, great sound, and modularity makes it an easy recommendation.</p><p>If you're in need of a new headset, don't bother looking at other brands — you should just get the CMF Headphone Pro.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fba0d4bf-45f8-40da-b025-febebbd1d73d">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Headphone-Canceling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0FLK83CMY" data-model-name="CMF Headphone Pro" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:99.67%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fhJY56HrgVEU7gKa98wufC.jpg' alt="CMF Headphone Pro"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">CMF Headphone Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Headphone Pro looks and sounds better than any other budget headset I used, and the interchangeable ear cushions add a playfulness that you don't see in this category. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Newly leaked images of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Pixel 10a</a> show a phone that looks almost identical to last year’s model, suggesting Google is sticking with a familiar design rather than trying something bold.</p><p>The newest renders, shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-pixel-10a-official-looking-images-leak-in-more-angles/" target="_blank">YTechB</a>, display the Pixel 10a from all sides. At first glance, it’s tough to tell this phone apart from last year’s version. As per the leaked renders, it still has the same pill-shaped camera bar that sits flat, unlike the raised visor on the flagship models, and keeps the even bezels that are typical for the A-series.</p><p>The sides of the phone don't seem to be changed either. The power and volume buttons are still on the same side, and the other edge remains smooth and simple.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4rig8dL8imA3W5WF7Q78i8" name="Google-Pixel-10a-leaked-renders" alt="Pixel 10a screen and back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rig8dL8imA3W5WF7Q78i8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YTechB)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PyDAuLpqJAj6Jiwt3FM3h8" name="Google-Pixel-10a-leaked-renders" alt="right side angle of the Pixel 10a showing the power and volume buttons and the screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyDAuLpqJAj6Jiwt3FM3h8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YTechB)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ajsrB3LKdaDHYzBMzn4Jf8" name="Google-Pixel-10a-leaked-renders" alt="right side angle of the Pixel 10a showing the power and volume buttons and the back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ajsrB3LKdaDHYzBMzn4Jf8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YTechB)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="one-potential-upgrade-2">One potential upgrade</h2><p>Inside, not much seems to be different, but there is one detail to note.

The price should stay at $499, making the 10a a reliable but cautious choice for joining the Google ecosystem.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The latter lets AI take over and tell callers you can't pick up, records their voicemail, and then transcribes it so you can quickly see what they said and decide how to respond.</p><p>While Take a Message sounds genuinely useful, it appears the feature has been behaving oddly over the past few months.

Google announces what's next for its in-depth AI Mode in Search.</p><p>Google introduced Personal Intelligence for AI Mode in Search earlier this morning (Jan 22) in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/personal-intelligence-ai-mode-search/">a Keyword post</a>. If you're familiar with what Google did with Gemini's version, you might know where this update's headed. The company teases that Personal Intelligence in AI Mode will help you "tap into your own personal context and insights to unlock even more helpful Search responses that are tailored to you."</p><p>This update concerns Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers as an "opt-in" feature, which is capable of linking AI Mode to your Google Photos and Gmail accounts. The post alludes to AI Mode's enhanced capabilities, as it won't simply "recommend" items based on interests alone. The company gives the example of searching for new sneakers. Since the user (in this example) had recently purchased a pair, AI Mode used that as fuel to find an alternative style.</p><p>Google offered another shopping example, stating Personal Intelligence in AI Mode will leverage your flight information (Gmail), as well as your destination, to find clothing ideas for you.</p><p>Traveling is another key highlight, with Google stating AI Mode will sift through your Cloud-stored Photos for captured memories from previous trips. If you've asked it to help you plan an enjoyable weekend away, it'll use that to suggest places you haven't been to yet or activities you probably didn't think of.</p><h2 id="ai-mode-s-wants-to-know-more-to-help-more-2">AI Mode's wants to know more to help more</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1074px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.87%;"><img id="gwHc9oerGR4K7b2DPZZmaK" name="google-search-ai-mode-trip-planning" alt="Personal Intelligence in AI Mode helps a user with a planning activities for an upcoming family trip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gwHc9oerGR4K7b2DPZZmaK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1074" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1071px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.02%;"><img id="TtCgGVMDgvcSpLccB9XkZK" name="google-search-ai-mode-personal-intelligence-clothing" alt="Personal Intelligence in AI Mode can dive into your Gmail for flight information and old purchases to help you discover clothing options for a trip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TtCgGVMDgvcSpLccB9XkZK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1071" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>AI Mode is an extension of its Gemini 3 software; however, Google says the feature will not use what it's used from Gmail and Photos for training.</p><p>This echoes what was said about Personal Intelligence in Gemini a week ago. The post adds that users "remain in control" with this feature in AI Mode. As previously stated, Personal Intelligence is an opt-in feature.

That's a cause for celebration. The legendary mobile provider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/family-plan-deal"><strong>just launched a promotion called the "Family Value" plan, a new unlimited tier that provides a ton of benefits with up to $1,000 in annual savings</strong></a> compared to rivals Verizon and AT&T. </p><p>The Family Value plan starts at $140 per month for three lines, which shakes out to around under 50 bucks per line. In addition to unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile's unrivalled 5G network, the new data plan gives you a five year price guarantee with an unlimited hotspot and free subscriptions to Netflix and Hulu. </p><h2 id="t-mobile-launches-new-family-value-plan-for-three-lines-or-more-2">T-Mobile launches new Family Value plan for three lines or more</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="c4b372de-ff3f-4585-ba3a-131bbfde5c06" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" data-dimension48="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/family-plan-deal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LyeCMKb3jYui876qcYpcrN" name="t-mobile logo square 1000x1000.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyeCMKb3jYui876qcYpcrN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>T-Mobile Family Value Plan:</strong> <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/family-plan-deal" data-dimension112="c4b372de-ff3f-4585-ba3a-131bbfde5c06" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" data-dimension48="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" data-dimension25=""><strong>save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&T</strong></a></p><p>T-Mobile is taking on the competition with a new plan that starts at just $140 per month for three lines. This family-friendly <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited plan</a> is all about bang for the buck, offering comprehensive coverage with a bounty of entertainment perks, international benefits, 30GB of high-speed data, and much more. Will this move encourage the rest of the Big Three to drop their prices? We'll see, but if you're looking to switch to T-Mobile, now's the time.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/family-plan-deal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c4b372de-ff3f-4585-ba3a-131bbfde5c06" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" data-dimension48="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><em><strong>See all the best deals at T-Mobile</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking to switch to T-Mobile and can bring at least three lines; you want a phone plan with a ton of streaming perks and other benefits.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-prepaid-carriers-buyers-guide">cheap data plan</a> without all of the bells and whistles; you're looking for a single-line wireless deal. </p><p>In addition to the benefits laid out above, the new Family Value plan guarantees a new phone upgrade every two years with continued access to all of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile/best-t-mobile-deals-of-the-month">T-Mobile's new customer offers</a>. To earn the most bang for the buck with T-Mo's new plan, you can also take advantage of T-Satellite and grab some discounts on tablets and smartwatch lines. The plan will even get you a subscription to Apple TV for only $3 per month, in addition to free access to Hulu and Netflix. </p><p>If you want to bring your existing phone to the carrier, T-Mobile is also offering up to $800 per line to switch. In the never-ending battle of the Big Three wireless carriers, T-Mobile is clearly out for blood. </p><p>On the other hand, although it beats the competition, $140 for three lines isn't exactly cheap. I wouldn't recommend switching to the Family Value plan unless you plan to take advantage of <em>all </em>of the benefits described here. If you simply want a straightforward data plan with talk, text, and data for the family, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a> that could get the job done for cheap. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Well, the OnePlus 15 doesn't have Qi2 charging support, there's no alert slider, and the AI features are a bit lacking compared to other modern flagships.

Sending in the OnePlus 13 or Galaxy S25 Ultra, for instance, will only land you $300 and $400 of credit, respectively, while devices like the Google Pixel 10 Pro will earn you the max amount.</p><p>Needless to say, it's worth using Best Buy's trade-in tool to see how much you can get. Play your cards right and you could get one of the year's best phones at a budget phone price, AND $100 of free Best Buy cash to use on whatever you'd like. Not too shabby for a device of this caliber, if you ask me.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>The average person living in the United States doesn't buy smartphones like people in most of the rest of the world. While you can buy an unlocked phone from great retailers like Amazon or Best Buy, the vast, vast majority of U.S. customers get their phones directly from carriers like T-Mobile, AT&T, or Verizon.</p><p>Because of this behavior, companies like OnePlus that don't play ball with carriers often find themselves on the losing side of market share in one of the world's largest smartphone markets. Whether or not you believe rumors that OnePlus is winding down its global presence, it's clear that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-isnt-going-away-but-it-may-not-have-quite-as-big-a-presence-in-2026">the company's market share has dwindled</a> over the years.</p><p>Thankfully, OnePlus has publicly declared that it's not calling it quits. Still, I worry about the potential, as OnePlus has been one of my safe havens as someone sensitive to flickering LEDs and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. OnePlus is the <em>only</em> company in the country making <strong>flagship phones</strong> that adhere to IEEE standards for LED flicker, and it's starting to feel a little like doomsday for folks like me.</p><h2 id="those-of-us-left-behind-2">Those of us left behind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WoDUXsxHeSJBnKw7QB3JdK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-13" alt="PWM settings on Miyoo Mini Plus and display settings on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WoDUXsxHeSJBnKw7QB3JdK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A few months ago, I was introduced to Harry Metzler, a musician based in New Jersey who has struggled with PWM sensitivity since contracting COVID in July 2022. After having to cancel a European tour for his band <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://linktr.ee/IllAdvised">Ill-Advised</a> following its seventh album release, Metzler realised his new iPhone was impossible to focus on, and certain LED lights actually caused his left eye to involuntarily shut.</p><p>That's about the time he found out about PWM dimming, a dimming method used by some LED lights, OLED displays, and other LED-based gadgets. Instead of dimming like a traditional light source, where voltage is simply reduced to produce a dimmer light output, LEDs that use PWM dimming rapidly turn on and off several hundred times per second to fool your brain into seeing a brighter or dimmer image.</p><p>The result is often described as "seizure-like" or "concussive" symptoms in people who suffer from sensitivity. Metzler finds that his iPhone 13 is currently the most comfortable model, partly owing to that phone's reduced brightness level when compared to newer iPhones.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OBNlC-VHN3o" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Apple's iPhone 17 family launched a new PWM-sensitive accessibility setting that helps some PWM-sensitive users, but it's not a be-all-end-all solution. Some phones, like the Google Pixel 10 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-display-interview">have taken up a similar idea</a>, but the fact of the matter is that these brands have been slow to make even small changes, while brands like OnePlus responded to problems with robust solutions years ago.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-display-review">OnePlus 15's display</a>, for example, is currently the most eye-friendly flagship OLED display you can buy in North America. The more budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-display-review">OnePlus 15R's display</a> is even better than that for flicker-sensitive people, and doesn't compromise quality to ensure all users can enjoy it.</p><p>But it's not just PWM dimming that's at fault, either. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">Temporal dithering</a> (TD) is another problem that's reared its head as 10 and 12-bit displays have become more commonplace, and it's causing just as many issues as PWM dimming for the same reason.</p><p>TD is a tactic used by manufacturers to artificially "deepen" colors on a display by flickering a pixel's colors back and forth, creating a color that doesn't exist by tricking your brain. This is often at 15-30FPS, the same flicker rate that causes epileptic seizures.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi" name="Best of 2025" alt="OnePlus phone launches 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Since my second COVID infection in 2024, I've been unable to use any Apple laptop," Metzler told me. The link between flicker sensitivity and COVID infection is something often correlated in the PWM-sensitive community, and I realized that my own sensitivity to PWM dimming also coincided with my first COVID infection. It's what led to led me to first write about how my phone was making me sick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">in May 2023</a>.</p><p>Metzler told me he realized his "eye twitching problem" was caused by dithering, which was introduced in a Mac OS update. He identified the problem by using a program called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.madrau.com/">SwitchResX</a> on his Mac, which forces the OS to stop using dithering. It helped solve Metzler's problem when using older Apple hardware, but newer laptops with M4 silicon no longer allow this setting.</p><p>OnePlus may not make laptops, but it does make several tablets and phones that don't employ dithering or low-Hz PWM dimming. It's a fact that means some users <em>must</em> use a non-Apple, Google, or Samsung-branded device, or be faced with debilitating health issues on a daily basis.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XASQHE3tpRwjHQ3oKSWJZe" name="oneplus-15-display-lock-screen-themes-03" alt="A themed lockscreen using the OnePlus 15's built-in Flux Themes engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XASQHE3tpRwjHQ3oKSWJZe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Metzler told me, "I've talked to the Apple Store management, and they've put me in touh with corporate, but it's just this round and round and round and round thing. And, I'm at the point where, you know, we just kind of feel like there's no choice but to bring awareness to this issue."</p><p>The biggest problem with both PWM dimming and temporal dithering is that you usually can't physically see these things in action — which is the entire reason they're implemented in such a way — and that means most people simply don't know they exist. People get headaches and other pain from their devices and don't understand why.</p><p>The glacial pace of evolution from the largest companies is a bad fit for users with specific needs, and that's where a company like OnePlus comes in.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.08%;"><img id="NnfDWvKLfcPHAFgVRCdnTU" name="OnePlus-and-Motorola-1" alt="The OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 15 with the Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NnfDWvKLfcPHAFgVRCdnTU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2288" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If OnePlus were to exit the market — again, particularly the U.S. market — it would mean the only real alternatives for flicker-sensitive people are Motorola, Nothing, or one of the many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-e-ink-android-phone-is-the-kindle-phone-ive-always-wanted">E Ink phones</a> that have entered the market over the past year. But none of those phones are flagship-level, and they all come with their own problems, as well.</p><p>Motorola doesn't offer some of its best flagships in the U.S., and Nothing has yet to launch a proper flagship phone. Each of the company's mid-range and entry-level phones is often great for PWM-sensitive people, but many of Motorola's LCD-based phones are a bad fit because they employ dithering. Likewise, while E Ink phones might be totally flicker-free thanks to E Ink technology, almost all use lower-end specs, at best.</p><p>My hope is that people like Metzler, who are stuck using Apple devices for job-related reasons, will soon see relief as companies like Apple and Samsung adopt tech from companies like OnePlus. We need these kinds of companies to stick around to serve potentially niche requirements, especially in this day and age, where daily life is quickly becoming impossible without a smartphone.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ed6e4c99-7f05-40d1-b4e1-d083717d83fd">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QKqNQi3z8gp3kkpLrjtcKk.jpg' alt="An official product render of the OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>OnePlus</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Want a beautiful display that won't hurt your eyes?

The company introduced the feature in beta for New Zealand subscribers; however, today (Jan 22), that's going to change. In a press release, Spotify confirms that it's starting to roll out its beta for these unique playlists in more markets for Premium users in the U.S. and Canada "by the end of the month."</p><p>Once this arrives, Premium users can open <strong>Spotify > Create > Prompted Playlist</strong>. That's when the platform says your creativity and musical interests begin to shine. Users can describe what they'd like to hear, using vibes and scenarios as fuel for their lyrical, musical interests.</p><p>Spotify's Prompted Playlist will generate its results based on your description. Additionally, if you're vibing with what you said, you can set that playlist to refresh its contents daily or weekly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="uj9jLofPGUEq74DDUnoF9L" name="spotify-prompted-playlist-chill-example" alt="Users can write a description in Spotify's Prompted Playlists and find notes about the songs and vibes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uj9jLofPGUEq74DDUnoF9L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a little more to Prompted Playlists. According to Spotify, once you've described what you want, its software will use "real-time information" from the music industry. The platform wants people to think of "trends, charts, culture, and history" when it comes to what makes up the industry.</p><p>More than that, Spotify takes into account your listening behavior from the moment your account first opened. This feature will resurface your favorite artists, but it will also turn you toward newer sounds and creators to widen your musical knowledge. Customization extends to users telling Spotify genres it loves and genres it would rather not hear, too.</p><p>Spotify says you're never locked into one avenue with Prompted Playlists. If, at any point, you're interested in a refresh, Spotify says you can "edit your prompt at any time or start fresh whenever inspiration hits." The company reiterates that the generated playlist will create a "one-liner" about why it put a particular song in that playlist. However, if your mind's looking to chill, Spotify has included "Ideas" to help get you going.</p><h2 id="more-music-lovers-are-in-2">More music-lovers are in</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="Midj5ZzE2qEMAYpP2f6A4L" name="spotify-prompted-playlist-album-cover" alt="Spotify's Prompted Playlists will create a cover and short explainer about what it contains." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Midj5ZzE2qEMAYpP2f6A4L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When this feature debuts in beta, users may notice a few example prompts on the app's home screen from music editors and experts.</p><p>While this expanded beta isn't expected to hit the U.S. and Canada until the end of January, Spotify says it's not closing out user feedback. With this expanded beta, Spotify is continuing its interest in listening to users to improve Prompted Playlists as much as possible before launching it fully. One thing is for certain: some aspects of the feature are bound to change, and Spotify may deploy "usage limits" during this test.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After using the phone for a while now, I got a much better idea of what Samsung is trying to achieve, and how the phone differs from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's tri-folding Mate XT</a> — which I've had for the better part of a year now.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold is on sale in South Korea and the UAE, where is costs anywhere between the equivalent of $2,500 to $3,200. Samsung is set to bring the Galaxy Z TriFold to the U.S. sometime later in Q1, and estimates suggest the foldable will cost over $2,600 in the country, inching closer to $3,000.</p><p>Obviously, that's a lot of cash, and if you just want a foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 does all the things you need, and coming in at $1,649, it is a decent value — in the context of the TriFold. But if you don't care about the price and just need the latest in what's possible with foldable tech, then yes, you should get the Galaxy Z TriFold. Samsung is only selling the foldable in limited quantities anyway, putting it squarely in the halo product category.</p><p>If you are considering the phone, I'll outline the reasons to do so, and where I think the tri-folding device doesn't quite measure up against regular book-style foldables or the Huawei Mate XT.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-reasons-to-buy"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Reasons to buy</span></h2><h2 id="the-tablet-sized-amoled-panel-is-great-to-use-2">The tablet-sized AMOLED panel is great to use </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jYDCtUxyAmTesEatH2N2Kb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYDCtUxyAmTesEatH2N2Kb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's just plain cool to be able to take a phone and unfurl it into a 10-inch panel. That novelty doesn't really go away, and having a tablet-sized panel that you can use anywhere is just great. The AMOLED panel gets bright and it's just as good to use as the inner panel on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and I didn't see any issues with pixel density, color vibrancy, or brightness.</p><p>On that note, the outer 6.5-inch AMOLED panel is identical to what you get on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and it is just as usable. Initially, I wasn't quite sold on the idea that the outer panel moves to the back of the device when the TriFold is fully unfolded, but it is a natural way to unfurl the foldable, and outside of the panel getting a few smudges when using the device fully unfolded, there are no issues.</p><h2 id="there-are-no-issues-with-the-hardware-or-durability-2">There are no issues with the hardware — or durability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EipNTDQnPjdPmuxxLnxcxa" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EipNTDQnPjdPmuxxLnxcxa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll admit that I used the Huawei Mate XT quite carefully because I was constantly worried I would break the outer panel, but because of the U-style foldout design of the Galaxy Z TriFold, the inner panel isn't exposed. This gives the tri-folding device much better durability, and the hinges are just as fluid as the Z Fold 7, and I didn't notice any inconsistencies with the hardware design.</p><p>Basically, the Galaxy Z TriFold feels just as long-lasting as the Z Fold 7, and it is just as thin when fully unfolded. That's another area where Samsung did all the right things; even though the TriFold is heavier at 309g, the weight is distributed evenly along the chassis, and it isn't noticeable. It is chunky when you're just using the outer panel, but again, not so much that you're going to regularly notice.</p><p>I also like that Samsung is using the same cameras as the Z Fold 7 — that makes the TriFold just as good in this area. And with a 5,600mAh battery, it should last at least a day. I used it for the better part of 30 minutes, so I'm not going to make any judgements on the battery, but it's great to see a big battery on one of Samsung's foldables. If anything, that's reason alone to get the TriFold.</p><h2 id="the-software-is-a-clear-winner-2">The software is a clear winner</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Jcj9BCzMwizR8o83SBasKb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jcj9BCzMwizR8o83SBasKb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest reason to consider the Galaxy Z TriFold is the software. It has the same great software as the Z Fold 7, and Samsung has features that let you maximize the 10-inch real estate. The productivity and multitasking features are better than what you get on most other foldables, and this is an area where Samsung has a lead.</p><p>It's also just as straightforward to use as any other Samsung phone, and this is where the TriFold wins out against the Mate XT. I had to do quite a bit of work to customize the foldable and have all of my utilities set up on the device, but with the TriFold, there are no such limitations.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-reasons-not-to-buy"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Reasons not to buy</span></h2><h2 id="the-panel-is-highly-reflective-2">The panel is highly reflective</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jYDCtUxyAmTesEatH2N2Kb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYDCtUxyAmTesEatH2N2Kb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As much as I like the inner panel on the Galaxy Z TriFold, it is quite reflective — this is noticeable when you're viewing content on the device. I didn't notice it as much on my Z Fold 7, but the increased real estate makes it more evident on the TriFold, and that's something to consider if you're thinking of getting this just to stream TV shows and movies on the go.</p><h2 id="it-isn-t-as-versatile-2">It isn't as versatile</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LqoQjyE2mm7LNgH7AUajMb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LqoQjyE2mm7LNgH7AUajMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another point of contention is that the TriFold doesn't close into a traditional book-style foldable like the Mate XT. You get the outer panel, and then the inner panel unfolds to the full 10 inches. The design of the hinges means there's no way to close one side of the panel and use it as a book-style foldable much like the Z Fold 7, so you lose out on that feature.</p><p>I find myself using the Mate XT in this mode quite often, so not having that on the TriFold is a limitation.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-should-you-buy-it"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="922tLzY9DVjVNeUPrZ9ACb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/922tLzY9DVjVNeUPrZ9ACb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Look, deciding to go with the Galaxy Z TriFold isn't going to be objective — I can list all the pros and cons, but ultimately, this is a foldable that's close to $3,000; I understand that my thoughts on the foldable will do little to convince you to buy one. If you're undecided and need validation that the foldable is a legitimate daily driver and not just a tech demo, then yes, the TriFold should be your next phone.</p><p>Similar to other halo products like the GeForce RTX 5090, deciding to go with the Galaxy Z TriFold will come down to preference. If you're a tech enthusiast and want a phone that stands out from everything else available today, the TriFold is an unmatched choice. Or if you've used several Samsung products in the past and have an affinity to the brand, the TriFold is an easy draw. The tri-folding device is better than what I thought it would be, and whether you want to buy one or not is entirely down to you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

At the center of the update are two things everyone’s been asking for — a truly customizable multiview experience and cheaper subscription options launching in early 2026.</p><p>Multiview on YouTube TV has been around since 2023, originally launched as a way for sports fans to watch multiple games at once. Initially, it was locked to a small set of channels and mostly focused on sports, but last year, users could start <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-is-bringing-custom-multi-views-and-a-redesign-to-its-tv-app">building their own multiview windows with non-sports channels</a> as well.</p><p>Now, YouTube's CEO Neal Mohan <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/the-future-of-youtube-2026/" target="_blank">said</a> the service is expanding this feature even more. Soon, you’ll be able to mix and match up to four channels on one screen, whether you want to watch news, sports, entertainment, or anything else.</p><p>This is great for households with different viewing preferences, like soccer fans and reality show lovers, or for anyone who wants to watch several games at once without switching apps.</p><p>The new customizable multiview shows that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> is giving users more control. Allowing people to choose their own layout may help the service stand out from traditional cable bundles.</p><h2 id="cheaper-options-are-coming-2">Cheaper options are coming</h2><p>YouTube TV is also changing its pricing and plans. Instead of one large plan for everyone, it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/choice-arrives-with-youtube-tv-plans-early-next-year-but-heres-the-sports-plan">offer over 10 different packages</a> based on genres, starting early next year.</p><p>Currently, the base plan costs about $82.99 per month and includes over 100 channels, unlimited DVR, and features like multiview and key plays. However, some people have criticized this all-or-nothing approach, especially as streaming prices rise.</p><p>The new genre-based plans aim to solve this problem. You’ll be able to choose bundles focused on sports, news, family, or entertainment.</p><p>YouTube hasn’t shared exact prices yet, but early leaks suggest these packages will likely cost much less than the full base plan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the original post, this anti-rollback procedure or "fuse" applies to OnePlus phones featuring a Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. More specifically, this applies to the company's recent v16.0.3.501 ColorOS update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">OnePlus 13</a>, 13T, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">15</a>.</p><p>The user details a few "consequences" for attempting a downgrade or rollback. Their post states that this OS update makes it impossible for users to rollback, as their device will undergo a "hard brick." This will reportedly occur if the user tries to flash a previous version of ColorOS, OxygenOS, or even a custom ROM.</p><p>Custom ROMs are the other side of this, which, while it doesn't affect a majority of Android users, some get down with the ROMs. The user reports that after the 16.0.3.501 ColorOS update, flashing any ROM will brick your device, and "you cannot unbrick" the phone. The thread highlights one OnePlus 13 user who had to obtain a new motherboard just to be able to use their device again.</p><p>The developer suggests dodging the 16.0.3.501 update if your device receives it. Of course, this only applies to users who actively use custom ROMs and may be interested in rollbacks, but this is where things get hazy. The developer reports that this anti-rollback mechanism has only been applied to OnePlus' ColorOS, not newer OxygenOS versions. Users overseas, such as in the U.S., will have the latter, but there's nothing that says OnePlus isn't going to apply this mechanism to OxygenOS, too.</p><h2 id="changes-at-oneplus-2">Changes at OnePlus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xnKkvqZJtcrkRNJEqCU93b" name="oneplus-15-display-home-screen-01" alt="A customized home screen UI on the OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xnKkvqZJtcrkRNJEqCU93b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus has been all over the headlines recently, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/allegations-claim-the-oneplus-16-might-give-global-markets-the-cold-shoulder">there was one rumor</a> about its upcoming 16 flagship model.

On <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/RobinLiuOnePlus/status/2013829249690751486">social media</a>, the company's CEO of OnePlus India, Robin Liu, said, "I wanted to address some misinformation that has been circulating about OnePlus India and its operations.  We’re operating as usual and will continue to do so. Never Settle." It also seems as though OnePlus is restructuring its mentality, looking toward a future where it shies away from multiple launches to focus on "crucial devices."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung kicked things off with the Galaxy S25 Edge, Apple took the trend one step further with the iPhone Air, and TECNO provided its own take with the Spark and Pova Slim. Now, Motorola is entering the space with the Motorola Edge 70, and it's impressive.</p><p>Motorola's Edge 70 is a slim phone for those who want to dip their toes into the water of thin smartphones. It's not the thinnest, but it also comes with fewer compromises. It's not the most powerful, but it's also not as expensive. So, how does the Motorola Edge 70 compare to the iPhone Air? While it's hard for any phone maker to beat the design marvel that is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-edge-70-ultra-looks-like-it-wants-to-stand-on-premium-in-this-leak">Motorola Edge 70</a> does as good a job as any competitor.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-70-vs-iphone-air-design-and-display-2">Motorola Edge 70 vs. iPhone Air: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1379px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="FLmVSwovN3Nh6HTfTRuAiM" name="Motorola-Edge-70-pantone-cloud-dancer" alt="The Motorola Edge 70 in Pantone Cloud Dancer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FLmVSwovN3Nh6HTfTRuAiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1379" height="775" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With thin phones, it's important to understand that the advertised thickness refers to the overall body, not the camera bump. This applies to both the Motorola Edge 70 and the iPhone Air. The former comes with a thick, squircle-shaped camera platform on the top-left portion of the back of the phone. Meanwhile, the iPhone Air has a "camera plateau" that extends across the topmost section of the back of the phone. Both camera bumps are significantly thicker than the rest of these thin phones.</p><p>The iPhone Air is more compact than the Motorola Edge 70 overall, since the latter has a larger display. This makes the overall dimensions taller, with the Edge 70 measuring 159 x 74 x 5.99mm. The iPhone is shorter and thinner, but slightly wider, measuring 156.2 x 74.7 x 5.64mm. Both phones fall under the 6mm mark, though the iPhone Air is decisively thinner. When phones get this thin, the marginal differences in thickness matter more than you think.</p><p>Apple uses a titanium frame for the iPhone Air. It's the only iPhone to use titanium this year, and it's crucial here to add strength while keeping the chassis lightweight. Otherwise, the phone is a glass slab with Ceramic Shield on both sides. Motorola is using its classic materials for the back cover of the Edge 70, using plastic, fabric, or faux leather in place of traditional glass. In this case, buyers can choose between four PANTONE colorways on the Motorola Edge 70.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QzoDEMQmfXQxZiXCzLaZ24" name="iPhone-Air-7" alt="The back of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QzoDEMQmfXQxZiXCzLaZ24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notably, Motorola has the design advantage in two key areas.

The Gorilla Glass 7i cover glass on the front of the Motorola Edge 70 is weaker than the iPhone Air's Ceramic Shield, however.</p><p>The iPhone Air sports a 6.5‑inch OLED display supporting 120Hz variable refresh rates and 3,000 nits of peak brightness. By comparison, the Motorola Edge 70 offers a 6.67-inch pOLED screen with 4,500 nits of peak brightness and a maximum 120Hz refresh rate. However, Motorola didn't use LTPO, so its refresh rates are locked to preset tiers.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-70-vs-iphone-air-hardware-and-specs-2">Motorola Edge 70 vs. iPhone Air: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YPpYwp5Qe6U9kv2sF5QMKe" name="Motorola-Edge-70-green" alt="green colorway of the Motorola Edge 70 showing the rear panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPpYwp5Qe6U9kv2sF5QMKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola Poland)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the inside, the scales tip in favor of the iPhone Air.

If you're in the U.S. like me, you can't buy the Motorola Edge 70, so your choice is limited to those two options. That's a real shame, because I tend to like Motorola's take on an ultra-slim smartphone. While it's not the thinnest phone on the market, it is one of the lightest options at just 159 grams, making it lighter than both the iPhone Air and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.</p><p>That quality alone is enough to grab my attention. There are other perks too, like IP69 protection against high-pressure and high-temperature water jets — something we don't often see on any phone, let alone a thin one. It also addresses some of the iPhone Air's deficiencies by offering a dual rear camera system and stereo speakers.</p><p>We can't ignore the Motorola Edge 70's shortcomings, though. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 processor powering the smartphone is unimpressive and likely won't age well. The phone is also only guaranteed to get three years of major Android OS upgrades.

This parameter isn't foolproof, but that's secondary to OpenAI's confirmation that Age Prediction will "help estimate whether an account likely belongs to someone under 18." Your "stated age" is taken into account by the AI; however, OpenAI states its model will also consider the time you're typically active, as well as "usage patterns."</p><p>Now, what is all of this for? If ChatGPT determines that the user is (potentially) under the age of 18, it will reduce that person's exposure to sensitive content. Such content includes graphic violence, viral challenges that could pose a health risk, depictions of self-harm, and more.</p><p>ChatGPT will also limit content concerning "extreme beauty standards, unhealthy dieting, or body shaming." The innerworkings of ChatGPT's Age Prediction is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-age-verification-failing">similar to what Google did on YouTube</a>.</p><p>OpenAI acknowledges the trials here, stating that it will utilize Age Prediction to refine the signals that influence its decision-making and minimize mistakes. If ChatGPT wrongly restricts your account, OpenAI states users can quickly verify their age by submitting a "selfie through Persona, a secure identity-verification service." On a related note, the update highlights what parents can do for teen accounts.</p><h2 id="improving-ai-safety-2">Improving AI safety</h2><p>OpenAI says that parents will find controls to set "quiet hours" in ChatGPT, creating a window of opportunity for their teen to access the AI. Outside of those times, the AI is inaccessible. Additionally, parents can control what the AI "remembers" about their child, alongside tools to control its model training. OpenAI also says parents can opt into notifications if "signs of acute distress" are discovered.</p><p>The post adds that OpenAI will take things slow with its Age Prediction for accuracy purposes. This feature is rolling out in the EU "in the coming weeks" for "regional requirements."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N9SEbiuTEcXvGT9UuzXv7j" name="ChatGPT-for-Android.jpg" alt="ChatGPT for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N9SEbiuTEcXvGT9UuzXv7j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: ChatGPT)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OpenAI had a busy week last week, detailing the arrival of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/openai-says-yes-to-ads-testing-begins-soon-as-cheaper-chatgpt-go-tier-debuts">cheapest ChatGPT Go tier</a>. This subscription is meant to give people all the tools they need in the U.S. after observing a "high adoption rate" in other markets. With ChatGPT Go, users have a much higher usage cap than its free tier. Sending messages, uploading files, images, and more becomes a lot easier.</p><p>The other main highlight from last week's announcement was ads. OpenAI confirmed that ads are headed to ChatGPT's chats; however, it's more of a test. The post said that ads are designed to be "relevant" to your current conversation with the AI. OpenAI claims it won't use the conversations to influence the ads it shows.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While many Chinese smartphone brands are still competing hard in the low-cost market, Honor updated its global strategy and recorded the fastest overseas shipment growth among the world’s top vendors.</p><p>Global research firm Omdia reports that Honor's international shipments rose about 55% year over year in the first three quarters of 2025. This was the best overseas performance among the world’s top 10 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphone brands</a>.</p><p>Five years ago, overseas markets made up less than 10% of Honor’s global sales. By the third quarter of 2025, they were close to half. International business has become a main growth driver, focused on higher price ranges, better channel control, and strategies tailored to each region.</p><p>Rather than focusing only on high sales volume, Honor targeted the $300 to $499 price segment overseas. This range made up about 23% of its international shipments in the first three quarters of 2025, the highest share among major Chinese brands. The trade-off is clear: fewer low-margin sales, but more focus on branding, retail presence, and product differences.</p><p>Honor seems comfortable with that bet. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Magic V5</a>, along with reliable midrange models such as the X9d and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-review">HONOR 400</a>, are designed to support higher average prices while still attracting mainstream customers.</p><h2 id="honor-dominates-by-region-2">Honor dominates by region</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1194px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.01%;"><img id="NnWYD7FM4XcgCH2gWikd7n" name="Omdia-top-Chinese-phone-vendors-2025" alt="Omdia chart showing the top Chinese phone vendors in 2025 led by Honor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NnWYD7FM4XcgCH2gWikd7n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1194" height="621" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor is focusing its efforts by region. Europe is the main area for its premium products. The brand ranked in the top five in important Western European markets like the UK and France. The Magic V5 reached second place in Western Europe’s book-style <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable segment</a>, helped by its slim design, strong battery, and AI features. In Central and Eastern Europe, shipments grew by 15% as Honor expanded its retail channels and brand presence.</p><p>Latin America still accounts for most of Honor’s sales. Mexico and Central America are key markets, but growth is spreading to other areas. Ecuador and parts of the Caribbean saw strong gains, and Brazil had triple-digit growth from a smaller base. Partnerships with operators are very important, and Honor’s experience with telco-led sales gives it an advantage. The upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup is also expected to boost device upgrades and carrier promotions in the region.</p><p>The Middle East and Africa have become the fastest-growing regions for Honor, with shipment volumes almost matching those in Latin America. Premium retail channels, strong partnerships with operators, and in-store demos focused on AI features are helping Honor raise average selling prices in Gulf markets. South Africa also performed well due to products tailored to local needs and operator-led distribution.</p><p>South-Eastern Asia is the next focus for Honor. The company is investing in local manufacturing in Indonesia, and Malaysia acts as a regional brand and service center. Flagship models are becoming more popular, and shipment growth in the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore shows that the brand’s reputation is improving.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Sony is here with a new pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open earbuds</a>, the LinkBuds Clip, which introduce a fresh form factor that doesn't obstruct the wearer's ear canal. The new open earbuds move to the clip or C-shaped design popularized by brands like Motorola and Bose, leaving behind the ring-shaped design of the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sony-linkbuds-review">Sony LinkBuds Open</a>. By comparison, the new Sony LinkBuds Clip address common critiques of the old design, including comfort, sound quality, and noise leakage.</p><p>The company officially announced the LinkBuds Clip today, Jan. 21, and they're now available for $230 in the U.S. This price point positions the LinkBuds Clip as a more affordable option compared to the Moto Buds Loop and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open earbuds</a>, which both retail for $300. After a few days of testing the Sony LinkBuds Clip for myself, it's clear that the price is just one way this pair makes open earbuds more approachable to the masses.</p><p>The first thing that caught my eye about the Sony LinkBuds Clip is the earbuds' charging case. It's smaller than the one you'd get from Bose or Motorola, and much more fun. This charging case has the footprint of a two-inch square with a double-decker design. It's very rounded, looking somewhat like two pillows stacked atop each other.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dnyh4BMBAWTRYFCf4twbB" name="Sony-LinkBuds-Clip-6" alt="The Sony LinkBuds Clip charging case in the Greige colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dnyh4BMBAWTRYFCf4twbB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case is a taller than the competition when laid flat, but it's narrower, and I find this makes the LinkBuds Clip easier to fit in a pocket. These earbuds definitely have character and leave room for customization. The buds themselves are available in black, green, greige, and lavender colors. I tested the greige colorway that you'll see pictured throughout this article.</p><p>You can take the customization a step further by purchasing a case cover for an extra $25, and those are available in coral, green, blue, lavender, and black. The unique aspect of the case covers is that you can pick different colors for the top and bottom portion of the case. They include "fitting cushions" — I'll explain those later — that match the top cover color of the case.</p><p>In theory, that means you could have earbuds in one color, fitting cushions and one half of the case in another, and a third for the bottom case. That's a pretty trendy way to personalize your earbuds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vwdwUHQCh35QKkeEXN5MKo" name="Sony-LinkBuds-Clip-4" alt="The Sony LinkBuds Clip compared to the Moto Buds Loop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vwdwUHQCh35QKkeEXN5MKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Take a look at the LinkBuds Clip compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-moto-loop-buds-review">Moto Buds Loop</a> in the photo above — they're much more compact and simplistic, and to be clear, that's a good thing.</p><p>The Sony LinkBuds Clip work like most other pairs of open earbuds. The large, pill-shaped portion of the earbuds rests behind your ear lobes when in use, with the orb-shaped portion resting above or inside your concha. They way they fit will depend on your ear shape. I found that without the fitting cushions, the audio drivers sat inside my concha, which was a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>Adding the silicone fitting cushions to the upper band of the LinkBuds Clip fixed everything. With this tiny pad adding a bit of space between the LinkBuds Clip and my ear, the audio drivers felt like they were levitating outside my ear canal. That's exactly what you want from a pair of open earbuds. You hear the sound coming from the drivers, but also hear ambient noise in your surrounding to maintain awareness without any pressure.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pCiNGPbJct6TBWaVnBGk7" name="Sony-LinkBuds-Clip-8" alt="These tiny silicone "fitting cushions" make all the difference for comfort." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pCiNGPbJct6TBWaVnBGk7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">These tiny silicone "fitting cushions" make all the difference for comfort. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of sound quality, the Sony LinkBuds Clip are fairly balanced for their category. Open earbuds won't sound as good as traditional earbuds because there is no isolation, and the drivers don't fire directly into your ear canal. Usually, that results in weak bass and a tinny sound. However, the LinkBuds Clip impressed me in that regard, delivering strong bass under the circumstances.</p><p>The earbuds support multipoint connection and the SBC or AAC codecs. There are no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">lossless or high-fidelity codecs</a> here, but they would be redundant anyway due to the sound quality limitations I've mentioned. Instead, what's notable is the three sound modes on the LinkBuds Clip. You'll probably use standard mode most of the time, but there is also a voice boost mode that might be preferable for listening to podcasts or watching videos.</p><p>Most importantly, there is a "sound leakage reduction mode" that changes the sound signature as to not bother others around you. Like any open earbuds, the Sony LinkBuds Clip can be heard by those nearby when they are set to medium-to-high volume levels. The sound leakage reduction mode cuts the mids and the highs, which are easily perceptible by those around, to limit the intrusion. It works well, but the sound quality takes a noticeable hit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c3GZJje6eo3rpJVnaN6jT" name="Sony-LinkBuds-Clip-2" alt="The Sony LinkBuds Clip in the hand in the Greige colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c3GZJje6eo3rpJVnaN6jT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For calls, the LinkBuds Clip use AI for noise reduction and leverage a bone conduction sensor to pick up your voice as you speak.</p><p>The earbuds last up to nine hours on a single charge, and that can extend to 37 hours with the charging case. That should be enough for the longest listening sessions. They <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">have IPX4 liquid-resistance</a>, making them sweatproof for working out.</p><p>I've only listened to the LinkBuds Clip for a few days, and it's too soon to give a final verdict. However, I like what I'm seeing (and hearing) so far. These are minimal open earbuds that keep things simple while undercutting the price of the competition. They're more approachable to newcomers than the older Sony LinkBuds Open, giving the new LinkBuds Clip an advantage.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="71dd99f9-bcac-47a3-83a7-895039c35bc4">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Comfortable-Lightweight-Awareness-Resistant/dp/B0G4SFQGVF/" data-model-name="LinkBuds Clip" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MUj4uwGno7q6wKz8ZFjuD8.jpg' alt="The Sony LinkBuds Clip in a square press render."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Sony</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">LinkBuds Clip</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Stylish open earbuds</strong></em></p><p>The Sony LinkBuds Clip are simple, reliable open earbuds that let you listen to music while being aware of your surroundings.

They get stuffed into crowded backpacks and sometimes have to survive spilled juice boxes. Student devices need to be more than just smart; they need to be tough. Acer understands this, and its latest education Chromebooks focus on both durability and strong internal features.</p><p>Acer has introduced the Chromebook Spin 311 (R725T) and the regular Chromebook 311 (C725), which are the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">education Chromebooks</a> to use the MediaTek Kompanio 540 processor. While we usually see Intel or older ARM chips in this segment, this new silicon promises to handle the heavy lifting of modern STEM apps and Minecraft Education Edition without breaking a sweat.</p><p>The Kompanio 540 chip helps these laptops last longer. Acer says you can get up to 15 hours of battery life on one charge. The chip also makes a fanless design possible, so the laptops stay quiet during study time.</p><p>Acer designed these laptops to meet MIL-STD 810H standards, so they can handle drops from up to 48 inches (122 cm). The keyboard also has a drainage system that can direct up to 11 ounces (330 ml) of liquid away from the inside. So, if a water bottle leaks, the motherboard shouldn't fry instantly.</p><h2 id="easy-modular-repairs-2">Easy, modular repairs</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="pawqPnireDbtfiWjxzPFBj" name="Acer-Chromebook-311-C725" alt="Acer Chromebook 311 C725 from different angles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pawqPnireDbtfiWjxzPFBj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2813" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Acer Chromebook 311 C725 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="cUFwrn4A3HeJ4hfGr6X6Kj" name="Acer-Chromebook-Spin-311-R725T" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 311 R725T from different angles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUFwrn4A3HeJ4hfGr6X6Kj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2813" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Acer Chromebook Spin 311 R725T </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For parents who are tired of replacing devices, repairability is a big advantage. Acer now uses a modular design, so you can swap out the keyboard by removing only two screws. The keys are attached securely to prevent kids from pulling them off, but if one breaks, it is easy to fix. The USB-C ports are also modular, making them simple to replace without changing the whole mainboard.</p><p>These laptops are ready for the future when it comes to connectivity. Both models support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> and Bluetooth 5.3. This may seem unnecessary for now, but as school networks improve, these laptops will keep up and not slow things down.</p><p>Keep in mind that while these laptops are very durable, the screens are still 11.6-inch HD (1366x768) panels. This is typical for this type of device, but you should not expect 4K quality visuals.</p><p>Both models will be available in North America in March 2026. The Chromebook 311 starts at $500, and the Spin 311 starts at $580.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Bixby has continued to exist alongside it, Samsung has never really given it a meaningful upgrade, leaving it feeling more like a basic smart assistant. That appears to be changing with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-official-galaxy-s25-series">One UI 8.5</a>.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introduces-the-new-bixby-in-one-ui-8-5">briefly published an announcement</a> confirming that Bixby will be upgraded into a conversational device agent that uses Perplexity to handle more complex queries. The announcement was quickly taken down, but not before it was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2026/01/20/samsung-makes-bixby-official-in-one-ui-8-5-with-perplexity-ai/">Droid Life</a>.</p><p>In the now-deleted press release, Samsung said that the "new Bixby" will arrive with One UI 8.5. While earlier One UI 8.5 builds had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/incoming-glow-up-samsungs-bixby-huge-one-ui-8-5-upgrade-might-look-like-google">already hinted at these changes</a>, this marks the first time Samsung has officially (albeit accidentally) acknowledged the upgrade.</p><h2 id="what-samsung-accidentally-revealed-about-the-new-bixby-2">What Samsung accidentally revealed about the new Bixby</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ckDHhCiiTLinpzSsMpBv8i" name="bixby-reboot-perplexity-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter" alt="New Bixby in One UI 8.5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckDHhCiiTLinpzSsMpBv8i.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung (now-deleted))</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the announcement, the revamped Bixby will let users control and navigate Galaxy devices using natural language, without needing to issue precise commands. It'll understand user intent and carry out actions accordingly, making interactions feel more natural.</p><p>For example, Samsung notes that users will be able to ask questions like, "Why is my phone screen always on when it is inside my pocket?" and Bixby will use the context and surface relevant settings, such as Accidental Touch Protection, and allow users to enable it.</p><p>Bixby will also tap into real-time web search through Perplexity. This will allow it to pull in up-to-date information and surface results directly within the Bixby interface. For example, Samsung says users will be able to ask something like, "Find me hotels in Seoul that have swimming pools for kids," and Bixby will handle the search and show results instantly.</p><p>Samsung also noted that the upgraded Bixby will be available in "select markets" with One UI 8.5, though it did not specify which ones. The feature is not live yet and is expected to roll out alongside One UI 8.5, which will likely debut with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-accidentally-leaks-s26-design-one-ui-8-5">Galaxy S26 series</a> next month.</p> ]]></dc:content>

All batteries are consumable components that, with enough use and charge cycles, will wear down and need replacing. However, there are steps you can take to prolong the battery health of your smartphone. Minimizing the amount of time your phone spends fully charged is one way to extend the life of your smartphone's battery.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Google Pixel phones</a>, like many others, have software tricks that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tips-pixel-smartphone-battery-health">can make your battery last longer</a>. That includes optimized battery charging. It's a feature that intelligently learns your charging habits and delays filling your phone up to 100% until you're ready to use it. Here's everything you need to know about optimized battery charging on Google Pixel phones — and how to enable it.</p><h2 id="what-is-optimized-charging-on-google-pixel-2">What is optimized charging on Google Pixel?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PRv6WTunoou5USHMbLdwZa" name="google-pixel-10-Pro-XL-pixelsnap-charger-02" alt="Qi2 25W charging using a Pixelsnap charger on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRv6WTunoou5USHMbLdwZa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's optimized battery charging feature for Pixels offers two ways to avoid your phone sitting at maximum capacity for too long. One option is <strong>Adaptive Charging</strong>, which avoids charging your Pixel to full capacity until you're ready to use it. The other is <strong>Limit to 80%</strong>, which imposes a hard cap on your phone's capacity, meaning it will rarely charge your Pixel beyond 80% unless you disable it.</p><p>Adaptive Charging learns your charging habits over a two-week period. For example, if you typically plug in your phone overnight and remove it from the charger at 8 a.m., your Pixel may wait until right before 8 a.m. to finish charging. This avoids your phone remaining at a high state of charge for hours while you sleep, which can be strenuous on the battery.</p><p>This mode displays a notification on your phone's lock screen showing the estimated time your battery will be fully charged. When your charging habits change, like while taking a vacation, Adaptive Charging will know. Your Pixel might not turn on Adaptive Charging in these scenarios, so that your phone is fully charged when you need it.</p><p>The Charge to 80% mode prevents your Pixel from charging past 80% in most situations. It's the best way to prolong the health of your battery, but it also means sacrificing quite a bit of battery life on a daily basis. Your phone will still charge to 100% every 10th cycle for calibration, so that battery capacity remains accurate.</p><p>Adaptive Charging is available on Pixel 4a and later, while Charge to 80% is available on Pixel 6a and later. There is an Adaptive Charging feature for the Pixel 4, but it works differently from the one for newer phones. The Google Pixel 4 version uses an alarm you've set to gauge when you'll wake up rather than learning your charging habits automatically.</p><h2 id="how-to-optimize-charging-on-a-google-pixel-2">How to optimize charging on a Google Pixel</h2><p>Google Pixel phones can turn on optimized battery charging to avoid wearing down their battery too quickly.

As your phone gets older, it will ine<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-does-battery-life-get-worse-over-time" target="_blank">vitably lose capacity and consistency</a>, leading to worse performance and shorter battery life. However, turning on optimized battery charging features isn't always an easy choice to make. Some users worry about voluntarily giving up battery life, which could come back to haunt them if they end up needing it.</p><p>For most users, Adaptive Charging is worth enabling. There's virtually no downside — your Google Pixel will still be charged and ready to go when you wake up, it'll just delay the final charging session while you sleep. There is a small chance that, when you change up your sleeping habits, your phone might not be fully charged when you expect it. With real-time charging notifications, though, your phone will always tell you when it expects to finish charging.</p><p>The hard 80% charging limit is a tougher sell. This is because you're essentially giving up 20% of your battery capacity now for the possibility of prolonged battery health in the future. It's a good option for people who never drain their battery fully. For everyone else, it's best to stick with Adaptive Charging.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ab440fa2-7aad-46ef-aed4-7847a75d6216">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMhL9mghoD6NWUtd7mbtEY.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 in Lemongrass"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Google</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>All about battery health</strong></em></p><p>For better or worse, the Google Pixel 10 takes major steps to protect your battery health.

Infinix is challenging that idea with its latest release, the Note Edge. The phone aims to offer both a large battery and a slim design, so you don’t have to compromise.</p><p>The Infinix Note Edge has a slim 7.2mm body, a 3D-curved AMOLED display, ultra-narrow bezels, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/future-budget-android-phones-will-have-tougher-screens-thanks-to-cornings-new-glass">Corning Gorilla Glass 7i</a> for protection. The screen measures 6.78 inches, offers 1.5K resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, 10-bit color, and can reach up to 4,500 nits of brightness for HDR content.</p><p>What’s interesting is how Infinix managed to fit a large 6,500mAh battery into a slim phone. Usually, batteries this big make phones bulky. Infinix says it used advanced high-density materials and a "self-repairing" technology that fixes small battery cell damage during low-current charging.</p><p>Check your region before buying, though, as some markets may get a slightly smaller 6,150mAh battery. This battery supports 45W fast charging, can reach 50% in under 30 minutes, and uses adaptive bypass charging to manage heat during gaming or navigation.</p><h2 id="longevity-is-a-selling-point-not-an-afterthought-2">Longevity is a selling point, not an afterthought</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.67%;"><img id="99XWJL5jR9x3Barob8PefJ" name="Infinix-Note-Edge-screen" alt="Infinix Note Edge screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99XWJL5jR9x3Barob8PefJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Infinix’s lab data says the battery should keep over 80% of its capacity after 2,000 charge cycles. That means it could last about six years of daily use if these claims hold up in real-world conditions.</p><p>Inside, the Note Edge is the first phone to use the MediaTek Dimensity 7100 5G chipset. Built on a 6nm process, it combines Cortex-A78 and A55 cores with a Mali-G610 MC2 GPU. This setup should offer smoother multitasking, stable frame rates up to 90fps in supported games, and better power efficiency than older midrange chips.</p><p>Software is another area where the Note Edge tries to punch above its weight. XOS 16, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, introduces a new Glow Space design language with dynamic lighting effects, physics-based haptic feedback, and playful 3D depth wallpapers.</p><p>Infinix promises three years of OS updates and five years of security patches, which is the longest update commitment for the Note series so far.</p><p>The starting price is about $200, which is very competitive. As phone prices keep rising, the Infinix Note Edge stands out as a strong value. You can reserve it now, and open sales are expected soon in select global markets.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A new leak has now revealed the color options for the top-of-the-line <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-accidentally-leaks-s26-design-one-ui-8-5">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>, and no, it is not getting the iPhone 17 Pro's orange shade.</p><p>Reliable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/2013697060181102742">Evan Blass shared on X</a> that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will be available in a total of six colors: black, white, silver shadow, sky blue, cobalt violet, and pink gold.</p><p>If these sound familiar, that is because they mostly are. Samsung already offers black, white, silver, and blue shades on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, so there are no major surprises there. The two new additions this time appear to be cobalt violet and pink gold, which might be Samsung's online-exclusive colors.</p><h2 id="no-bold-color-choices-this-year-from-samsung-2">No bold color choices this year from Samsung</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NQc2b9Nw99vVV8dMygn5Nc" name="s26-ultra-leaked-colors" alt="Leaked Galaxy S26 Ultra SIM card trays" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQc2b9Nw99vVV8dMygn5Nc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @UniverseIce on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Adding to this, another leaker, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2012844892368797879">@UniverseIce on X</a>, shared images of SIM card trays in these colors, giving us an early look at how the finishes might appear. The blue, silver, and black options look fairly tame, while the purple shade stands out as the most interesting of the bunch.</p><p>The presence of a SIM tray also suggests that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will ship with a physical SIM card, unlike the Pixel 10 series and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-17-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25">iPhone 17 lineup</a>. That said, there is still a chance Samsung could offer eSIM-only models in some regions like the U.S., though there are no concrete rumors around that yet.</p><p>Samsung has traditionally played it safe with flagship colors, and the Galaxy S26 Ultra seems to be following the same approach. While it would have been nice to see something more adventurous, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro's Cosmic Orange</a>, Samsung appears to be sticking to familiar territory once again.</p><p>That said, the cobalt violet shade does look intriguing, and it'll be interesting to see how it looks in real life.</p><p>As for the launch, the Galaxy S26 series now seems just weeks away. Leaks point to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-confirms-galaxy-s26-series-naming-scheme">February 25, 2026, debut</a>, with the phones expected to go on sale in early March.

Tipster AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-page-match-3633793/">Android Authority</a>) brought this to the surface, claiming that this supposed feature aims to sync your physical book with its audiobook version. Currently dubbed "Page Match" in the early code, AssembleDebug unearthed code that states users can "jump between the book (or EBook) and the audiobook."</p><p>It seems like Spotify is trying to elevate this feature by bringing the user's involvement into greater play.</p><p>According to the post, a code description reads, "scan a page to match your progress." If you've already started the audiobook and have recently picked up its physical edition, users can use their phones to scan the real-life version's page. Essentially, if you want to start on pg. 45, you'd scan that page, and Spotify's "Page Match" will (literally) match the audiobook to that, so you can continue.</p><p>However, the tipster reports an additional feature. Another line of code states users can utilize Page Match in reverse. Instead of first scanning the physical page to sync Page Match's audiobook feature to you, users can have Page Match tell them what page they're on, so they can get there in the physical version.</p><h2 id="get-some-reading-in-today-2">Get some reading in today</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CfNXmNKkCC8CdfEWrjzDfB" name="Spotify" alt="Spotify Premium Platinum plan details in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfNXmNKkCC8CdfEWrjzDfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's still more work to be done, as there's no clear-cut answer as to when we might see this. What is clear is that Spotify is looking to bridge its audiobooks with physical and e-books for users. Moreover, this will likely be a Premium feature; be aware of that. The tipster also speculates that Page Match will be "limited" to markets that have audiobooks available on Spotify currently.</p><p>If you remember, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify-premium-challenges-audible-monthly-audiobooks">Spotify let its audiobooks section fly</a> a few years back when it launched 200,000 "free" titles. There was a caveat here: Premium subscribers could listen to audiobooks for 15 hours per month before the platform would ask for an additional $12.99 (for an extra 10 hours) to keep going beyond that.</p><p>As far as recent happenings go, Spotify introduced a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotifys-dms-bring-the-friendship-with-jam-session-requests-listening-activities">Request to Jam</a>" feature in its platform's DMs. Now, if you see one of your friends listening to some swanky tunes, you can ask to join in, offering your selection of music, as well. On a different note, the service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-is-basically-telling-subscribers-to-switch-with-latest-price-hike">also raised its prices</a>. U.S. subscribers were met with a $1 increase for its Individual and Student plans ($12.99 and 6.99). Elsewhere, Spotify Premium Duo and Family plans went up by $2.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These tablets aren't meant for users who want a high-powered device for all-day gaming or video editing, but for those who need a big screen to watch YouTube, answer emails, and get some light work done without it feeling slow or cheap.</p><p>Samsung has now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-a17-5g-and-tab-a11-plus-show-how-far-samsungs-budget-lineup-has-come">introduced the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus</a> in the U.S. as an upgrade to the nearly two-year-old Galaxy Tab A9 Plus. While the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus may not appear to be a major generational leap on the surface, Samsung has introduced several meaningful under-the-hood upgrades that make the 2025 model the superior option.</p><p>If you're deciding whether to pick up the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus at a discounted price or want to understand what the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus improves over its predecessor, here is how Samsung's budget tablets compare.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-a11-plus-vs-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab A11 Plus vs. Galaxy Tab A9 Plus: Pricing and availability</h2><p>Samsung introduced the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus in international markets on September 30, 2025, but it was not until December 30, 2025, that the company announced its U.S. launch. Post the announcement, the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus officially went on sale in the U.S. starting January 8, 2026.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, on the other hand, was unveiled in October 2023 and became available in the U.S. on January 12, 2024. Since it has been on the market for some time, the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/nice-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-is-still-32-percent-off-weeks-after-christmas">can now be found at discounted prices</a> as low as $160, which is approximately $60 less than its original launch price of $220.</p><p>In terms of pricing, Samsung has increased the base price of the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus compared to the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus. The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus launched at $220 with 64GB of storage, while the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus starts at $250 in the U.S. with 128GB of storage (although it offers more RAM as well).</p><p>Like the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus is available in Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi + cellular versions. The Wi-Fi-only model comes in 128 GB and 256 GB options and goes up to $310, while the 5G variant starts at $280 and is available only with 128 GB of storage.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-a11-plus-vs-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-design-and-build-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab A11 Plus vs. Galaxy Tab A9 Plus: Design and build</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Gbuxk86spcNzyTv9QybaBW" name="tab-a11-plus-1" alt="Different colors of the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gbuxk86spcNzyTv9QybaBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus and Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, you'll notice a lot of similarities between the two devices, partly because Samsung hasn't changed the design much from the 2024 model. Both tablets feature a unibody metal design with a simple, minimal back and a single rear camera.</p><p>Both models also share the same dimensions at 257.1 × 168.7 × 6.9mm. At 6.9mm, the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus is thin and easy to carry. While there aren't any major design changes compared to the Tab A9 Plus, there are three small but noticeable updates on the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus.</p><p>The first is the weight. The Galaxy Tab A11 Plus weighs 477g, which is about 3g lighter than the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus at 480g. This isn't a huge difference, but it's worth noting.</p><p>The second and more meaningful change is the IP rating. While Samsung didn't make major design changes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-welcomes-galaxy-a17-5g-galaxy-tab-a11-galaxy-ecosystem/">it says</a> the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus now comes with IP52 water and dust resistance, which is an upgrade over the Tab A9 Plus that had no IP rating.</p><p>IP52 doesn't mean you can use it in the rain or take it swimming, but it does offer protection against splashes, making it safer to use in places like the kitchen or around kids.</p><p>The last design change is the color options. The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus came in Graphite, Silver, and Navy (blue). This time, Samsung has dropped the Navy option, replaced Graphite with a darker gray, and kept Silver.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AZCp9s5ihThj4NsWhLzuzF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-tab-a9-plus-lifestyle.jpg" alt="A hand on the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZCp9s5ihThj4NsWhLzuzF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the front, both tablets use the same display.

While Samsung devices often offer better displays than rivals at this price, neither the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus nor the Tab A9 Plus stands out here, though the screens are still fine for everyday use.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-a11-plus-vs-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab A11 Plus vs. Galaxy Tab A9 Plus: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1259px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cx9ideyY3cj9BpqL6xT68Q" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-A11-Plus-display" alt="The Galaxy Tab A11 Plus display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cx9ideyY3cj9BpqL6xT68Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1259" height="708" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's Galaxy Tab A series doesn't compete with the company's flagship Galaxy Tab S lineup, so you should expect more budget-level specs here. That said, Samsung has made several meaningful upgrades to both the hardware and software that you don't usually see on budget Android tablets.</p><p>Inside the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus, you'll find MediaTek's MT8775 chipset. While it's not part of the more familiar Dimensity lineup, it's an octa-core chip with clock speeds up to 2.5 GHz. This should deliver a noticeable performance boost over the Snapdragon 695 used in the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus</p><p>Along with the faster chipset, Samsung has also increased storage and RAM across the lineup. The Galaxy Tab A11 Plus now starts with 128 GB of storage and 6 GB of RAM and goes up to 256 GB of storage with 8 GB of RAM, while the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus offered just 4 GB of RAM in its base model. Like its predecessor, the A11 Plus also supports microSD cards for storage expansion up to 2 TB.</p><p>Like the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus is also available in a 5G cellular version, though it costs more than the Wi-Fi-only model.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Tab A11 Plus</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 (Android 16)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>11-inch, TFT LCD, 480 nits peak brightness, 90Hz, 1920 x 1200 pixels</p></td><td  ><p>11-inch, TFT LCD, 480 nits peak brightness, 90Hz, 1920 x 1200 pixels</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Stylus support</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek MT8775</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 695</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>6GB / 8GB</p></td><td  ><p>4GB / 8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB / 256GB</p><p>Expandable up to 2TB via microSD card</p></td><td  ><p>128GB / 256GB</p><p>Expandable up to 2TB via microSD card</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>8MP, AF</p></td><td  ><p>8MP, AF</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>5MP</p></td><td  ><p>5MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP52</p></td><td  ><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.3, 3.5mm headphone jack</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1, 3.5mm headphone jack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,040 mAh</p></td><td  ><p>7,040 mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W USB-C fast wired charging</p></td><td  ><p>15W USB-C fast wired charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>257.1 X 168.7 X 6.9 mm</p><p>Weight: 477g</p></td><td  ><p>257.1 x 168.7 x 6.9 mm</p><p>Weight: 480g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Gray, Silver</p></td><td  ><p>Graphite, Silver, Navy</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>When it comes to battery, Samsung has kept the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus at the same capacity as the previous generation since it uses the same body and dimensions as the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus. That means both tablets pack a 7,040 mAh battery, which isn't the largest you'll find in an 11-inch tablet.</p><p>Thankfully, Samsung has increased charging speeds from 15W to 25W, so the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus will take much less time to fully charge compared to the older model.</p><p>The biggest upgrade, however, is in the software. The Galaxy Tab A11 Plus runs One UI 8 based on Android 16 out of the box, putting it ahead of the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, which launched with Android 15-based One UI 7.</p><p>On top of that, Samsung is offering up to seven years of OS updates, which is unusual in this price segment. No other budget Android tablet offers this level of long-term software support. You also get some Google AI features out of the box on the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus, including access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Google Gemini</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">Circle to Search</a>, and more.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-a11-plus-vs-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab A11 Plus vs. Galaxy Tab A9 Plus: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FL54fNkYL2YaJSgbRopv25" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-lifestyle" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus in all colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FL54fNkYL2YaJSgbRopv25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to cameras, you shouldn't expect much from an Android tablet since most people aren't using one to shoot concerts or take photos outdoors.

They're offered to make it simple to start actions like opening the camera, viewing the screen, silencing the device, or even accessing your digital assistant, all without having to click a button or even speak a command.</p><p>There are two main types of gesture controls for Pixel phones. The most basic is Navigation gestures, which, as the name implies, use gestures rather than button sequences to navigate menus and screens. The second is quick-access Gestures, which let you perform a specific motion to achieve a predetermined result. You can enable or disable the first and enable, disable, and customize the second.</p><h2 id="how-to-enable-or-disable-navigation-gestures-2">How to enable or disable Navigation gestures</h2><p>Navigation gestures allow you to do things like swipe up from the bottom of the screen to go back to the Home screen or swipe up and hold to switch apps. You can also swipe from the left or right of the screen to return to the previous page.</p><p>If you prefer not to use these gestures, the alternative is three-button navigation. With this, you'll see buttons at the bottom of the screen for go back, Home, and switch apps.

Most other phone manufacturers have similar features and gesture controls, too. It's a pity you can't activate both Gesture navigation and three-button navigation at the same time. But most people will prefer Gesture.</p><p>For other gestures, I like quick tap for taking screenshots, something I do often. Double-pressing to open the camera is handy, but if you use your digital wallet a lot, you might find value in switching to that. I love the Flip to Shhh feature as well, perfect if you're in a meeting or presentation and forgot to silence your phone. You can subtly flip the phone over as you talk without anyone being any the wiser that you just silenced it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="40395e50-8b5d-4b3c-9363-c16e7284d5f8">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v7tTq5vDNGq3xgc6J7Wz3i.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Responds to your movements</strong></em></p><p>Use Gesture controls on all the latest and even older model Google Pixel phones, including the new foldable Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

Just like the very popular Galaxy A16 5G that came before it, this model too is set to receive six generations of Android OS upgrades. The fact that it ships with Android 16 means you have many years' worth of use, even if your budget is lower than $200.</p><p>With the Galaxy A16 5G being barely a year old and still sold online, buyers now have to decide between the Samsung Galaxy A17 vs. Galaxy A16. It's actually not a very tough choice, and you'll soon see why, but there are a few important differences between the two that you ought to know about before swiping your card.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a17-vs-galaxy-a16-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy A17 vs. Galaxy A16: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2806px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.33%;"><img id="ADNYcTuGZqN3mGQz6dw5sd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A16-5G-Features" alt="A graphic showing Galaxy A16 5G features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ADNYcTuGZqN3mGQz6dw5sd.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2806" height="1272" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy A17 5G looks practically the same as the Galaxy A16 from the front. You still have thick bezels, an ugly chin, and that old-style waterdrop notch for the front camera. The rear camera island is now gone in favor of a clustered setup. In a way, it looks a bit different and nicer (?) perhaps. What's objectively better is the thickness and weight, both of which have gone down. This means the Galaxy A17 is just a tad bit lighter and slimmer when you take it with you.</p><p>There doesn't seem to be any changes made to the display of the Galaxy A17. Just like the Galaxy A16 5G, this too features a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate, 800 nits of peak brightness, and Full HD+ resolution. You might have some trouble viewing content on the screen under direct sunlight, but other than that, it should be decent in other scenarios.</p><p>The Galaxy A17 5G comes in two shades, Blue and Black. The phone also gets an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance, and there's Corning Gorilla Glass Victus over the display for scratch protection.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a17-vs-galaxy-a16-hardware-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy A17 vs. Galaxy A16: Hardware & specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GTmBZSGNaGNdzMXZdUoZbA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A16-Gaming-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy A16 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GTmBZSGNaGNdzMXZdUoZbA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The core specs of the Samsung Galaxy A17 5G are very similar to the Galaxy A16 5G. Both phones are powered by the Exynos 1330 chip and come with 128GB of storage. Samsung is bringing just one variant to the U.S., and this has just 4GB of RAM. This is not a great spec to have, especially on a phone running regular Android and not the stripped-down Go Edition.</p><p>While we haven't tested the Galaxy A17, user comments on Samsung's Galaxy A16 U.S. store page show buyers being unhappy with the slow and laggy performance. The A16 also came with 4GB of RAM (6GB at best), so we suspect a similar situation with the A17 as well.</p><p>Samsung has priced the Galaxy A17 at the same $199 as the A16, but it has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-newest-samsung-galaxy-phone-is-already-getting-some-major-discounts-across-the-web" target="_blank">gone on sale</a> and is retailing for $170. If you don't have a hard budget cap, I'd recommend spending a bit more (roughly $200) to get the global variant, which comes with 8GB RAM. Just be sure to cross-check the supported 5G bands with your carrier.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy A17</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy A16</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (One UI), up to 6 OS upgrades</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (One UI), up to 6 OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Black, Blue</p></td><td  ><p>Black</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.7 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.7 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,340 x 1,080</p></td><td  ><p>2,340 x 1,080</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+, Super AMOLED</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+, Super AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>90Hz</p></td><td  ><p>90Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos 1330</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos 1330</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>4GB</p></td><td  ><p>4GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (expandable up to 1TB)</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (expandable up to 1TB)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main (OIS), <br>5MP ultra-wide,<br>2MP macro, <br>13MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, <br>5MP ultra-wide,<br>2MP macro, <br>13MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP54</p></td><td  ><p>IP54</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>164.4 x 77.9 x 7.5 mm</p></td><td  ><p>164.4 x 77.9 x 7.9 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>192 grams</p></td><td  ><p>200 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>There have been no changes made to the battery capacity on the Galaxy A17 5G. It has the same 5,000mah size as the Galaxy A16 5G. Given the AMOLED display and entry-level SoC, I think you should easily be able to get two full days on a single charge. Charging speed is a decent 25W for a budget phone, but remember you'll need to buy the charger separately.</p><p>The Galaxy A17 supports 5G and you can either buy it unlocked or via the three big carriers in the U.S.. The phone supports expandable storage, but you'll need to give up one of the SIM slots for it. There are no headphone jacks on either the A17 or A16, so you'll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-headphone-jack">shop from this list</a> if you need this feature.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a17-vs-galaxy-a16-software-2">Samsung Galaxy A17 vs. Galaxy A16: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7zLNQRGNrfYL2XTYJzWinn" name="samsung-galaxy-a17-render-OS-upgrade" alt="Samsung Galaxy A17 render showing 6 OS upgrades" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7zLNQRGNrfYL2XTYJzWinn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy A16 5G was the one that set the bar for six OS upgrades on a budget phone, and the Galaxy A17 5G continues the trend. Samsung is confident it can deliver six years of security patches for a phone costing less than $200, and that's a highly commendable feat.</p><p>The Galaxy A16 5G shipped with Android 14, which means it's already had two out of the six OS upgrades. This gives the Galaxy A17 an advantage since it ships with Android 16, so there's still a long way to go before it stops getting OS updates. A few basic AI features are present too, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and potentially more as newer versions of One UI roll out.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a17-vs-galaxy-a16-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy A17 vs. Galaxy A16: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1082px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.45%;"><img id="EDwbdG4M3UatyGAu9Ny46Z" name="samsung-galaxy-a16-5g-colors-camera-example.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy A16 in multiple colors such as dark blue, light green, and light gray." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EDwbdG4M3UatyGAu9Ny46Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1082" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung hasn't fiddled with the cameras on the Galaxy A17 5G too much over the A16, except for one crucial addition. The main 50MP camera on the A17 is now optically stabilized, which means low-light shots should be sharper and have less blurring. Everything else has stayed exactly the same. The ultrawide camera is only 5MP, so quality is going to be pretty weak. There's a third 2MP camera as well, but I wouldn't expect much from this.</p><p>The front camera gets a 13MP sensor on both phones, with video recording topping out at 1080p. It's the same story with the rear cameras too, for video recording, which shows the limitation of the chipset.</p><p>For a $199 phone, though, it's hard to expect much more. If you're buying this, it's definitely not for the photography experience, so I don't think many would complain.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a17-vs-galaxy-a16-which-one-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy A17 vs. Galaxy A16: Which one should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iL6QJTthBg9pytB6vLEemJ" name="samsung-galaxy-a17-render-AI" alt="Samsung Galaxy A17 5G render with Circle to Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iL6QJTthBg9pytB6vLEemJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy A17 5G feels like the better bargain than the A16 thanks to better camera tech, Android 16, and the lighter design. I'd still be wary about getting the model officially sold by Samsung in the U.S. since 4GB of RAM is simply too low for a good Android experience. If you can pop over to a Best Buy or Samsung store near you and get a feel of the phone in person, that would be ideal.</p><p>The Galaxy A16 5G is still a good bargain, as it's virtually identical to the A17, and it's now cheaper and still has many OS upgrades left under its belt. Once again, if you can get a higher RAM variant of the phone, get that instead of the 4GB one. If you plan on keeping this phone for many years, that extra helping of RAM will certainly help keep future Android generations running smoothly.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="660c53b5-2c6f-4276-a78a-c730785b0d6f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j69fQSiBG9SnyaXGL9vw8F.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy A17 render in blue"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Samsung</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Galaxy A17 5G</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Same as the A16, but slightly improved</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A17 5G is only marginally better than the A16, and the U.S. variant only gets 4GB of RAM.

Samsung is offering just one variant in the U.S. with 4GB of RAM. This is generally what you can expect in this segment, but know that performance might not be very smooth.

We've actually used this phone and found the Android experience to be smooth, despite all odds. One reason could be that Moto UX is leaner than Samsung's One UI skin.</p><p>Samsung has priced the Galaxy A17 at the same $199 as the Moto G 2026, but it has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-newest-samsung-galaxy-phone-is-already-getting-some-major-discounts-across-the-web" target="_blank">gone on sale</a> and is retailing for $170.

The A17 launched in other countries much earlier in 2025 and has come to the U.S. only now. While it initially shipped with One UI 7 (Android 15), it has begun getting the One UI 8 (Android 16) update already in some countries. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-one-ui-8-5-could-offer-the-most-impactful-performance-update">Upcoming versions of One UI</a> hint at being even smoother and faster, which bodes well for a budget phone like the A17 5G.</p><p>Motorola doesn't have the best track record for timely software updates and this reflects in its OS upgrade commitment too. The Moto G 2026 ships with Android 16 but it will be getting just two generations of Android OS upgrades. This means Android 18 would be the last major release that would come to this phone. While that still gives you few years worth of use, it's no where as competitive as Samsung.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a17-vs-moto-g-2026-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy A17 vs. Moto G 2026: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BLabHVFeeDHfT4JfH7mgQJ" name="moto-g-2026-camera-island" alt="The pink Moto G 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLabHVFeeDHfT4JfH7mgQJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung easily takes the win here as it offers an optically stabilized (OIS) main camera and an ultrawide camera. The 50MP main sensor should be able to capture decent images and video, especially in low light. The ultrawide is only 5MP, but at least the option is there when you need it. The 2MP macro seems a bit pointless on both phones, to be honest, but it's around.</p><p>The Moto G 2026 has a 50MP main camera too, but without OIS. It also lacks an ultrawide camera, which I feel is a big miss. It does sort of make up for this with a much higher resolution 32MP selfie camera, compared to the 16MP sensor in the Galaxy.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a17-vs-moto-g-2026-which-one-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy A17 vs. Moto G 2026: Which one should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="pYHEuGAPNC8biKw2XvRnKX" name="Galaxy-A17-5G" alt="Galaxy A17 5G in black, blue and gray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pYHEuGAPNC8biKw2XvRnKX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If I had to pick the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">best phone at $200</a>, I'd buy the Samsung Galaxy A17 5G over the Moto G 2026. The fact that Samsung has already discounted it soon after launch is a sign that it's serious about grabbing a piece of Motorola's market share. The specs of the A17 5G are also mostly better than the Moto, as it gets an IP rating, much better display tech, a slimmer design, better cameras, and way longer software support.</p><p>The only real question mark is whether the software can run well on just 4GB of RAM. If you're buying unlocked and don't mind an international model, you can find the 8GB variant of the A17 on Amazon for a little more than $200.</p><p>The Moto G 2026 is a solid phone and will make a whole lot of sense once it's discounted to below $150. At its current price, though, Samsung has a more feature-rich option that you really shouldn't ignore.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="660c53b5-2c6f-4276-a78a-c730785b0d6f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j69fQSiBG9SnyaXGL9vw8F.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy A17 render in blue"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Samsung</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Galaxy A17 5G</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The better package</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A17 5G has better specs and features than the Moto G 2026, making it the one to buy.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="18bfd74a-c45b-455e-bf54-3bd1039b9511">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sPXM9HD4PU6Vt7yMq4UpxU.jpg' alt="Moto G 2026 render front and back"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Motorola</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Moto G 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Not good enough</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G 2026 is a good budget phone but it pales in comparison with the Galaxy A17 5G.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold stand alone as the best options available, with the OnePlus Open briefly offering another option before fading away without future revisions. Soon, the market will get a true third contender. This time, it's from Motorola.</p><p>Motorola spent a few years reinventing itself, specifically in the clamshell foldable space. It's trying to be a hip and fashionable brand, using partnerships with PANTONE and Swarovski to offer unique products. One thing we haven't seen yet is a large Motorola Razr device, but we got our first look at one — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">Motorola Razr Fold</a> — at CES 2025. Motorola's upcoming Razr Fold is its first stab at a big-screen foldable, and it's already impressing us in a few ways.</p><p>The Razr Fold will face tough competition from the beginning, namely from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (or the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Z Fold 8</a>, whenever it releases). Here's how we expect the two folding phones to compare.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-design-and-displays-2">Motorola Razr Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Design and displays</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sRL3v2oHNAkdtnNHm4mPyH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sRL3v2oHNAkdtnNHm4mPyH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola revealed the design and display of the Razr Fold at CES 2025, and it's an attractive smartphone. When folded, the Motorola Razr Fold looks like a typical Motorola phone on the back. It has a two-tone look with a squircle-shaped platform for the cameras, housing three rear camera sensors and a flash. There's also a Motorola logo on the back-center of the phone and the "razr" branding near the bottom.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Fold appears to have polished aluminum rails that accent the back panel. Instead of a typical frosted glass back color, Motorola is using unique materials on the Razr Fold in collaboration with PANTONE. There appear to be vegan leather back covers for the PANTONE Blackened Blue and PANTONE Lily White colorways. The phone's corners are subtly rounded, but resemble the boxy Galaxy Z Fold 7 more than the curvy Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>We can gauge the general form factor of the Motorola Razr Fold from its screen sizes — there's a 6.6-inch cover screen and an 8.1-inch main screen. However, Motorola hasn't shared the exact dimensions for the device. We don't know if it'll be as thin as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which set a new standard for foldable thinness this year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4527" height="2546" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 measures just 8.9mm thick when folded. That's only fractions of a millimeter more than the 8.2mm thickness of the non-folding Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. The more impressive spec might be that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 only weighs 215 grams. It does this while offering a premium hinge mechanism and meeting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-waterproof">IP48 rating for durability</a>.</p><p>The main display on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is an 8.0-inch foldable Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X panel with a 2184 x 1968 resolution and support for 120Hz refresh rates. Notably, Samsung dropped S Pen support from the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with this generation in an effort to make the display assembly smaller. The Motorola Razr Fold has the potential to offer better displays, with a slightly larger 8.1-inch panel and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-things-hits-the-new-year-with-an-ultra-stylus-for-the-razr-fold-at-ces-2026">stylus support</a>, but that could come in exchange for a thicker chassis.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z2xCD7fbmdb2bTg4qm2tyH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z2xCD7fbmdb2bTg4qm2tyH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As of now, we know the main Razr Fold display panel will use LTPO technology for variable refresh rates, and that it'll have a 2K resolution.

The crease on the Galaxy Z Fold 7's folding display might be more subtle than the one on the Motorola Razr Fold. The overall hardware experience, from the processor to the build quality, might be to Samsung's advantage.</p><p>It's hard to tell for sure, though, because the underlying Motorola Razr Fold specs are unconfirmed. We expect the phone to support the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> chip with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage, but we don't know that for sure. It's unclear how Motorola would clock a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip on the Razr Fold, even if it gets one.

Samsung put the same 200MP main camera sensor from the Galaxy S25 Ultra on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is a nice touch. It's sharper than the 50MP Sony LYTIA sensor that will headline the rear camera system on the Motorola Razr Fold.</p><p>However, the rest of the camera system favors Motorola. The Razr Fold has a 50MP ultrawide and 50MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom support for its secondary cameras. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 7's secondary cameras are less impressive, offering just a 10MP ultrawide and 10MP telephoto.</p><p>Motorola will win the selfie camera battle, too, with a 20MP internal selfie camera and a 32MP external selfie camera. Samsung uses two 10MP selfie cameras on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. It's worth noting that, with a foldable phone, you can use the rear cameras as a selfie camera for the best quality. This makes traditional selfie cameras less important.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-which-should-you-buy-2">Motorola Razr Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5sTw2NJoKE3mV2jLSMJUiH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5sTw2NJoKE3mV2jLSMJUiH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola is tight-lipped about many key specifications of the Razr Fold. We don't know what chip it will use, how long its battery will last, or even how much it will cost. However, the company gave us just enough information to keep us intrigued. It's set to introduce the largest inner screen of any foldable phone available in the U.S., and it's adding stylus support at a time when other brands are removing it.</p><p>That said, it's hard to ignore that Motorola faces an uphill battle with its entry into the large foldable market. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is really good, and it'll be hard for Motorola to match its thinness, premium feel, and durability in its first try. Adding to the difficulty is the timing of Motorola's Razr Fold launch — it could arrive right before, or around the time of, Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 8 launch.</p><p>It's entirely possible that Motorola's first try at a large foldable could mimic Google's entry into the space. The Google Pixel Fold was unimpressive in comparison to other foldables available at the time, but it quickly caught up to speed with the next Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In other words, we need to keep expectations reasonable for the Motorola Razr Fold. It's a first-generation product, after all.</p><p>For those who want a great foldable Android phone today, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the clear winner.

Make no mistake, this is a (handheld) mobile gaming-focused phone that RedMagic states it has pushed to the limit with "elite" capabilities and a cooling system.</p><p>In a press release, the company confirms the RedMagic 11 Air features a 6.8-inch, 1.5K display with a 144Hz refresh rate. RedMagic claims to have elevated its phone with an extremely narrow 1.25mm bezel and a 95.1% screen-to-body ratio. In short, your viewing experience is "immersive," according to RedMagic, with minimal borders.</p><p>The 11 Air's gaming prowess advances, as the post states its touch sampling reaches 250Hz, while its multi-finger tracking reaches 960Hz. This essentially ensures (or at least tries to) that every touch on the screen is recognized and put into action.</p><p>Internally, consumers can expect quick LPDDR5X ULTRA RAM and UFS 4.1 storage. RedMagic says that, in tandem, its included RAM and storage help with multitasking, heavy toll responsiveness, and smooth gameplay. There's support for 2K 144Hz rendering for roughly 200 mobile games available right now. However, there's a little hardware gift: shoulder triggers. RedMagic says these triggers feature a 520Hz response rate, delivering "precision" for MOBAs, FPS, and ARPG titles.</p><p>You'd also benefit from knowing that the RedMagic 11 Air rocks a 7,000mAh battery with 120W wired charging to keep you in the game and get you back in a hurry.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:10000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VbhjShDshSN2fwyVmaJ4GF" name="redmagic-11-air-white" alt="The RedMagic 11 Air in white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbhjShDshSN2fwyVmaJ4GF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="10000" height="5625" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RedMagic)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest gaming phone features the REDMAGIC Energy Cube 3.0 engine with "millisecond-level intelligent scheduling." It's stated that this engine works to optimize "the coordination of performance, graphics, frame rate, and power consumption for maximum efficiency."</p><p>The phone's cooling system is another aspect that's turning heads. The company highlights that this is the first Air-series model to feature the Turbo Fan 4.0. This fan can reach heights of 24,000 RPM, and its redesigned fan blades facilitate a much cooler air flow by 21% with a 40% sweep area. This fan for the device is pretty quiet, meaning users can cool down their phone even better and stay hushed while doing so.</p><p>The RedMagic 11 Air isn't all about gaming—you can take photos, too. The phone sports a dual camera system, featuring a 50MP OIS (optical image stabilization) and an 8MP ultrawide lens. The company's REDMAGIC OS 11 leans on its AI software for the 11 Air to create a more useful device from the ground up. Users will have access to AI Object Recognition, AI Screen Search, and Tactical Coach for real-time strategic guidance while playing.</p><h2 id="gaming-s-great-but-what-about-price-2">Gaming's great, but what about price?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:10000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGsfBGCfjbbEPnmsPCNEdE" name="redmagic-11-air-white-black" alt="The RedMagic 11 Air in white and black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGsfBGCfjbbEPnmsPCNEdE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="10000" height="5625" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RedMagic)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As previously stated, the RedMagic 11 Air launched in China earlier today (Jan 20). With that, the phone starts at 3,699 RMB, which is roughly $530. This is broken down by RAM/storage configs, meaning the 12/256GB variant is at this 3,699 RMB (~$530) price. RedMagic kicks things up a little for its 16/512GB for 4,399 RMB (~$630). This device is available in white and black.</p><p>It's worth noting that these prices might change should the RedMagic 11 Air see a global launch and arrive in the U.S. They're just guestimates for now. Speaking of a global release, RedMagic says it plans to formally announce when others may see the phone on January 29.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OnePlus may not have a sizable market share, but when it comes to mind share, there isn't another Android phone manufacturer that gets quite as much attention. A lot of that has to do with the brand's beginnings and its focus on enthusiasts, and although that OnePlus no longer exists, its echoes remain even under the stewardship of OPPO.</p><p>A new report indicated the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-oneplus-collapse">brand is being dismantled</a>, but that isn't quite the case. If anything, OnePlus is entering a new era under OPPO, one where it is laser-focused on its portfolio and positioning. Instead of launching several products across tiers, the manufacturer will now focus its attention on a few crucial devices — that's one of the reasons we haven't seen a Nord launch in the U.S. in over two and a half years, even though the budget phones outsell the flagships by a factor of ten.</p><p>That's also why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">15R</a> didn't stand out quite as much as their Chinese rivals, with the cameras in particular being a downgrade from the previous generation. OnePlus still has a foothold in North America — it is still the only Chinese manufacturer other than Motorola to do so — and the brand will likely continue to release its flagship and mid-range R devices in the region.</p><p>Outside of that, though, there won't be much in the way of launches. And when it comes to other countries, OnePlus India CEO Robin Liu confirmed that there isn't any change in how OnePlus is conducting its business in the region:</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wanted to address some misinformation that has been circulating about OnePlus India and its operations. We’re operating as usual and will continue to do so.Never Settle. pic.twitter.com/eAGA7iy3Xs<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2013829249690751486">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>As with so much that's going on in the world today, the change in strategy is likely motivated by political headwinds between the U.S. and China. The way I see it, OPPO doesn't want OnePlus to draw too much attention to itself (lest it invite scrutiny into the broader business), so while you'll still get OnePlus phones in the U.S., don't count on it having a retail presence — that boat has sailed with the failed T-Mobile collaboration.</p><p>OnePlus North America told Android Central that "OnePlus North America continues to operate, with full guarantee of users’ after-sales support, software updates, and rights commitments."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZS8ks88Dxp57PZb9kCs4vS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZS8ks88Dxp57PZb9kCs4vS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But this doesn't mean OnePlus itself is going away — far from it. The brand isn't changing how it's doing business in India, and although sales in the country declined last year, it continues to have a sizable presence. The manufacturer had a glitzy launch event for the OnePlus 15R in India, where it booked an entire palace, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-expands-its-mid-tier-lineup">Nord 5 and Nord CE5</a> devices continue to sell really well in India's mid-range category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sYQUbPN5wNAY4xRSM55NQ6" name="oneplus-nord-4-4.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sYQUbPN5wNAY4xRSM55NQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We asked Jitesh Ubrani, Research Manager of Worldwide Device Trackers at IDC, if he thought there was any validity to OnePlus closing its doors or winding down the brand. He told us, "I certainly haven’t heard anything along these lines from the grapevine. However, given OnePlus’ trajectory in the past few years, it would be plausible that OPPO is planning on winding down the brand. OnePlus’ share has been declining, marketing spend seemingly dwindling, and it certainly has pivoted away from being the challenger brand that it set out to be when it first launched."</p><p>"Other established brands have successfully fended off OnePlus across all channels and markets," Ubrani continued. "Think about Pixel, Galaxy FE series, and other similar products which offer great hardware and lower prices than many flagships. If the story holds true, it would be the natural conclusion of OPPO slowly chipping away at OnePlus’ operating budget, starting with when they decided to combine codebases for ColorOS and OxygenOS."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5126px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="knTtyyXRVbhUCB9gBC86mW" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 camera review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/knTtyyXRVbhUCB9gBC86mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5126" height="2887" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no doubting that OnePlus doesn't have any of the freedom it enjoyed as a standalone entity under BBK. The company doesn't have a distinct design, camera, or software teams, and the OxygenOS 16 software you get on the OnePlus 15 is identical to ColorOS 16 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">OPPO Find X9 Pro</a> — the only difference is the change in name.</p><p>That said, OPPO isn't willing to squander the cachet OnePlus built up in India over the course of the last decade. It may be rethinking how to position OnePlus as a manufacturer in the U.S. and U.K., but as far as I can see, it's staying the course in India and China — its two biggest markets by an overwhelming margin. India itself is responsible for well over half of OnePlus's annual sales, so it makes sense that the manufacturer is staying the course in the region.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The OnePlus 13 was a standout phone that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">earned a rare 5/5 review score from Android Central</a>, and delivered more at a lower price point than even the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. OnePlus proceeded to lose its way with the OnePlus 15, leaning too hard into battery life and gaming performance at the expensive of durability. The OnePlus 13 was a well-rounded phone that excelled in performance, display quality, camera hardware, and battery life, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> tossed that identity aside.</p><p>The OnePlus 15's specs were perplexing because the OnePlus 13 was already a long-lasting flagship phone. It had a 6,000mAh battery capacity with support for fast charging and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</a>. Of course, many of us won't say no to more battery, but expanding capacity shouldn't come at the expense of other features. In this case, the OnePlus 15's gargantuan 7,300mAh battery capacity and gaming focus did come at the expensive of other areas, like display quality and camera performance.</p><p>OnePlus might not be learning from its mistake, if this OnePlus 16 rumor is any indication. A post from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnePlusClub/status/2012869586593382439" target="_blank">OnePlus Club on X (formerly Twitter)</a> claims that the OnePlus 15's successor will sport a next-generation Glacier Battery with an even higher capacity. Specifically, the rumor claims the OnePlus 16 will have a capacity "approaching 9,000mAh." Details are sparse, and it's unclear what the exact battery capacity of the OnePlus 16 might be.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OnePlus 16 will be equipped with next-generation Glacier Battery with a capacity approaching 9,000mAh pic.twitter.com/kxq1wpSKx7<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2012869586593382439">January 18, 2026</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>However, if true, the OnePlus 16's rumored high-capacity battery could spell bad news for the rest of the flagship smartphone.</p><p>OnePlus uses a few tricks to cram high-capacity battery cells into relatively small smartphones. The brand employs what it calls a Glacier Battery, which is a high-density, silicon-carbon battery developed in collaboration with CATL, a leading battery manufacturer. This technology helps OnePlus fit large batteries into small packages while managing thermals. OnePlus also splits large overall batteries into smaller dual-cell designs on phones like the OnePlus 15.</p><p>But even when using silicon-carbon battery chemistry and Glacier Battery designs, there are limits to how small a smartphone battery can get at high capacities. If the OnePlus 16's battery capacity will truly approach 9,000mAh in size, it's reasonable to expect these cells to take up more space inside the phone. It's possible that OnePlus might have to make similar compromises on the OnePlus 16 to hit this target as it did on the OnePlus 15 this generation.</p><p>It's very early in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-16">OnePlus 16 rumor cycle</a>, and everything is up in the air. Recent leaks have pointed to the OnePlus 16 course-correcting OnePlus' mistakes with the OnePlus 15. It has already been billed as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-16-could-fix-the-camera-problem-fans-have-been-complaining-about-for-years">most well-rounded OnePlus phone in years</a>. The OnePlus 16's rumored ~9,000mAh battery capacity could come in natural conflict with that possibility.</p><h2 id="the-oneplus-16-needs-more-than-battery-life-and-performance-2">The OnePlus 16 needs more than battery life and performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KusTsaLQg8RFtQmvPspsng" name="OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KusTsaLQg8RFtQmvPspsng.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To be clear, if the OnePlus 16 offers fast performance, long battery life, stellar camera quality, stylish design, and more, I'll have little reason to complain. However, that sounds like the perfect smartphone, and devices are never perfect. There are always compromises, like how the OnePlus 15 sacrificed display resolution and camera quality in exchange for better stability while gaming, higher refresh rates, and longer battery life.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OnePlus 16✅ Upgraded Display (240Hz RR)✅ Upgraded Camera (200MP Periscope)✅ Upgraded Battery (~9000mAh)✅ Upgraded Speakers (Coaxial speakers)✅ Upgraded Haptics (New Motor) pic.twitter.com/WYLpWdFQXt<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2013244383714283974">January 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The OnePlus 15's trade-offs were uninspiring for a few reasons. Notably, the OnePlus 15's hallmark support of 165Hz refresh rates is only available on a few apps. If you don't happen to use the apps and games that support the ultra-high refresh rates, the OnePlus 15 gives you worse display quality without any of the benefits. The phone also has a tendency to run warm in certain situations, which isn't ideal for a gaming-focused flagship.</p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">we've tested the OnePlus 15's cameras to perform well</a> in many cases, it's hard to justify paying more for less, and that's what OnePlus is asking customers to do here. The OnePlus 15's camera hardware is a downgrade compared to the OnePlus 13, and there's no Hasselblad processing. The OnePlus DetailMax engine is solid, but some OnePlus fans will miss the old style of image processing.</p><p>With these shortcomings in mind, it's very easy to make the case that the OnePlus 13 is a more well-rounded smartphone than the OnePlus 15. It's proof that battery life isn't everything. If the OnePlus 16 indeed plans to increase battery capacity by a significant margin yet again, the company must ensure this doesn't hurt the phone's overall versatility.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2b60f018-5b88-4cce-b04f-ada8fcc37e2d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HqJrSRiJ88qiG2VrMHNpLd.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15 in Sand Storm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A mixed bag</strong></em></p><p>While the OnePlus 15 is impressive in its gaming performance and long-lasting battery, it's disappointing in others.

The notifications that Samsung is seemingly preparing all concern your Galaxy Ring's battery and its connection status. The tipster located a string of code that says "long_time_disconnect_reminder_notification_desc."</p><p>From this string, the accompanying description informs the user to connect their Galaxy Ring to check its battery. Moreover, it also alerts users to charge their Ring "regularly" to avoid a full battery drain.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster discovered that Samsung will also inform you about how long your Galaxy Ring has been disconnected. This is also under a "disconnect reminder" string in the Ring's manager app code.</p><p>A final discovery might help ensure users don't leave their Galaxy Ring if they've forgotten it. AssembleDebug lists one notification that your device will notify you of your Ring's power level at the time it loses connection with it. The post speculates that this could help users in a myriad of ways, such as issues with syncing that might've jumbled its connection with your phone.</p><p>While these new alerts were found early in the Ring's manager app code, there's no telling when they could roll out. The tipster purports an update could be right around the corner.</p><h2 id="upgrades-where-it-counts-2">Upgrades where it counts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9wPj8zFQaSiTVnHX45ETkj" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-in-case" alt="Samsung Galaxy Ring in charging case with lid open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9wPj8zFQaSiTVnHX45ETkj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Ring is Samsung's first step into the world of smart rings, and it's not without its issues, as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/galaxy-rings-swollen-battery-incident-raises-safety-concerns-for-users-everywhere">started experiencing a battery swelling</a> problem.

With the X3 Pro, however, RayNeo has an ambitious goal: making smart glasses with a heads-up display. As a result, the glasses cost considerably more than the rest of the brand's offerings, and coming in at $1,099, they're nowhere as accessible as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/air-3s-pro-rayneo-best-xr-glasses-are-true-game-changer">Air 3S Pro</a> or the Air 4 Pro.</p><p>Obviously, a lot of the interest in this category has to do with the $799 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a>, and RayNeo is touting several benefits: its smart glasses have binocular lenses, a 30-degree FoV (Meta does 20 degrees), go up to 6,000 nits (versus 5,000 with Meta), and they use a micro-LED optical light engine with a full-color diffractive waveguide, with Meta going with a geometric waveguide.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xkUdBuXdQeCK9P5aBBV4hV" name="RayNeo X3 Pro" alt="RayNeo X3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xkUdBuXdQeCK9P5aBBV4hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the hardware, the glasses are powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 platform, feature a 12MP Sony IMX681 sensor that shoots photos and videos, have a 640x480 resolution with 60Hz refresh, built-in audio, and a 245mAh battery.</p><p>Coming to the software, the X3 Pro runs the custom AIOS, and it gets real-time translation alongside Google Gemini integration and turn-by-turn navigation. I demoed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">X2 Pro at MWC 2025</a>, and it was exciting to see real-time translation — that's the kind of tech that actually makes a difference. The X3 Pro includes that feature as standard, and you also get a smattering of AI (obviously), along with a host of built-in features — a to-do list, AI recorder, and a host of other things.</p><h2 id="these-are-among-the-most-powerful-ar-glasses-yet-2">These are among the most powerful AR glasses yet</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fRQeXsy7a7onhVfNyLxmZV" name="RayNeo X3 Pro" alt="RayNeo X3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fRQeXsy7a7onhVfNyLxmZV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>RayNeo deserves credit for making the X3 Pro considerably thinner and more consumer-friendly than its predecessor; while the glasses still look a little chunky at 76g, they're not particularly uncomfortable to wear. The styling could've been better, as the X3 Pro makes it quite evident that it's a tech-focused product — Meta does a much better job in this regard.</p><p>But you get used to the weight after a while, and the best part of the X3 Pro has to be the built-in micro-LED panel. The heads-up view makes it highly convenient to parse information, and it isn't distracting. Having used Even Realities' G2 and other smart glasses in recent weeks, I really like what RayNeo did with the X3 Pro, and the light engine gets bright enough that it wasn't an issue even while using the glasses outdoors.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="6GHgDqP6kq9gawKZTfN9PV" name="RayNeo X3 Pro" alt="RayNeo X3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6GHgDqP6kq9gawKZTfN9PV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4916" height="2769" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="VAumzrFt9CvWJs98vmJPaV" name="RayNeo X3 Pro" alt="RayNeo X3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VAumzrFt9CvWJs98vmJPaV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FTDtmcwjHdE8FiqTubVGeV" name="RayNeo X3 Pro" alt="RayNeo X3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FTDtmcwjHdE8FiqTubVGeV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4827px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EW7auddvzP2yDXLz6adKPV" name="RayNeo X3 Pro" alt="RayNeo X3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EW7auddvzP2yDXLz6adKPV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4827" height="2719" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZAd3ccgokKVQh9JNEw9GSV" name="RayNeo X3 Pro" alt="RayNeo X3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZAd3ccgokKVQh9JNEw9GSV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>You get a physical power button along with a shutter button on the right side of the frame, and there's a gesture control area on the right and left sides that makes it easy to navigate the interface. There's a decent set of utilities bundled with the glasses, and RayNeo did a good job with the UI. It's easy enough to pair the glasses with RayNeo's mobile app, and you get a good rundown of all the available features.</p><p>The X3 Pro does a good job with real-time translation, and this was my biggest use case by a wide margin. Invoking Gemini is pretty straightforward as well, and you even get the ability to sideload apps as the glasses effectively run a custom Android build. Oh, and there's a camera cutout in the middle to accommodate the 12MP lens. The photos and videos you get out of the camera is decent enough, and I'd put it in line with Meta's glasses. On that note, the built-in audio is pretty great, and it's fun to be able to listen to music via the glasses.</p><h2 id="middling-battery-life-makes-these-glasses-unusable-2">Middling battery life makes these glasses unusable</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="whM2d33tUQMdk8JVbsVbfV" name="RayNeo X3 Pro" alt="RayNeo X3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whM2d33tUQMdk8JVbsVbfV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, I didn't do that a lot because of one factor: battery life. While RayNeo touts a five-hour battery life, that's nowhere close to what you actually get in real-world usage. I couldn't get the glasses to last more than 30 minutes, and you can see the battery life plummet while doing mundane tasks. Even updating the glasses drained the battery so much that I had to charge the glasses, and it makes tasks like AR navigation pointless if your destination is more than 10 minutes away.</p><p>The glasses charge over USB-C, and while they don't take a long time to charge, there's just no getting around the fact that these aren't anywhere close to being ready for all-day use. There are other quibbles with network connectivity and errant crashes, but those issues got resolved with a software update — while the battery life continues to be a dealbreaker when you consider just how much the X3 Pro costs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4KjBwoCsGqmT6QNcDn83eV" name="RayNeo X3 Pro" alt="RayNeo X3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KjBwoCsGqmT6QNcDn83eV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no denying that RayNeo did a great job delivering AR glasses with a diverse feature-set, but ultimately, the poor battery life makes the glasses unusable. I'd like to see a bigger battery with the next generation, because there is a lot to like with the X3 Pro in general; RayNeo just needs to get these glasses to last a few hours at least.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The device marked what's considered to be a significant shift in battery and power.

The company acquired famed Apple designer Jony Ive's startup "io" in a $6.5 billion deal last year. The design lead behind the iPhone and more, plus his entire team, is now under OpenAI's roof working on an innovative hardware product. Now, we have a better idea of when OpenAI actually plans to unveil and release this secretive AI-powered device.</p><p>In an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.axios.com/2026/01/19/openai-device-2026-lehane-jony-ive" target="_blank">Axios</a>, OpenAI's Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane said that the company is "on track" to reveal its first product in the second half of 2026. The confirmation is the closest thing we've gotten to a timeline for OpenAI hardware. The company, including its CEO Sam Altman, has been teasing an upcoming AI device, but details have been sparse.</p><p>Notably, Lehane wouldn't commit to OpenAI's hardware product being available for purchase this year — we might see a reveal in 2026 and general availability in 2027. The OpenAI policy leader added that the company was "looking at something in the latter part [of 2026]," per the report.</p><p>Information regarding OpenAI's mysterious entry into consumer hardware products has been slowly trickling out since the May 2025 announcement.

We really haven't seen an innovative new form factor find success since the smartphone and the smartwatch. Other emerging wearables, like earbuds and smart glasses, are making noise — but they're far from becoming ubiquitous. Does OpenAI's first consumer product have the potential to change that?</p><p>We don't know enough about OpenAI's plans to know for sure. However, the company seems fixed in its position that it will focus on an audio-based device, and that gives me confidence. Screen-based consumer technology products will always compete with existing form factors, like smartphones and smartwatches, which is an uphill battle.</p><p>That's true even of products that think outside the box in their implementation of displays, like Humane's AI Pin. That now-discontinued device used a tiny projector to display images on your hand. At the end of the day, a screen is still a screen. Humane's once-hyped AI product fizzled out very quickly, leaving early adopters high and dry.</p><p>It's a similar story for the Rabbit R1, another screen-based AI device that never caught on. To Rabbit's credit, the company is still supporting the device and recently overhauled the operating system. Even with that in mind, we're not likely to see the Rabbit R1 — or anything similar — disrupt the smartphone or smartwatch form factor.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP" name="rabbit-r1-vision.jpg" alt="Vision mode on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, it feels like audio-based devices still have room to grow. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-used-plaud-note-ai-note-taking-device-and-its-much-better-than-i-imagined-but-theres-an-issue">AI voice recorders are finding a niche in the business world</a> despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-wore-an-ai-voice-recorder-on-my-wrist-for-a-week-heres-how-it-went">offering the same functionality as your smartphone</a>.

OpenAI seems to be listening and rising to the occasion. The company confirmed an audio focus for its upcoming product, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/openais-first-steps-into-ai-hardware-leaks-and-it-looks-like-a-pair-of-earbuds">leaks suggest it could take the form of earbuds</a>.</p><p>The teasers, leaks, and rumors all point to the same thing. OpenAI is putting its hardware efforts in the right direction, avoiding screen-based devices that'll always lose against the smartphone. Instead, it's supposedly leaning into audio, and it sounds like a winning strategy. Based on today's announcement, we might learn more about what this product might look like later this year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, prominent Weibo tipster Digital Chat Station (DCS) says there's more to those rumors, like a second variant (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2026/01/18/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-6-pro-ultra-pro-max-2nm/">Gizmochina</a>). DCS claims that Qualcomm is working on a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6 Pro, alongside the expected 8 Elite Gen 6 in 2026. The tipster alleges that the chip bears model number SMSM8975, a slightly modified title from what was reported for the basic Gen 6.</p><p>Either way, the tipster says that this Gen 6 Pro would only be reserved for "high-end imaging flagships." Their social media post adds that this is speculative at this time.</p><p>The publication adds that further statements from the tipster state that Qualcomm could look to make this Pro chip available for "Ultra" phones. Moreover, the Gen 6 Pro is rumored to be a "full-performance" flagship-level chip, likely to boost Ultra devices over Plus and base models using the standard or original Gen 6.</p><p>Aside from the rumors, it's unclear just what strengths a Gen 6 Pro could have over the base version. With how things are positioned, it <em>sounds </em>like a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">For Galaxy</a>" situation, where Samsung's version is overclocked, squeezing a little more speed (GHz) out of the Snapdragon chip. We can take this Pro rumor with a grain of salt for now, and see where we're at later this year.</p><h2 id="what-s-elite-could-go-pro-2">What's Elite could go Pro</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="usWcanYWioWojs5zc7yGDK" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-hero" alt="Internal view of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/usWcanYWioWojs5zc7yGDK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're several months out (at least) from any sort of Qualcomm announcements, but we've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/your-next-android-phone-could-get-unmatched-speed-but-it-comes-at-a-price">already got rumors</a> about the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6 to toy with.

It's already been rumored that this chip will be built off TSMC's 2nm process (for the Gen 6, too), which could bring an amped up N2P for performance and power consumption improvements.</p><p>Other rumors from last November claim the chip could even support LPDDR6 RAM and UFS 5.0 storage for efficiency purposes.</p><p>We've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-price-is-reportedly-stuck-in-limbo-thanks-to-rising-memory-costs">been hearing warnings</a> that phones could rise in price this year, and rumors about Qualcomm's next chip are along those lines. Supposedly, Qualcomm's next-gen tech for its 8 Elite Gen 6 is expensive.

One significant change the publication noticed was within its patch notes for fixes. Samsung has finally fixed a long-standing DIY Home layout issue that's plagued Galaxy users for quite some time. The post says this fix concerns a "misalignment" issue the feature previously suffered, as well as a backup/restore fix for widgets when switching phones.</p><p>As far as what's new, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/incoming-glow-up-samsungs-bixby-huge-one-ui-8-5-upgrade-might-look-like-google">One UI 8.5</a>-focused Home Up version adds widget size and blur (app icon backgrounds) control.</p><p>Samsung Galaxy devices still offer the classic buttons for UI maneuvers, alongside gesture controls. The publication states this next change concerns the latter, as a "bottom swipe" option appears. Users can reportedly quickly hop to their "last used app" with this. Elsewhere, the Edge Panel now merges apps, people, and tasks into its domain, so users have a one-stop shop.</p><p>Lastly, the latest Home Up version lets users customize their Share Manager. If there are apps you typically use, or some that you never share content to, you can make the appropriate changes to clear up that menu clutter. To reiterate, this is rolling out for users enrolled in the One UI 8.5 beta via the Galaxy Store.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-home-levels-up-2">Samsung's Home (levels) Up</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:301px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:199.34%;"><img id="U73MmSrai4kdrCchkUUFX" name="smausng-home-up-share-menu-changes" alt="Samsung's Home Up module for Good Lock beta tests a Share Manager change, which lets users customize the apps that appear when sharing content." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U73MmSrai4kdrCchkUUFX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="301" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:291px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:206.19%;"><img id="JwJUNo8KNXYabHZC3mxkX" name="samsung-home-up-one-ui-8-5-beta-egde-panel" alt="Good Lock's Home Up module tests an Edge Panel change that merges apps, tasks, and people into one convenient place." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JwJUNo8KNXYabHZC3mxkX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="291" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It's been a while since we heard anything about Good Lock's Home Up, especially after that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-home-up-complete-customize-demo">fun, wacky update early last year</a>.

For context, they stated that the 128GB Pixel 10a is expected to cost approximately €500, representing a €50 price drop compared to its predecessor.</p><p>However, another new leak suggests that Google may leave the price of the Pixel 10a untouched. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/google-pixel-10a-on-vous-devoile-leurs-veritables-prix-et-dates-de-commercialisation-60875">Dealabs</a> states that because of rising component costs for RAM and storage, Google is more likely to keep the price stick to the  €549 for the 128GB model and €649 for the 256GB model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Qu8ZxHb3W2n22gWQViGmqg" name="Google-pixel-10-a-renders" alt="CAD renders of the Pixel 10a leak online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qu8ZxHb3W2n22gWQViGmqg.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Recent reports suggest that the LPDDR5X RAM, commonly used in the Pixel series, is experiencing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/nvidias-demand-for-lpddr5x-could-double-smartphone-and-server-memory-prices-in-2026-seismic-shift-means-even-smartphone-class-memory-isnt-safe-from-ai-induced-crunch">significant price increases due to supply issues</a>, thanks to the rising demand in the AI-sector.

All the reasons why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">E Ink tablets</a> are excellent for reading also apply to why art looks stunning on e-paper screens. After all, frozen particles of e-ink are perfect for showcasing art that's meant to be printed on paper with real ink.</p><p>However, instead of paying for new prints individually, you can change pieces at will for free with a digital frame. And with an E Ink frame, art doesn't have to lose its soul or require too much power.</p><p>The SwitchBot AI Art Frame isn't the first of its kind, but it is one of the more mainstream e-paper frames, as the brand has built quite a name for itself. Brands like IONNYK tried to popularize the concept a few years back, but it wasn't until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.abt.com/blog/ces-2025-introducing-the-pocketbook-inkposter">PocketBook unveiled a colored variant at CES 2025</a> that the idea started to catch on.</p><p>Since SwitchBot already has an ecosystem of smart home devices and several Matter-enabled hubs, the addition of an e-paper frame felt like a natural extension. I imagined I'd be able to incorporate the frame into automations created through the SwitchBot hub, and I was half right, but the AI Art Frame turned out to be a bit simpler.</p><h2 id="switchbot-is-by-far-the-cheapest-option-for-e-ink-digital-frames-2">SwitchBot is by far the cheapest option for E Ink digital frames</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3967px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rLSVJTZ9YCMvBsmZ65vvgf" name="switchbot-ai-art-frame-lifestyle-6" alt="SwitchBot AI Art Frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLSVJTZ9YCMvBsmZ65vvgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3967" height="2231" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tz9uMoFxrN5cgdha8cz3cf" name="switchbot-ai-art-frame-lifestyle-9" alt="SwitchBot AI Art Frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tz9uMoFxrN5cgdha8cz3cf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Much like Aura, PocketBook InkPoster, and other competitors, SwitchBot offers the AI Art Frame in several sizes. Here's a quick comparison of sizes and prices of color E Ink frames to give you an idea of the industry standard. All the frames mentioned below use the same E Ink Spectra 6 color display and charge via USB-C.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>SwitchBot</p></th><th  ><p>Alternatives</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>7.3" for $149.99</p></td><td  ><p>7" for €189/$220 (<a href="https://paperlesspaper.de/en/buy-7-inch-epaper-picture-frame">paper 7</a>)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>13.3" for $349.99</p></td><td  ><p>13" for $499 (<a href="https://auraframes.com/ink">Aura Ink</a>)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>31.5" for $1,299.99</p></td><td  ><p>31.5" for $1,699 (<a href="https://global.inkposter.com/products/inkposter-affresco-31-5">InkPoster Affresco</a>)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see, the SwitchBot AI Art Frame is the cheapest in the market, regardless of what size you prefer.</p><p>All these colorful E Ink frames can store images locally, support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, support both portrait and landscape orientations, and be managed via Android or iOS apps. SwitchBot is limited to 10 images stored on board, while InkPoster is limited to six. Aura claims to have "unlimited photos," but those are cloud uploads, which are unlimited for all frames anyway. There's no info available on local storage.</p><p>Two things set SwitchBot's offering apart from the rest: AI and scheduling.</p><h2 id="the-good-and-the-bad-2">The good and the bad...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aDjEohGHaJCmcT3TvsFXtf" name="switchbot-ai-art-frame-lifestyle-7" alt="SwitchBot AI Art Frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aDjEohGHaJCmcT3TvsFXtf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Besides the usual suspects, the SwitchBot AI Art Frame offers granular scheduling and generative AI art.</p><p>You can choose a specific image and the time of the day when you want that photo to swap over. Since this is done through the SwitchBot app, I'm hoping to see SwitchBot expand this further by incorporating smart home automations with the brand's other products in the future.</p><p>It should be possible via over-the-air updates, as the hardware is already there. I don't know if this will come to pass, and I'm a little disappointed that SwitchBot didn't do more with smart home integration.</p><p>The AI Studio generates images either from text prompts alone or by reimagining an uploaded image based on your text prompt. The AI feature isn't free, though. You need to subscribe to the $3.99 per month plan, and that limits you to 400 monthly gen AI creations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4413px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.61%;"><img id="XaE9QitR2EyHs5wRansVDg" name="switchbot-ai-art-frame-app-ai-studio" alt="SwitchBot AI Art Frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XaE9QitR2EyHs5wRansVDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4413" height="2410" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I honestly don't see what's stopping anyone from generating an image for free from any other gen AI platform. The subscription service feels like a shameless cash grab, but that isn't even my main issue with this.</p><p>I don't think anyone should equate AI and art in any way, shape, or form. AI literally steals human artists' work by plagiarizing it. Countless digital artists, designers, and professionals in the creative space have pushed back against generative AI. To then capitalize on this pretty unethical.</p><p>This would've been so much more refreshing if SwitchBot had partnered with actual artists from around the world, or maybe even with art platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.deviantart.com/">DeviantArt</a>. I would happily pay a monthly subscription to access the painstaking work of an artist if it meant supporting them, as would many others.</p><h2 id="e-ink-adds-battery-gains-as-opposed-to-regular-lcds-2">E Ink adds battery gains as opposed to regular LCDs</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bvQc2JpxZ4tKtMHMepSjyf" name="switchbot-ai-art-frame-lifestyle-4" alt="SwitchBot AI Art Frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bvQc2JpxZ4tKtMHMepSjyf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ox6K9EJnVCbJqT2yc8Rmqf" name="switchbot-ai-art-frame-lifestyle-5" alt="SwitchBot AI Art Frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ox6K9EJnVCbJqT2yc8Rmqf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3744px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="odFp236ZJAeocVvrgo8tff" name="switchbot-ai-art-frame-lifestyle-3" alt="SwitchBot AI Art Frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/odFp236ZJAeocVvrgo8tff.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3744" height="2106" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3935px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8sTNsktwoueTdmubo8k2Wf" name="switchbot-ai-art-frame-lifestyle-8" alt="SwitchBot AI Art Frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8sTNsktwoueTdmubo8k2Wf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3935" height="2213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>SwitchBot guarantees up to two years of battery life per charge.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It's no secret that smartphones are incredibly mature, and the days of justifying annual upgrades are over. Processors are fast, displays are crisp, cameras are sharp, and crucially, phone makers are supporting devices for longer than ever with up to seven years of Android OS upgrades. On the flip side, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget devices</a> are winning the price-to-performance ratio, but they often fall short in one major area: memory.</p><p>Frankly, it's easy to switch from the most expensive Android phones to the cheapest ones. I've recently moved from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-review">TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER</a>, and these are phones priced roughly $900 apart. Sure, one feels snappier and more premium, although both handle all my daily needs perfectly fine. I can live with a budget processor, display, or camera, but doing the same with low RAM is much trickier.</p><p>There's no better example of this than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a>. Despite the Pixel 9a being the newest A-series Pixel available, it continually misses out on new AI features, presumably due to memory constraints.</p><h2 id="the-google-pixel-9a-started-at-a-major-disadvantage-2">The Google Pixel 9a started at a major disadvantage</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Jg4AvwDNzbB79PpfkmD4DE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a next to Pixel 9 and 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jg4AvwDNzbB79PpfkmD4DE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ideally, you want to buy a phone with future-proofing in mind. To keep a phone for a half decade or longer, it's essential to pick a device based on your needs today <em>and</em> in the future. This is why it's recommended to upgrade the storage configuration of your smartphone if you can afford it, because it'll give you the room to take on photos, videos, media, and apps as you live with a device for years.</p><p>As a result, it's hard to justify purchasing a phone that's already behind the curve on day one. Those limitations will only become more apparent as time goes on. However, that's what Google is asking Pixel 9a buyers to do. This phone ships with only 8GB of memory, which is much less than you'll find on the rest of the Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 series.</p><p>This is a modest amount of RAM that will be fine for daily use, until you want to use on-device AI. Artificial intelligence demands large amounts of available RAM. Since the Pixel 9a only has 8GB of RAM, it can't utilize <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">the latest Gemini Nano models</a> with multimodality. It has to use the Gemini Nano XXS model, which is a text-only model that only runs when it's needed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DVEdsb9wpdwVpsKE3f8dnB" name="google-pixel-9-pixel-screenshots-01.jpg" alt="Using the Pixel Screenshots app on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DVEdsb9wpdwVpsKE3f8dnB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">Pixel 10 series</a> use Gemini Nano models that run all the time and utilize multimodality to handle text, audio, and visuals simultaneously. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">only the Gemini Nano XXS model</a>, the Pixel 9a started at a disadvantage in terms of feature set. It missed out on Pixel Screenshots and Call Notes, which are features that every mainline Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 series phone received.</p><p>It's possible that you consider the lack of AI features a benefit instead of a drawback. Some would rather not have their phone riddled with unwanted AI tools. However, when the Pixel 9a launched, I suspected this would only be the beginning of the feature omissions for this phone. Google's promise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">seven years of Android OS upgrades and regular Pixel Drops</a> won't mean much if the Pixel 9a misses out on the best features.</p><p>Not even a year into the Pixel 9a's existence, it's already starting to miss out on more new features. Scam Detection won't work on the Pixel 9a in certain regions. Additionally, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-set-up-use-android-ai-notification-summaries">AI notification summaries</a> aren't available on the Pixel 9a. These are just a few features introduced with recent Pixel Drops that aren't available on Google's current midranger.</p><h2 id="some-features-simply-can-t-use-cloud-processing-2">Some features simply can't use cloud processing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RYKtchGujQTye3ognV9Prg" name="Notification-Summaries-Android" alt="The notification summaries feature on a Pixel running Android 16." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RYKtchGujQTye3ognV9Prg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Theoretically, the Pixel 9a's onboard memory limitations shouldn't be much of an issue. Lots of AI processing can be offloaded to the cloud for additional power. Google Pixel 9a users can still use Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini Live</a>, Nano Banana, and plenty more AI features that leverage the cloud. The handset can even use some on-device AI features, like Google Recorder transcription, since these features use older models that predate Gemini Nano.</p><p>The issue is that some AI features you really don't want processed in the cloud to protect your privacy. It's possible Google <em>could</em> bring Call Notes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a>, and AI notification summaries to the Pixel 9a via cloud processing. But that would mean your calls, screenshots, and notifications being sent to Google servers for privacy. It's an option on paper, but not in reality.</p><p>The other reason certain AI features run on the device is for speed. It takes time to transmit data to a cloud server, process it, and return it to your device. In some applications, this rules out cloud processing as a viable option.</p><p>To sum up, features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel" target="_blank">Call Notes</a> and AI notification summaries need to be processed on your device for low-latency responses and security, but they can't be on the Pixel 9a due to its RAM shortcomings.</p><h2 id="every-other-smartphone-part-has-effectively-peaked-2">Every other smartphone part has effectively peaked</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rY5945qajwXSW5rKd3gTRE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a back on a red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rY5945qajwXSW5rKd3gTRE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is behind, even in comparison to other Android midrangers. The Samsung Galaxy A56 is configurable with up to 12GB of RAM, while the OnePlus 15R offers 12GB of memory as standard. To be fair, this is not a problem exclusive to Google phones, or the Pixel 9a specifically. The aforementioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A56 gets "Awesome Intelligence" features instead of Galaxy AI</a> due to its lower standard memory than flagship Galaxy phones.</p><p>In 2026, whether you use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> or a newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> chip is inconsequential for most users. The same goes for Apple, Qualcomm, or Google smartphone processors. There are clear differences between them, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500" target="_blank">we have benchmarks to demonstrate that</a>, but the bottom line is that <em>every</em> modern system-on-a-chip (SoC) can handle the basics for the vast majority of customers.</p><p>While almost every other smartphone part has peaked, phones will always require more RAM to accommodate newer, more demanding AI features. The Google Pixel 9a is proof of what can happen if you ignore the RAM specification of your next smartphone. It's perhaps the only smartphone spec that still matters, because without enough of it, you'll be left without the latest and greatest features.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But that's all changed with laptops like the Honor MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon, phones like the Honor 400 Pro and Honor Magic V5, and now the Honor Magic 8 Pro.</p><p>Some of this is Honor's close relationship with Google, which now allows the company to sit among the elite few offering seven full years of OS updates for its top-tier phones, Magic 8 Pro included, as well as deeply-nested integration with core services like Gemini.</p><p>Plus, Honor is doubling down on what makes its phones great and unique, like a camera that produces near DSLR quality imagery from its 200MP telephoto sensor, or a display that not only pushes class-leading brightness but doesn't forget that humans have to look at its visage during all hours of the day without getting eye strain. The Magic 8 Pro is a phone unlike any Honor has built before, and it makes recommending it a breeze.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-price-availability-and-specs"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Price, availability, and specs</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rw8SQUe3bPzYXRefnBZChi" name="honor-magic-8-pro-magic-os-10-android-16-update" alt="The Magic OS 10 logo on the Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rw8SQUe3bPzYXRefnBZChi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic 8 Pro is available across Europe as of January 7, 2026, starting at £1,099.99/€1,299 for the model with 12GB RAM and 512GB storage.

It ditches the overly boxy design for slightly curvier edges that are more ergonomic, features comfortable rounded corners, and even sports a thinner, lighter chassis. In short, it's a joy to hold and use daily.</p><p>The front and back glass feature the same curve on all four edges, further helping to ensure this is a very comfortable phone to use. The problem with curved glass is that it makes it difficult to find a good tempered glass screen protector. The phone ships with a pre-applied film protector, but there's nothing quite like the protection offered by tempered glass.</p><p>The build itself also received an upgrade from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>, now sporting IP69K ingress protection, stronger glass, and haptics that are <em>finally</em> good.

While it's large, it's still a better design than most of the company's competition, as the island is not only centered (so it doesn't wobble on a table), but it's also totally flat. A large camera island also means the phone is a wedge shape on a table, with an underside that's easily grippable when compared to most flat phones.</p><p>The new side key, located below the power button, acts as a multifunction key to call up the new AI assistant, quickly launch the camera, zoom, and take photos or videos in the viewfinder, and more.

The Magic 8 Pro's OLED is as good as LTPO OLEDs get today, with a 1-120Hz refresh rate range and a class-leading measured peak brightness of 3,600 nits.</p><p>It offers tons of color customization options, including detailed sliders for contrast, saturation, RGB, and more than most other companies. The company has also outfitted the phone with two dimming options: an eye-friendly DC dimming mode above 20% brightness and comfortable 3840Hz or 4320Hz PWM modes at low brightness.</p><p>Honor even shipped the phone with a new flicker detection tool so you can check the flicker rate of nasty LEDs around you, something never before done by a smartphone company. It's a substantial upgrade over anything Samsung, Google, or Apple offers on their phones, and additional eye care options ensure nearly everyone will find this phone's display comfortable, even for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> people.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-battery-life-performance-and-software"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Battery life, performance, and software</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GyYGuNgE8oYQcdQ9n2CCVh" name="honor-magic-8-pro-battery-life" alt="Battery stats on the Honor Magic 8 Pro showing the epic battery life" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GyYGuNgE8oYQcdQ9n2CCVh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>MagicOS 10 (based on Android 16) represents a significant step forward in UX and offers 7 years of OS updates.</strong></li><li><strong>Battery life is better than most flagship phones, with a large silicon-carbon cell and ultrafast charging with the included charger.</strong></li><li><strong>Performance is as good as it gets in 2026, although some may scoff at only 12GB RAM in a flagship at this price.</strong></li></ul><p>Honor has been leading the charge on silicon-carbon batteries for a few years now, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/electric-car-battery-tech-will-supercharge-your-next-smartphone">notable improvements this year</a> led to thinner phones with larger batteries and faster charging.

The new "stacked" multitasking UI is a direct clone of iOS's UI, but that's an actual improvement over the garbage UI stock Android still uses. But several other areas aren't an improvement, like no option to consolidate notifications and quick toggles into one notification pane, and a basic home screen launcher that lacks the customization of other Android brands.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-cameras"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Cameras</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="M9ySWyU5oXaseZKFQTTF3V" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="Taking a photo of a cat using the Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M9ySWyU5oXaseZKFQTTF3V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor began seriously focusing on (pun intended) its telephoto camera experience starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>, which debuted a 180MP camera behind that lens.

The same system is used on the main camera and ensures that your low-light photos come out looking more detailed, better exposed, feature more accurate colors, and have much less blurring than most smartphones.</p><p>It's also a giant sensor, and I don't just mean the megapixel count. A 1/1.4-inch sensor is physically large, and that size, combined with the f/2.6 lens, means you're getting impressive bokeh on every shot, not just those taken in portrait mode. Those photos look more like something from a DSLR than other smartphones can deliver, and it's the highlight of the camera experience for me.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

is easily the best part. I found myself regularly backing up just a bit so I could use the phone's 3.7x zoom more often to achieve the natural bokeh (background separation) created by such a sizable sensor.</p><p>Low-light photography is also excellent, and Honor continues to do an excellent job of capturing motion when compared to many other brands. The phone is also capable of recording video at 4K resolution and 120FPS, though I've noticed an apparent clarity drop-off at 60FPS and above when lighting isn't perfect.

Honor offers a compelling way to switch from iPhone while still retaining the ecosystem syncing that Apple offers. I use an Honor laptop, Honor phones, and occasionally an Honor tablet, and they all work exceedingly well together. Honor is also the only brand offering secure face unlock with a 3D sensor like Apple.</p><p>Samsung also offers quite a bit of added value with their phones, especially if you use a lot of Samsung products in your home. The company's OLED displays are far harsher than Honor's and give some people (like me) headaches, and I don't like Samsung's flat and sharp hardware designs at all; they're just uncomfortable to hold. Plus, you're looking at slower charging and worse battery life, but it's hard to ignore how good One UI is these days.</p><p>OnePlus offers the most balanced experience between all these phones, with even better battery life than the Magic 8 Pro. The cameras aren't as good, but Oxygen OS offers more features and a better UI, plus notably better haptics than any other choice on this list, as well as a 165Hz eye-friendly OLED that's great for gaming.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vwjTARwYsvp6TEDRMUkFni" name="honor-magic-8-pro-back-01" alt="The back of the gold Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vwjTARwYsvp6TEDRMUkFni.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want a phone that's comfortable to hold, tough, relatively light, and offers top-notch biometric options and long-term software support.</li><li>You need a phone with an eye-friendly OLED and plenty of accessiblity options.</li><li>You enjoy taking photos and want the best telephoto quality we've seen to date.</li><li>You want deep ecosystem tie-in and syncing with other Honor devices.</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy if...</strong></p><ul><li>You absolutely have to use a good tempered glass protector.</li><li>You record lots of video and want the highest quality.</li></ul><p>I've grown to really like Honor's phones and devices over the past few years, and it's now incredibly easy to recommend Honor phones as viable alternatives to Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and other brands. The company offers plenty of reasons to use its phones, including better displays and cameras, longer battery life, faster charging, and strong ecosystem integration with its other devices.</p><p>Honor could improve the video-capture experience when recording at 60FPS, especially in low light, and the phone's overall UI still needs a bit of improvement to match other brands. But the number of excellent features here, including Magic Portal, Magic Ring, and the side key with contextual AI, makes MagicOS 10 extremely compelling in ways it wasn't before.</p><p>This is an excellent phone that I'll be happy to continue using for the foreseeable future, and long-term software support helps solidify that decision. The only problem is availability, since Honor phones still aren't officially available in North America.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2859dc6b-305b-4507-be5a-bb67122ee259">            <a href="https://www.honor.com/global/phones/honor-magic8-pro/" data-model-name="Honor Magic 8 Pro" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kg9krdFGFJLBZVCtv2PuwS.jpg' alt="Honor Magic 8 Pro back panel in cyan"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Honor</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Magic 8 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Magic 8 Pro is Honor's best phone yet, offering better battery life, faster charging, an impressive photography experience, and an OLED that won't burn your eyes out in the dark.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>
