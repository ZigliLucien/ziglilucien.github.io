To me, they're just a phone, a vehicle for elaborate software, and a way to communicate with the people in your life. Okay, maybe have a little fun, too. I'm not dead inside.</p>

<p>It's not like I hate phones or other assorted tech stuff. I'm just not very passionate about them. I will talk your ear off about things like aquariums, antique cars, or woodworking. I'm very keen on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-jetson-tx2-best-development-package-next-great-idea">electronics</a>, too, just not the already-built ones.</p><p>Anyone who has ever worked with me can tell you that I <em>do</em> hate reviewing phones. I was never particularly good at it, having an eye that was a bit too critical, and I found myself unable to trust anything the manufacturer said about the product. I forced myself to be as objective as I could, not recommending products because I liked them, but because <em>you</em> might. I was there to let you know whether or not they worked as advertised.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my days of a new phone every few weeks and constantly testing things I'm not really interested in are mostly done. I'm happy to let those who are skilled at doing it have all the "fun," and I'll be available for emergencies that, thankfully, rarely happen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B84qefYvQspgvS4uvXdceD" name="HMD-Skyline-3.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B84qefYvQspgvS4uvXdceD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I do want to say that sometimes, I do want to have a look at something. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline </a>was a great example. I'm often interested in a particular thing, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD's new repairability build techniques</a>. I do make it clear why I like or dislike it, and tend to editorialize my product reviews. Better than not being honest about it, right?</p>
<p>Anyhoo, I paid my own money for the phone I'm using now (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a>) and haven't had to go through the hassle of setting anything else up and actually using it every day for about a year now. I love it; both the phone <em>and</em> not having to think about how to do anything with it.</p>

<p>I bought the Razr because I tried the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Flip 6</a>. Yeah, that sounds a little crazy, but I found that a phone that folds up into a small package made my life easier — there isn't a lot of room in your pockets when you're navigating a wheelchair all day.</p><p>I went with Motorola, despite its horrible track record with taking care of its customers by supporting its products, because there seemed to be more potential with the small front display. It does everything I need, and you know what? It does it really well. Unless something that seems better comes along, my next phone will probably be the same; here's hoping it lasts until at least 2026.</p>
<p>So, I spent a lot of words talking about what I don't like, but I love my job. That's because it's morphed into working with and writing about the things I am passionate about: software, platforms, and policy.</p><p>To me, software is elegant (or should be) and useful, even if it is constrained in a plastic and glass shell. The screen only exists to showcase the software, features are there to add value when they can, and the jumble of code and math is what makes a tech product like a phone wonderful.</p><p>I hold the companies that make them, including (and especially) Google, to the highest standards; ones they will likely be unable to meet. To me, that implies they should be working harder to improve what the user experiences.</p>

<p>Their philosophy needs to shine through their products; Apple needs to build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">pretty yet simple products</a> that are easy to use but also can be powerful if that's what you want. Google needs to set an example as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">the tender of Android</a>; show how to make the software shine and how to deal with the inevitable bugs that will happen. Samsung needs to keep finding ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review" target="_blank">give consumers what they want</a> this week, being willing to switch gears when necessary.</p><p>Other companies need to constantly try to find that one thing that sets them apart.</p><p>All this ties together through each corporation's culture and policy. Often, government policy will intertwine and help shape or force the situation. I find all of this fascinating, and even when I'm not working, I'll spend at least a few hours on the internet reading what others are seeing and thinking about it all.</p><p>In the end. I'm lucky to have a full-time gig that I enjoy doing, even if I did have to monkey with phones far too often to get where I am today.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I've almost never left the house without having (at least) two phones on me. Part of that is just the nature of the beast when you write about smartphones for a living. However, I was dual-carrying phones long before I began writing full-time.</p><p>Occasionally, I would stick to just one phone, leaving the other behind, whether it was for a special occasion or just a quick trip to the store. However, after Apple had the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">courage</a>" to drop the SIM card tray, the days of popping out the SIM from one phone and using it in another have long been gone. And given the headaches that accompany trying to get my carrier to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-esim-android" target="_blank">transfer an eSIM from one phone</a> to another, I wasn't sure if I would ever return to being "normal."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8" name="google-gemini-lock-screen-widgets-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini lock screen widgets on iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All that changed after my 15-month-old son decided that he was going to take an opportunity to try out for the Orioles. One moment, I'm walking down the hallway with him in one arm and my iPhone in the other, to turn off the lights in his room. The next thing I know, my phone was a good ten feet away from me, face down, with my son nuzzling his head into my shoulder.</p><p>Just like that, I was making an appointment at Best Buy to put my AppleCare Plus subscription to use. The first hiccup was that I needed to leave my phone there overnight, which also meant that I couldn't approve any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">2FA requests</a> needed to access my Verizon account from another device. It didn't seem like that big of a deal, as the Verizon store was in the next shopping center.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3yF4wDNb9vB86awAv3h6VE" name="apple-2fa-code-iphone-x-hero-vioj" alt="Apple ID 2FA Code on iPhone X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3yF4wDNb9vB86awAv3h6VE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Almost two hours later, I was finally able to leave Verizon with my phone number activated on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. In that time, the sales rep tried everything they could to get my eSIM transferred from the iPhone to the Fold 6. At one point, they even got their manager involved, only to come away empty-handed. It turns out that the only thing that worked was activating and inserting a physical SIM card.</p><p>Since then, I've been daily carrying just the Fold 6, and it's actually been a bit liberating. For one, my pockets are lighter, as I'm no longer carrying around an extra pound (literally 1.027 pounds). But there's also just something nice about not needing to worry about where I might have put one of my phones, or trying to decide which phone I should use to accomplish a certain task.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="f7mGPGbcitjef6WE8oaYJj" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-12.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review cover screen in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7mGPGbcitjef6WE8oaYJj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And while I do occasionally miss using my iPhone, it's been almost a month since "the incident," and I haven't felt the urge to actually go through another potential ordeal. I quite enjoy the idea of being able to just pop my SIM card out of the Fold 6 and into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. There's no need to log into my Verizon account, get on the phone with customer service, or head into a local store. Whenever I'm ready to, it'll take maybe 5 minutes, and I'll be on my merry way.</p><p>I wish I could sit here and tell you what kind of problems prevented the eSIM from being activated on the Fold 6, but neither the Verizon rep nor their manager could figure it out. For all I know, it could have just been a random glitch that happened to occur at the right moment. Maybe it's the universe's way of telling me that I don't need an iPhone *<em>he said</em>, <em>tongue in cheek.*</em></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSELHgx8GUqV28GhWJx3MZ" name="iphone-16-pro-max-sos-z-fold-6-sim-manager-1" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max SOS mode next to Z Fold 6 SIM Card Manager" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSELHgx8GUqV28GhWJx3MZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's weird is that I haven't run into these kinds of problems when moving eSIMs from carriers like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mint-mobile/is-this-a-typo-mint-mobile-is-currently-selling-the-google-pixel-9-for-less-than-the-pixel-9a">Mint Mobile</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">Visible</a> to other devices. Instead, I only ever deal with issues when it comes to the Verizon eSIM housing my personal mobile number. This leads me to believe it's something on Verizon's end, which also wouldn't come as a shock given how difficult carriers have made it to switch devices.</p><p>No matter what the reason is, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. This isn't a "redemption story" for eSIM, but instead just further proves that it's not as perfect a solution as we'd be led to believe. It's not like I was trying to activate an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/poll-responses-too-soon-for-esim-only-phones">eSIM</a> on the first phone to include support for the technology; it's a phone that not only costs an arm and a leg, but is also not even a year old yet.</p><p>While we regularly see many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> follow in Apple's footsteps, this is one area that I'm thankful they haven't. And frankly, I hope the day of an eSIM-only Android phone never comes.</p>

Still, several leaks have been dropping like hotcakes about the company's next set of foldables, a possible tri-fold, or even the new Galaxy Watch. We thought it would be a good idea to provide some clarity amidst the chaos of leaks, so we're going to give you a concise preview of what to expect.</p><p>This year, Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Galaxy Z Fold 7. When it comes to wearables, we also expect to see the new Galaxy Watch 8 along with its twin, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>We're hoping that Samsung will finally give its XR headset a name and launch it to the masses this summer, and there have been some murmurs about Samsung's first multi-fold phone.</p><p>On the software front, we heard an interesting rumor that suggested the Korean OEM is working on releasing One UI 8 in line with Google's Android 16.</p>

<p>While a lucky few get to attend Samsung's Unpacked events in person and watch the magic 'unfold,' the rest of us have to make do with a live stream of the launch on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_3571213889837284912&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">official website</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">YouTube platforms</a>. Samsung has yet to confirm which part of the world the event will take place in this year, and we will update this article with all the information once the Korean OEM announces it.</p><p>So, what can we expect from the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event, and will Samsung's new offerings level up this year?

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 could finally bring a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">creaseless foldable</a>, beating its predecessors. Samsung showed off an unnamed phone next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> at the MWC this year, which got us speculating that this could be the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>The phone is reportedly the slimmest we've seen yet, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">official renders suggest</a> that the Z Fold 7 will feature larger inner and outer displays, with a 6.5-inch cover screen and an 8.2-inch main screen. Backing these rumors is another avid tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_">@TheGalox_</a> who also spilled the entire specs of the device in a recent leak.</p><p>According to them, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-could-actually-be-the-upgrade-weve-been-waiting-for">Z Fold 7</a> may be 4.5mm thin when unfolded, could sport an all-new 200MP camera in lieu of a 50MP sensor we've seen for three generations now, and is rumored to run One UI 8 out of the box.</p>

<p>As for what powers the device, it is rumored to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> with a 4,400 mAh battery. The tipster believes that the new Z Fold 7 will get upgraded durability, a new under-display selfie camera, and "new display layers" that protect the screen.</p><p>That said, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/looks-like-the-galaxy-z-fold-7s-fan-favorite-feature-is-here-to-stay">rumor</a> surfaced that Samsung was "working on a revamped S Pen packed with more features," while it's also "said to be a bit thicker." Hinting that the new Z Fold 7 could be compatible with a stylus — what could be better than a screenless screen and a stylus?</p><p>This could set this device apart from the rest of the foldables. All in all, we think this year's fold will be much more slimmer and advanced than its predecessor. As for how much it would cost, we have little to no information about it. Presumably could be on the boat as the Z Fold 6, which starts at $ 1900.</p>

<p>Samsung's next clamshell could also see some shifts in the way it looks. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-galaxy-z-flip-7-case-leak-backs-larger-cover-display-rumor">Several leaks</a> have indicated that it will be ditching its usual folder-like cover display for a larger 4-inch end-to-end display, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-just-crashed-well-below-its-black-friday-price-but-theres-a-catch">Motorola Razr 2024. </a></p><p>Additional specs of the device have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-rendering-changes-specs-leaked">leaked,</a> indicating that an in-house <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency" target="_blank">Exynos 2500 chipset may power the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency"> </a>to improve the efficiency of the device, although others have suggested it could be the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>As for the cameras, it looks like the device may stick to the same setup of a 50MP primary lens along with a 12MP ultrawide lens. The internal screen may also be slightly bigger when compared to its predecessor, measuring 6.8 inches.  The clamshell is said to be priced at around $1,099, much like its predecessor, and would come with both 256 and 512 storage options.</p>

<p>We've heard some chatter about another clamshell that could show up at the Summer Unpacked — the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE (Fan Edition). Recently, renders of the device showed up online, looking a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>The rumor suggests that the phone will feature a 3.4-inch cover display, accompanied by a 50MP lens and a 12MP camera, and will have an "Aluminum Armor" frame. When flipped open, the device will allegedly have a 6.7-inch display. However, the images suggest that the device will have thicker bezels than the Z Flip 6.</p><p>Some rumors indicate that this device will be powered by Exynos 2500, while others <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">claim the Exynos 2400e</a> in order to keep costs down.</p>

<p>Samsung could be working on One UI 8 behind closed doors, as several rumors claim that it will release this OS in tandem with Google's Android 16.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">first mention</a> of the One UI 8 was by prominent tipster Ice Universe, who posted on X earlier in March. They claimed that the OS could be rolled out much sooner than we expected, considering the delayed rollout of One UI 7.</p><p>The second time we heard about the OS being in development was when leaker Tarun Vats took to X to post a screenshot of the build version of One UI 8 — <em>S938BXXU1BYC1/S938BOXM1BYC1/S938BXXU1BYC1</em> — on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series. He also claimed that Samsung could launch the OS two months earlier than it usually does, by skipping the One UI 7.1 and 7.1.1 updates.</p><p>And if that wasn't enough, more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">evidence</a> has emerged that suggests Samsung may already be testing One UI 8 on the Samsung S25 series. A Geekbench screenshot shared by Tarun Vats again shows the Galaxy S25 (SM-S931B) running a One UI 8 build based on Android 16.</p>

<p>However, Samsung also had something to say when several rumors about One UI 8 kept cropping up. In response to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_3561205305513043832&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.community.samsung.com%2Ft5%2FQuestions%2FOne-Ui-8-Beta%2Fm-p%2F3167416%23M35&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-beta-team-highlights-one-ui-8-testing-rumors" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">community post</a>, a One UI Beta team member states there's nothing official about One UI 8 for stable users or testers.</p><p>They state that while rumors have brought awareness to "certain devices" with One UI 8, "these are likely internal Samsung test units." They add that these devices are typically "used for early-stage development and are not available for public use."</p><p>So we have our hopes up and our fingers crossed that Samsung may likely show us a little sneak peek into the world of their new OS.</p>

<p>We haven't seen many Galaxy Watch 8 rumors yet, but we did spot some early signs that the smartwatch could be in the works. A leak spilled beans that the next-gen watches may have quietly passed safety checks.</p><p>Two batteries with the codenames <em>EB-BL330ABY and EB-BL505ABY</em> are likely meant for the next Galaxy Watch 8 series and have allegedly received the SafetyKorea certification. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-batteries-safetykorea-certification/" target="_blank">XpertPick</a>, the next generation of the Galaxy Watch may come as a duo: the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>Regarding the battery capacity, a TUV certification has revealed that the EB-BL330ABY model will feature a substantial 435mAh battery. To put things into perspective, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 </a>40mm model features a 300 mAh battery while the 44mm one has a 425 mAh battery.</p><p>We also hope that this year's watch could bring all the features that didn't make the cut on the Galaxy Watch 7 series, like the rumored blood-glucose monitoring that Samsung claimed to be developing "as early as the second half of 2024."</p><p>While we wait, here's what we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">wish to see</a> from the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> XR Headset has been the talk of the town lately after it was unveiled at Unpacked in January and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-to-give-us-a-closer-look-at-android-xr-headset">showcased more vividly</a> at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC 2025</a> in Barcelona. We have seen Samsung openly talk about the headset, without giving away too much of its specs, but it's possible we could get a full launch at the summer Unpacked.</p><p>When it comes to design, the headset looks pretty sleek, or as AC's Michael Hicks says, "It looks a lot like the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest Pro had a baby." It has a rigid strap similar to the Meta Quest Pro that can be adjusted with a dial on the back.</p><p>Within the headset is a pair of pancake lenses that provide exceptional clarity for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">4K Micro-OLED screen</a> panels Samsung is using. Each lens has eye tracking around for hands-free interaction in the XR space.</p>

<p>What powers this futuristic headset, you ask? Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</a> will be at the core of this headset that will run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR</a>, a new version of Android that Google says is "the first Android platform built entirely for the Gemini era."</p><p>When the company first teased the headset, it also confirmed that it would come with full support for hand tracking and eye tracking, as well as motion-based controllers. And thanks to a leak from SamMobile, it seems that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/first-party-samsung-controllers-for-its-project-moohan-xr-headset-may-have-been-spotted">first-party controllers </a>for the headset are in the works. But if true, it's hard to tell if the company will ship them with the headset or sell them separately.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung's XR headset could be priced at around $1,500 or less, as it was hinted that it would be cheaper than the Apple Vision Pro. Since we have almost all the specs in place, we're hoping that Samsung will finally launch the XR headset this summer after teasing it for months on end.</p>

<p>Samsung has time and again dropped hints that it is working on a tri-fold device. Be it during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">January Unpacked</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC</a> this year.</p><p>A Korean news website recently stated that Samsung Electronics is reportedly working on bringing the "Galaxy G Fold," along with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, later this year.</p><p>However, we don't really know much about the specs, just that the phone will feature a "newly developed display and film." Other alleged specifications are that the device's main internal display will be around 9.96 inches, and the external display will be 6.49 inches, which is slightly larger than the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally" target="_blank">Huawei</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally"> Mate XT.</a></p><p>Another important detail that emerged from this leak is that this phone may not come with an S Pen. This is likely due to the absence of a digitizer, a magnetic field that enables a pen-like accessory to interact with the screen.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-device-production-details-rumored" target="_blank">rumor surfaced in January</a> that stated the phone could have a "G-shaped fold style" with an inward folding mechanism. This could mean that the phone would fold the screen inward twice, which could be based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/29253/" target="_blank">Flex G screen prototype</a> that surfaced at CES in 2022.</p><p>Additionally, since this would be the company's first multi-fold phone, there appears to be speculation that it will initially produce around 200,000 units to gauge the public's reception of this phone.</p><p>“As this is a form factor that is being introduced [by Samsung] for the first time, only a small quantity will be produced in some countries, just like when the Fold SE was released last year,” an industry insider told ETNews.</p>

<p>Samsung has always surprised us with something at the end of Unpacked, be it a quick tease of the Galaxy Ring or the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. So we're hoping to see some tech drop at this year's summer Unpacked as well.</p><p><strong>Ballie, the AI companion robot </strong></p><p>After five years of hinting at its existence, Samsung could finally be launching its AI robot this summer, which could be the July Unpacked.</p><p>Ballie is a Gemini-powered multimodal robot that can help users with fashion, health, and wellness while also handling home tasks like adjusting lights, setting reminders, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hGxL9HRRceBit4bv76dS6" name="samsung-ballie-floor-hero" alt="Samsung's Ballie AI robot sitting on the floor as its user talks to it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hGxL9HRRceBit4bv76dS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, if you ask the robot "Hey Ballie, how do I look?" The AI robot will "look" at you through its camera before offering a set of "styling recommendations," which could include accessories or an entirely new set of clothes to pick from.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/projectors/home-robot-ballie/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom" target="_blank">Ballie</a> will also be able to engage in natural conversation to help users manage homes, including adjusting lighting, greeting people at the door, personalizing schedules, setting reminders, and more.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Galaxy Ring 2</strong></p><p>While we don't know if Samsung will show off its next smart ring at the summer Unpacked, some rumors hint at this possibility.</p><p>A DigiTimes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">report</a> claims the Galaxy Ring 2 will have "more accurate health data sensors and improved AI functionalities." It also claims the battery life will "exceed seven days," or the approximate capacity of the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a>. According to another tipster, the ring is expected to be "thinner" than the 2.6mm first-gen model, with "longer battery life."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cuY6haPJuzfi4AAY4D9DGK" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-unpacked-2025" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cuY6haPJuzfi4AAY4D9DGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/next-galaxy-ring-could-come-with-sensors-to-measure-body-and-surface-temperatures">also heard some chatter </a>about the ring having new sensors that measure not just the surface but also the skin temperature of the user, as well as other surfaces. These sensors are said to be placed on the side that comes in contact with the user's skin, just like the ones on the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p><p>The company also filed a separate<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-patent-future-galaxy-ring-control-devices/" target="_blank"> patent</a> in February, which demonstrates the rings' ability to control other devices, functioning as a cursor to move objects around on a screen that resembles a laptop or tablet.</p><p>While all of this seems great to have in a smart ring, only time will tell if the company will tease the ring this summer.</p>
<p><strong>Galaxy Buds Pro 4</strong></p><p>Lastly, if you're wondering whether Samsung will launch the<strong> Buds Pro 4</strong> this year, then it is highly unlikely since the company launches one every two years and we will probably see one launch in 2026. That said, Samsung never misses a chance to surprise us, so you never know.</p>

It's also our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet#section-best-for-work-and-play">best Amazon tablet for work and play</a>, largely because its performance and display are a couple of steps ahead of the retailer's lower-end offerings.</p><p>We like the Fire Max 11 for its 11-inch screen, and the fact that Amazon says you can get up to 14 hours of battery life. It also offers easy access to Alexa voice commands for those who want to integrate the device into their Google-based smart home setup.</p><p>As for some of the downsides, the display only features a 60Hz refresh rate, and it also has just 4GB of RAM. Those who don't like Amazon's devices may also prefer going with a different brand, though its certainly worth thinking about at this price point.</p>

<ul><li>Startup company Perplexity AI is reportedly engaging in talks with Motorola and Samsung to have its software preloaded or available as a "default" assistant option.</li><li>A deal has supposedly been met with Motorola to have its AI pre-loaded onto devices as a secondary option besides Gemini.</li><li>Samsung's talks are reportedly still early; however, if it works, the brand could bring Perplexity's app to consumers or have its AI as a "default" option.</li><li>Samsung and Motorola are no strangers to custom on-device AI as both have crafted Galaxy AI and Moto AI, respectively.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reports claim a couple of well-known smartphone brands could seek an AI startup company's software for future devices.</p><p>The report stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-16/perplexity-in-talks-to-integrate-assistant-into-samsung-motorola-phones">Bloomberg,</a> which cites people "close to the matter" by saying Perplexity AI is seeking arrangements with notable OEMs. Supposedly, the company is looking to go toe-to-toe with the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google's Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-android-app-launch">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a> as a potential on-device AI assistant. Sources claim Perplexity AI has reached out to Samsung and Motorola about the possibility of being loaded onto phones as a "default" option.</p><p>Interestingly, the report claims Perplexity AI has already agreed upon a deal with Motorola's parent company, Lenovo, for assistant integration.</p><p>This agreement will allegedly have Perplexity's software "pre-loaded" onto Motorola's phones as a secondary option besides Gemini. Not only will future Motorola consumers see a marketing push by the brand to try out Perplexity, but a "tailored" version will be available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">its Razr foldable</a>.</p><p>Sources add Samsung's talks are still early. This is apparently partly due to Samsung's close relations with Google and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">haul of AI features</a>. However, if things go well, Samsung could feature Perplexity's AI as an assistant option or pre-load its app for users.</p>
<h2 id="venturing-into-ai-2">Venturing into AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4141px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ktKHfzbBrzuKuhUF9mPQSE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-15.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ktKHfzbBrzuKuhUF9mPQSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4141" height="2329" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, Samsung reportedly has dealings with Perplexity after investing in the startup in 2024. For context, Perplexity AI was founded in 2022, and Samsung is supposedly thinking of investing another sum of money into the company in 2025, per Bloomberg. With that, it seems talks <em>might </em>go favorably for Perplexity, but these things are usually complicated, so there's no telling until it happens.</p><p>Samsung has continued its push for an "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Phone</a>" via its Galaxy series for quite some time, introducing Galaxy AI and more to consumers. When the Galaxy S25 launched in January, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">quickly expanded</a> AI Overviews in Circle to Search for the newest flagship trio. The generative AI-based feature now surfaces additional information for visual search queries.</p><p>Galaxy users also have a heavy dose of Gemini through on-device means for assistance whenever needed.</p><p>On the other hand, you have Motorola, which brought its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/moto-ai-open-beta-program">Moto AI</a>" suite of features to beta testers late last year. It was only available for select phones, but Moto AI included tools for notification summaries, recall capabilities, and "enhanced" recording with transcriptions available. The company remains confident in its software, stating feedback will "help shape Moto experiences, ensuring that what’s developed meets consumer wants and needs."</p>

<hr>
<p>It seems a U.S. federal judge has finally delivered their ruling regarding the antitrust case against Google's alleged monopolization of ad space.</p><p>Leonie Brinkema, a US District Judge, reportedly declared Thursday (Apr. 17) that Alphabet, the parent company of Google, violated antitrust laws for advertisements. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/google-partially-loses-us-advertising-tech-antitrust-case">Bloomberg</a> brought the ruling to light, adding this violation concerns "advertising exchanges and tools used by websites to sell ad space."</p><p>However, for the other side of this case, which focuses on buying display ads, Brinkema reportedly states Google "didn't meet the definition" of a monopoly.</p><p>Ads are a key aspect of Google's business and its practices with it, which is why the US government has looked into its "monopoly power." To that end, Brinkema stated Thursday that Google "willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets."</p><p>The judge says Google has only bolstered its monopoly power within the ad space by "depriving rivals of the ability to compete." Brinkema states that not only did this obscure potentially "desirable" products from its publishers, but it also violated the competitive process.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google defended itself by saying, "Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable, and effective."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZQy35xwU77WcDvb9Gkc6AF" name="google-logo-nyc-plants.jpg" alt="A photo of the Google Logo surrounded by plants at the company's NYC headquarters building" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZQy35xwU77WcDvb9Gkc6AF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This case isn't done yet. Judge Leonie Brinkema's involvement was to determine if this ad monopoly case had merit. Since part of it reportedly does, Brinkema has informed the parties involved that they will seek a remedy by "separating the court proceedings."</p><p>This determination of merit started last year in November when the DOJ (Department of Justice) said Google is "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-once-twice-three-times-a-monopolist-says-the-justice-department">once, twice, three times a monopolist</a>." During the closing arguments of the antitrust case regarding Google's ad-tech business, U.S. lawyers claimed the company was running a monopoly due to its acquisition of Doubleclick, an advertising company. Again, Google stood with its practices, stating the DOJ proved "the exact opposite" of its accusations.</p><p>Google's defense argues that its "conduct is a story of innovation in response to competition" and a prime catalyst behind its $31 billion in revenue in 2023, thanks to a healthy market.</p><p>Alongside this ad-tech space monopoly case was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">search monopoly court case</a>. The DOJ has pushed Google to sell Chrome after a judge found the company guilty of running an illegal search monopoly. The judge is also urging Google to separate Android from Search and Play and rework its data licensing.</p><p>Bloomberg adds that a new trial will begin Monday (Apr. 21) to determine a remedy for this situation.</p>

<p>We see a wave of new tech gadgets every year, sometimes revolutionary but most times just evolutionary. Samsung has gotten into the latter rhythm over the past few years with incremental updates for its most popular tech products, like phones and wearables. This year, we'll most likely be seeing the Galaxy Watch 8 launch, maybe around July, like in 2024. The Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 7 question is a valid one, as Samsung has made significant changes to the Watch 7. So, what's in store for the Watch 8?</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 will no doubt be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung smartwatches of 2025</a>, but if you're a Watch 7 owner, should you consider upgrading? As of writing this, Samsung hasn't officially announced the Watch 8, so we're essentially comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">rumored specs and features</a> to the Watch 7.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7-design-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 7: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ubr3aUgtSFHaXthdqnK6fZ" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-app-drawer.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's app drawer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ubr3aUgtSFHaXthdqnK6fZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We don't have any leaked images of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 just yet, so we're going to assume it won't look all that different than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. Early rumors suggested that Samsung might adopt a squircle design, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, but we believe it will stick to its circular design. There could be a few design tweaks, changes to textures, and new colors, but it should look more or less the same.</p><p>In terms of variants, the Galaxy Watch 8 should come in two sizes of 40mm and 44mm, each having Wi-Fi and LTE options. The screen sizes should also be 1.3 and 1.5 inches, just like the Watch 7. The Watch 8 could get a brighter AMOLED display, as this is one spec that's easy to tweak going into a new generation.</p><p>One way of differentiating the Galaxy Watch 8 from the Watch 7 would be through colors. We'll most certainly have a few exclusive shades for the casing and straps. The mounting bracket should be backward compatible with the Watch 7, so you'll be able to reuse older straps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> comes in a 40mm model with a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display and a 44mm model with a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED display. Samsung has gone with Sapphire Crystal for scratch protection, which is the same material we should expect on the Watch 8, too.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7's display has a peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits, which is the same as that on the older Watch 6. In daily use, we found the screen to be crisp and highly legible even under direct sunlight. The Galaxy Watch 7 comes with a sports band that matches the color of the watch's casing. You can mix and match the strap type and colors via Samsung.com, though.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7-specs-and-hardware-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 7: Specs and hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="WQbshdpZ6mYeN6wdpY8bQg" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-3d-watch-face.jpg" alt="3D watch face on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQbshdpZ6mYeN6wdpY8bQg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're expecting the Galaxy Watch 8 to come in at the same price as the Watch 7, which is $299.99 for the 40mm model with Wi-Fi. The 44mm model should start at $329.99, and add another $50 for the LTE variants. There is no evidence yet to suggest that prices will increase, even with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">heavy tariffs</a> being imposed by the U.S. on other countries.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7 came with a newer Exynos W1000 chip, and we expect Samsung to stick with the same one this year. It's not uncommon for the company to reuse its processors across generations. Having said that, the Watch 8 could always make the switch and debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025" target="_blank">Qualcomm's second-generation Snapdragon W5</a> chip, which is said to be better at handling advanced AI functionality. Perhaps this is one way Samsung gets Gemini to run on its watches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3674px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="vuxNbiHMbhfntEpiiysHQY" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-health-sensor-button-color.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's curvy new sensor array and orange home button accent" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vuxNbiHMbhfntEpiiysHQY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3674" height="2067" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the rest of the specs, we expect it to be similar to the Watch 7. The Galaxy Watch 8 should come with 2GB of RAM, at least 32GB of storage, dual-band GPS, IP68 dust and water resistance, and a MIL-STD-810H rating for toughness.</p><p>It should also have the same rejigged BioActive sensor that debuted with the Watch 7 for advanced health monitoring like the AGEs Index. We could see some new health metric tracking with the Watch 8, to give it some exclusivity. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">Blood glucose and diabetes</a> monitoring are two things Samsung is working on, which could launch with the Watch 8.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is expected to have a similar battery life to the Watch 7. For now, we only have reports claiming that the 44mm model will have a 435mAh battery, which is just 10mAh more than the Watch 7. Samsung estimates a 40-hour runtime for the Watch 7, which is expected to carry over to the Watch 8 as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EXSqv7G3dQMgMTm5UvZZUj" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-band-collection-169" alt="Galaxy Watch 7 bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EXSqv7G3dQMgMTm5UvZZUj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 has 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, an IP68 rating, and MIL-STD-810H certification. The new addition is Samsung's improved BioActive Sensor, which is capable of more accurate health and fitness tracking thanks to the redesign of the LED sensors. The glass dome underneath the watch is also more pronounced, so it makes better skin contact.</p><p>The downside to this design is that the Watch 7 loses its ability to be charged wirelessly on the back of a Samsung phone with reverse wireless charging capability. The charging puck has also been specially redesigned, which means the Watch 7 won't fast-charge effectively on older Galaxy Watch chargers.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 has a 300mAh or 425mAh battery capacity and supports  WPC-based fast charging. In our review, the 44mm variant lasted two days with the AOD (always-on display) disabled, which we think is pretty decent.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7-features-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 7: Features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="9UNAC8Hicc5fbuv4o2dZTb" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-media-playback-youtube-music.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's media playback controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UNAC8Hicc5fbuv4o2dZTb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Samsung follows the same launch timeline as 2024 for the Galaxy Watch 8, it could be one of the first smartwatches to launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>. This would also mean we get a new One UI 7 Watch version with similar design themes to the One UI 7 on Samsung's phones.</p><p>We don't know what new features will be added, but we should get a pretty good idea by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-date-official">Google I/O 2025</a>, where many of the new features will likely be demoed. Google announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Google Assistant will finally be replaced by Gemini</a> on watches too, although it's unclear what nano version of Gemini can run on just 2GB of RAM.</p><p>One thing's for sure: Samsung will add some sort of exclusive health and fitness tracking features that are not available on the Watch 7. These features could eventually come to it through a software update, but Samsung will want some exclusivity for the Watch 8 for at least the first few months in order to drive sales.</p><p>The Watch 7 was already great at sleep tracking and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-excited-about-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-health-feature">sleep apnea monitoring</a>, so it'll be interesting to see how these features are improved in the new model.</p>

<p>With the Galaxy Watch 8 launch still some time away, it's hard to say that it will offer better value than the Galaxy Watch 7 just yet. All leaks and rumors so far point towards it being an incremental upgrade, which is to say, it will have a few new things, but nothing that would warrant trading in the Watch 7 for. If Samsung keeps the same pricing, it could very well be the best Samsung watch to buy in 2025 (provided you don't already have the Watch 7).</p><p>If you don't want to wait till July, I think you can confidently pick up the Galaxy Watch 7 today at a discounted price and be happy with it for the next few years. It doesn't have any deal-breaking problems, should get good software support for the next few years, and it best complements your Samsung phone. The minimalist design is something I personally love, as you can adapt it to any attire with the right watch strap.</p>

With the newer Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, we're holding out a much more significant upgrade.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will probably have a newer processor and a better cover screen, but we're also hearing talk about a possible Z Flip FE launching alongside it. Allegedly, this might be a cheaper version of the Flip 7.</p><p>If you are looking to upgrade your Z Flip or are just curious about the upcoming small-form foldable phone from Samsung, here's a comparison of the two devices based on all the information we can glean from current rumors, leaks, and speculations.</p>

<p>All the leaks suggest that the Z Flip 7 will feature much slimmer bezels and larger displays, both internally and externally. The outer cover screen is expected to be significantly larger, expanding from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6" target="_blank">Flip 6</a>'s 3.4-inch AMOLED display to a 4-inch AMOLED screen. Additionally, we can also look forward to the screen refresh getting a significant boost, increasing from 60Hz to a buttery smooth 120Hz.</p><p>The internal screen is expected to be upgraded as well, increasing in size over the last generation. Apparently, it will measure 6.85 inches in size, instead of the older 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X LTPO display.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-leak">Rumors suggest</a> a softer, curvier design for the next-gen Z Flip 7, featuring more rounded edges rather than the sharp, square aesthetic of the Z Flip 6.</p><p>There's also been some excitement concerning the crease itself. Samsung debuted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">creaseless panel at MWC </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">2025</a>, which is likely to be utilized in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 series. Another display upgrade we're betting on is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-pholed-display-2025-potential">addition of a blue phosphorescent material</a> to the OLED panel to increase its efficiency and cut down on energy consumption for an improved battery life.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 finally bumped the primary camera of Samsung's more stylish foldable lineup. While we do wish to see cameras as powerful as the S25 Ultra or the S25 Plus on the Flip 7, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-alleged-galaxy-z-flip-7-camera-specs-detailed">likely not going to happen</a>. That said, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 produces very respectable images with impressive zoom quality and color reproduction. It's not the best, but it definitely gets the job done.</p><p>Therefore, we're expecting to see identical cameras on the Flip 7, with the primary sensors being 50MP wide and 12MP ultrawide cameras. Some whispers on the interweb suggest a front camera upgrade, but we'll have to wait until the expected summer 2025 launch to know for sure.</p>

<p>Performance is expected to be the highlight of the Z Flip 7, as we anticipate seeing 12GB of RAM paired with the top-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</a> for the Galaxy Z Flip 7. This is the same chipset from the flagship Galaxy S25 trio, so the results should be impressive.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is currently the fastest mobile SoC in the world, so it's no joke that the tiny Flip 7 will be powered by one.</p><p>We're also expecting to see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-could-give-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-a-battery-boost">battery boost on the Flip 7</a>, which will feature a 4,300mAh battery, replacing the Flip 6's 4,000mAh cell. This, paired with the more efficient display and processor, should result in a markedly improved uptime compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>Lastly, we can expect to receive Android 15 with One UI 7 on the Flip 7, along with Samsung's seven-year commitment to platform and security updates. That said, there has been speculation that Samsung will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">debut One UI 8</a>, based on Android 16, with its upcoming foldables, which could give Samsung a head start over much of the competition.</p><p>Naturally, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> goodies featured on the S25 series will likely make their way to the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7 as well.</p>

<p>Since the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 isn't out yet, we can't say decisively whether it's better or worse than the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>Based on leaks and trends, it's safe to assume that the Flip 7 will cost more or less the same as the Flip 6 at launch. It's definitely going to boast upgraded hardware, but we're not yet sure whether the upgrades will be good enough to warrant an upgrade.</p><p>If you're not a Flip 6 owner, though, getting the latest version of Android out of the box, along with tons of fun AI features and the promise of seven years of OS and security updates, is reason enough to buy the Flip 7 once it's available.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus is seemingly preparing another Android tablet launch, but its specifics are all speculative.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=Y&application_id=8QSd69tmvBJKN7cKPFOhsw%3D%3D&fcc_id=2ABZ2-OPD2408">FCC listing</a> was discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-pad-flagship-tablet-coming-soo-us_id169547">PhoneArena</a>, which seemingly hints at the next Pad tablet from the Chinese OEM. The certification is rather light; however, it clues us into the potential name of the tablet. According to the provided files, the company may look to call the tablet the "OnePlus Pad 3R" whenever it launches in the U.S.</p><p>However, the publication reiterates that a previous leak cited the tablet as the "OnePlus Pad 2 Pro." While it seems the FCC listed name <em>could be </em>more accurate, we'll have to see when OnePlus teases it officially.</p><p>The FCC listing didn't offer concrete details about the tablet's supposed specs aside from its Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC capabilities. Rumors about its specifications arrive via speculation that OnePlus' next tablet could mirror OPPO. If this happens, rumors claim OnePlus could mirror the OPPO Pad 4 Pro with a 13.2-inch display, a 13MP primary lens, and an 8MP selfie camera.</p><p>OnePlus could also pack a 12,140mAh battery into the device with 67W wired fast charging. Ramping up its strength is rumored to be Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p>

<p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/new_oneplus_tablet_gets_certified_by_the_fcc_could_be_the_pad_3_pro-news-67441.php">GSMArena</a> draws attention to OPPO's Pad 4 Pro launch in China, which only happened a week ago. The tablet was originally introduced to consumers last year in December, preparing them for its eventual 2025 market debut. Accompanying that device in December was the launch of the OnePlus Pad 3; however, it notes that the device features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oppo-unveils-the-first-android-tablet-with-mediateks-dimensity-8350-chipset">MediaTek Dimensity 8350</a> SoC.</p><p>The chip was also featured in the OPPO Pad 3, which was designed to be more budget-friendly. Considering the rumors, it seems OnePlus might look to return to more flagship-level specs and power with its next release, like OPPO.</p><p>OnePlus' tablets have consistently leaned toward power, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-pro-launched-in-china">the Pad Pro</a> featured the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. That same SoC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-costs-more-but-its-upgrades-make-it-worth-the-price">rolled into the Pad 2</a>, but despite it not being a Pro model, OnePlus truly dug deep with its upgrades, which also raised its price to $550 (from $479) when it rolled into the U.S. There are concerns that the tariffs introduced by President Trump could impact pricing even more, but time will tell.</p>

There are more options, a wide variety of form factors, and no matter what your budget is, there's a phone for you.</p><p>However, those reasons don't seem to translate when it comes to market share in the U.S., as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america" target="_blank">StatCounter</a> has iOS holding more than 57% of the market share, with Android coming in at just north of 42%. This is a stark contrast when you pull back and look at the global market, as more than 70% of the world runs on Android.</p>

<p>With those kinds of numbers, even on a global scale, you might think that we'd see more apps arrive on Android first, if not at the same time as iOS. Unfortunately, that's not the case, as we still see iOS get the first crack when many new apps hit the scene, only to come to Android later, if at all.</p><p>Such is the case with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notion.com/product/mail">Notion Mail</a>, an app that I've been extremely excited about since I learned it was in development. After years of being able to stay on top of my various inboxes, I've practically given up, resigning myself to seeing more than 5,000 unread emails across multiple accounts. My hope was that Notion Mail would offer some type of help in this struggle, mainly because of how much I already enjoy using Notion, and frankly, the app represents a breath of fresh air.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2548px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.10%;"><img id="VsUPPuuUfriPR8FEPdCPjR" name="notion-mail-hero-banner" alt="Notion Mail announcement banner hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VsUPPuuUfriPR8FEPdCPjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2548" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Notion)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Much to my dismay, the app is currently only available in your browser and on the Mac, with the iOS version "coming soon." So what about Android? According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notion.com/product/mail#:~:text=When%20will%20Notion%20Mail%20be%20available%20on%20mobile%20devices%3F">Q&A section</a> on the official landing page, it's coming "in 2025." For some odd reason, I never even thought that Notion Mail would be platform-limited on release. Especially given that both Notion and Notion Calendar can be downloaded on practically anything.</p><p>So, why is Notion targeting iOS and macOS first, before Android or Windows? Well, the Windows answer is actually pretty easy, as you can just log in via the web and use a web app. I might be off base, on the Mac, the Notion Mail app seems like it's nothing more than a wrapper for the web app, which isn't all that surprising.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M6ZEcVZe37cXuNYYMzQ75i" name="notion-mail-iphone-mockup-render" alt="Notion Mail mockup on the iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6ZEcVZe37cXuNYYMzQ75i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1016" height="572" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Notion)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what about Android? Over the years, we've seen and heard complaints from developers that iOS is just an easier platform to develop for. However, I was also under the assumption that Google had been making strides to close the gap for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/reported-changes-to-android-development-arent-really-a-change">Android developers</a>.</p><p>After discussing this topic idea with a few colleagues, I was immediately reminded of the real reason. The same thing that makes Android so appealing to the masses is the very thing that holds it back from being the primary focus for developers. There are simply too many devices that need to be tested and accounted for, not to mention the various form factors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="85kFgjerPQG8dD7qqwC4ZJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="Android Central's best of 2024 phone and accessories selection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/85kFgjerPQG8dD7qqwC4ZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To put this in perspective, Apple's current lineup of phones consists of seven different models. That includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-plus-vs-iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-max">iPhone 15 and 15 Plus</a>, which were released in 2023. Throw in the entire current crop of iPads, and we're up to a total of 13 devices, across three different screen sizes.</p><p>In comparison, Google offers a total of eight devices, ranging from the 6.1-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and maxing out with the 11-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet/i-dont-want-the-pixel-tablet-to-die">Pixel Tablet</a>, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> mixed in. Samsung blows them both away with a combination of more than 20 phones and tablets that are readily available for purchase from the company's website. Between Samsung and Google alone, there are more than 30 devices to account for, with screen sizes ranging from 6.1 inches to 14.6 inches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nuw4Jq35aqgLoA6B4jZxR8" name="samsung-ecosystem-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Samsung ecosystem of devices including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Buds 3 Pro, Samsung laptop, and Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nuw4Jq35aqgLoA6B4jZxR8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On top of that, you have to take into account the various Android versions that are in the wild. Obviously, the varying versions of Android play a big role, as new APIs and features are introduced (and removed) with each release. But, I'm not just talking about an app being able to support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> and above, as we also have the various OEM "skins" that factor into the equation with their own set of APIs.</p><p>So, is there anything that can actually be done? I'm not a developer by any means, but I don't really think so. I mean, it's 2025, and this is still something that happens on a regular-enough cadence to be an annoyance. Unfortunately, this is just the way the cookie crumbles, so I'll just have to continue staring out the window like a sad puppy waiting for Notion Mail to hit the Play Store. Or at least for something else to come along and distract me for a while.</p>

<ul><li>Google Chrome 135 on Android introduces a long-requested bottom address bar feature this week.</li><li>The said feature had been available for iOS users since 2023, and other browsers like Samsung Internet have also had this feature for a while.</li><li>The latest feature update has been popping up for Chrome on Android this week, and a wider roll out is expected soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Chrome users will now have an easy way to browse, especially for large-screen phones. The search giant has started rolling out a new update, which shifts the address bar from its conventional top position to the bottom.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/15/chrome-bottom-address-bar-android-135/">9to5Google</a>, Google has initially tested the bottom address bar on its Chrome app for Android last October, and the company is now rolling it out to the stable version of the browser app on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones.</a></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="7HeVbnB2JkXAWxyoVXS6u7" name="chrome-135-android-bottom-address-bar" alt="Chrome 135 bottom address bar option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HeVbnB2JkXAWxyoVXS6u7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication further notes that some users on the stable build, which is the Chrome 135 version, are already seeing the new prompt "You can touch and hold to move the address bar to the bottom.” Alternatively, Chrome settings also has a new section dubbed "Address bar" that allows users to change its placement to top or bottom, per their preference.</p><p>Further, aside from the positioning, nothing significantly has changed with the new address bar. The three-dot menu and its options like new tab, incognito tab, bookmarks, and history remain the same, and users would still have to reach for the top of the screen to get them, while having them reordered to the bottom would have been ideal as they are the most used options while browsing.</p>

<p>The said feature appears to have just started popping up on the Chrome 135 version this week, and the wider roll-out of the feature is expected soon. It has been a widely requested feature as the phones today have become hard to reach to the top, especially when using with a single hand.</p><p>Such handy options are already available in browsers like Samsung Internet and Arc browser. It is good to see Google catch up and bring the most requested feature finally to Android devices, whereas iOS users have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-ios-move-address-bar-bottom">had this functionality</a> for a while now, since 2023 to be precise.</p>

Maybe even yours.</p><p>To make it even worse, these providers are based in China. To Americans, anything related to China is often viewed as bad, but the fact that there are potentially billions of customers using these services is real. Knowing they've been compromised is terrifying to many network security professionals.</p>
<p>I take any reports from a company that profits from network security with a grain of salt, but after reading the report in full, the claims sound valid on most counts.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-mobile-interconnect-provider-2">What is a mobile interconnect provider?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="og58fKiBAUZCKvQ3UyMqyb" name="verizon-sign-storefront-widecrop.jpg" alt="Verizon store sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/og58fKiBAUZCKvQ3UyMqyb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To understand why this matters, you need to know what is being affected. A mobile interconnect provider is exactly what it sounds like — a thing that allows two or more different mobile networks to communicate with each other.</p><p>Let's say you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> account. You can send and receive anything from another phone using a Verizon account across Verizon's network, as long as both parties are in Verizon's service area.</p><p>If you're talking to someone on AT&T, or Orange or are outside of a normal Verizon service area (maybe you're vacationing) that traffic has to be routed across different networks so it can reach it's destination.</p><p>These interconnect providers use complicated routing and control software to make it happen. Some, such as Chinese state-owned networks China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, CITIC Telecom, and PCCW Global Hong Kong, play a dominant role in routing all this traffic and use software and protocols that are severely outdated and unsafe.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5" name="5g-icon.jpg" alt="5G icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of this is speculation. There are multiple real-world examples of how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.firstpoint-mg.com/blog/ss7-attack-guide/" target="_blank">SS7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_(protocol)" target="_blank">Diameter</a>, the unsafe network signaling protocols in question, have been exploited. A group with the ability to exploit this software can access authentication data, SMS messages, location updates, and internet traffic in either real-time for active threats or store it for passive threats.</p><p>You probably aren't a high-value target, yet your data is potentially being stored so it can one day be used against you.</p><p>The report also states how this makes it trivial for Chinese government-sponsored hacking groups to operate, but there is no proof given; an attacker can be anywhere in the world and gain access. These companies may be controlled by the Chinese state, but they could also be victims in all this. Victims with the means to make a change, though.</p>

<p>The United States stopped considering Chinese interconnect providers as trusted under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4998" target="_blank">Secure Networks Act</a> so US outbound traffic isn't routed through any of the companies in question.

<ul><li>Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are beginning to receive an update, which brings Spotify capabilities, as well as Apple Music and Shazam, to more places.</li><li>The glasses AI grabs more natural, "lifelike" voices while its capabilities for real-world insights expands to the U.K.</li><li>Earlier this year, Meta announced that its Ray-Ban glasses have crossed 2 million units sold, and there are plans to increase its production to 10 million by 2026.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Owners of Meta's smart glasses are in for an end-of-the-week treat as the company rolls in a patch full of additions.</p><p>Update v14.1 for the Ray-Ban Meta glasses was spotted by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich earlier today (Apr. 17). The update focuses on the smart glasses' apps and AI software. To start, Meta states Ray-Ban is picking up the ability to "play music and shuffle by artist, albums, and playlists" via Spotify.</p><p>With this, users are receiving two important voice commands: "shuffle my (X) playlist" and "repeat this song."</p><p>Each of these can be kick-started with "Hey Meta" once the patch is installed. Spotify is available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> for English users in the U.K., Canada, Australia, France, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Norway. Meta is also expanding its "connected apps," such as Apple Music and Shazam in conjunction with Spotify, to the previously listed regions.</p><p>Meta AI on the smart glasses can now interpret queries about weather, air quality, and the UV index via voice commands. The latest v14.1 patch for the Ray-Ban glasses includes a few AI updates, which can be seen below.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Updated Voices: </strong>Meta AI Voices have been updated to sound more natural and lifelike. Users can navigate to <strong>Meta AI Settings > Voice </strong>to select a voice for the software to use.</li><li><strong>Meta AI expands to the U.K.: </strong>Users can learn about the history of landmarks while walking or get recipe suggestions based on the content in their home.</li></ul>

<p>Meta dropped the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">most futuristic AI update</a> for the Ray-Ban smart glasses right before the holidays in December. The patch concerned Early Access program members, as the company delivered Live Record and Live Translate. The former allows the Ray-Ban glasses to record what you see and offer AI-powered insights without users needing to say "Hey Meta" aloud.</p><p>Members could also interrupt the AI or ask a follow-up question after it gives its response. Live Translate is pretty straightforward; users can hear or read the response of a person speaking another language via the glasses' speaker or their phones.</p><p>More importantly, since launching in 2023, Meta's Ray-Ban glasses seem to be a hit after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">having sold 2 million units</a> since then. To celebrate, EssilorLuxottica announced that it's looking to increase mass production of the device to 10 million units by 2026. Additionally, it seems both companies are betting big on these smart glasses. While Meta has already started a huge smart glasses push, even grabbing some top tanked celebrities to showcase it, there are rumors that the next generation will feature a built-in display.</p><p>The display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/looks-like-ray-ban-meta-ar-glasses-are-getting-a-visual-upgrade">might be tiny</a>, but it would alleviate the need for users to reach for their phones or rely solely on the Ray-Ban speaker for info.</p>

At the other end of the scale is the Galaxy A56; Samsung's latest mid-ranger has incremental upgrades, and while it looks a little different to its predecessor, it has the same foibles. In a year of strong options, the Galaxy A56 is the worst mid-range phone on sale today.</p>

<p>Samsung never really offered a strong hardware package with its A series devices, instead positioning these phones as "all-rounders." As such, the Exynos 1580 on the Galaxy A56 is considerably slower than other mid-range phones, and this is immediately evident when you push the hardware — it just doesn't do a good job with gaming, and I noticed some lag after a week of use even with the optimized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>.</p><p>I was holding out for Samsung to make considerable changes in this area. That isn't the case, and the A56 continues to be just as middling as its predecessors — the hardware just isn't good enough for a phone that costs $499. The one positive change is that the panel gets brighter, and it does a good job with HDR content. However, it doesn't get as bright as the Nord 4 or the Phone 3a Pro in daily use.</p>

<p>Another uptick has to do with the visual aesthetic; Samsung tweaked the design at the back, introducing an oblong camera island that looks clean. The phone has a metal mid-frame and glass back, and has a better in-hand feel than some of its predecessors. You also get Samsung Knox, and there's IP67 ingress protection. <br><br>Samsung is doubling down on AI, so the A56 gets Best Face, Instant Slo-mo, and auto-trim features. However, you don't get the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> suite of utilities — you'll need to buy the Galaxy S25 series to unlock the extras. Google did a much better job porting over most of its AI utilities into the Pixel 9a, and if you're ready to dive into AI-assisted features, that's the mid-range phone I recommend.</p>

<p>The Galaxy A56 has the same 5000mAh battery as last year, and counter to every other phone I tested in 2025, the battery doesn't last as long as its predecessor. I still got a day's worth of use at times, but push the device to any extent, and you'll need to plug it in before the night's out. <br><br>Samsung switched to 45W charging, but it still takes the A56 well over 75 minutes to charge the battery, and it is one of the slowest-charging mid-range phones around — only the Pixel 9a takes longer. Samsung doesn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide battery tech</a> either, and that means yet another year where the A56 doesn't quite measure up to its rivals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dChAPA7iQCT9NEVUyPyy3j" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dChAPA7iQCT9NEVUyPyy3j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the cameras; the phone has a good selfie camera, and while there's no autofocus, it does a decent enough job in well-lit scenarios. The main 50MP camera proved to be inconsistent, and the quality of the images I got out of the device just didn't hold up with other mid-rangers. Similarly, the auxiliary cameras just aren't worth the bother, and Samsung really needs to take a page out of Nothing's playbook and focus on delivering two great cameras on its devices. <br><br>I shared these findings with a Samsung India representative, and was told that the brand jotted down the feedback and would get back to me if there's anything to share. Considering my previous interactions with Samsung over the years, I doubt anything would come of it.</p>

<p>Having <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-a7-2016-review-close-no-cigar">tested all Galaxy A series devices</a> going back to the original Galaxy A5, and A7, I'd like to think that I have a decent understanding of Samsung's mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Galaxy A portfolio</a>. In recent years, the brand started to rest on its laurels, basically rehashing the same device with little to no changes. That allowed its Chinese rivals to catch up, and with the Galaxy A56, we're at a point where it doesn't make any sense to buy the device when there are much better alternatives available. <br><br>I know that a big allure with Samsung's phones is the familiar software, but even with One UI 7, the phone just doesn't do enough to justify its $499 asking price. While Samsung didn't have much in the way of rivalry in the U.S., that isn't the case now — the Pixel 9a and OnePlus 13R deliver a better experience in just about every area, and they cost the same as the A56. If you're outside North America, you should consider taking a look at the POCO X7 Pro or the Nord 4 in addition to the aforementioned devices.</p><p>Even if you're a long-term Samsung user, I encourage you to take a look at some of the alternatives before considering the A56. Samsung has proven time and again that it doesn't care about delivering meaningful changes to its mid-range phones, and the A56 does a great job highlighting the brand's deficiencies in 2025.</p>

While the brand doesn't have class-leading hardware, its software suite continues to be the best in the industry, and its NAS servers have been reliable. Currently, I use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">DiskStation DS1823xs+ as my main NAS</a>, housing over 140TB of data, and I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/synology-diskstation-ds1621xs-plus-review">DS1621xs+</a> as a secondary NAS containing over 80TB of data. <br><br>Synology had a quiet 2024, but the brand is gearing up to launch its 2025 portfolio soon. But when the new Plus series models come out, there will be a significant limitation: these DiskStation models will be compatible with Synology's first-party drives, and not the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-long-lasting-hard-drives-nas-synology-qnap">best NAS HDDs</a> from Seagate and Western Digital. <br><br>Synology started enforcing this on its business-centric NAS models back in 2021 — which is incidentally when it introduced its own drives — but it mentioned at the time that the move <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-why-synology-switched-validated-disks-enterprise-nas-enclosures">wouldn't affect the consumer DiskStation series</a>. But at the same time, the brand significantly reduced the number of eligible third-party IronWolf and WD Red models, and now it is entirely walking back earlier claims and limiting its DiskStation Plus series to its own drives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wFfV2S93G9cnKhm4nsqB5Y" name="diskstation-ds1823xs-plus-26.jpg" alt="DiskStation DS1823xs+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wFfV2S93G9cnKhm4nsqB5Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.synology.com/de-de/company/news/article/DACH_VL_plus/Synology%20setzt%20f%C3%BCr%20kommende%20Plus-Modelle%20verst%C3%A4rkt%20auf%20das%20eigene%20%C3%96kosystem">press release</a> (in German): "For users, this means that starting with the Plus series models released in 2025, only Synology’s own hard drives and third-party hard drives certified according to Synology’s specifications will be compatible and offer the full range of functions and support." <br><br>The brand notes that this is only valid with Plus models debuting in 2025 and later, so the existing portfolio consisting of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DS224+</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds723-review">DS723+</a>, and all other models are unaffected. Synology also noted that migrating drives from an existing NAS to a 2025 Plus server won't incur any restrictions: "There will be no changes for Plus models released up to and including 2024 (excluding the XS Plus series and rack models). Furthermore, migrating hard drives from existing Synology NAS to a new Plus model will continue to be possible without restrictions."<br><br>Basically, if you use anything other than a Synology-branded hard drive in the 2025 DiskStation Plus models, you won't be able to use key features like volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic hard drive firmware updates. Synology says it is making this change to "reduce compatibility issues and increase system reliability," but the real reason has to do with money — the brand would rather you buy its own drives instead of Seagate and WD's products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m2KSqM62VcWZvFxWpeE3c" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-6.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2KSqM62VcWZvFxWpeE3c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>In a statement, Synology said that it conducted 7,000 hours of rigorous testing with its own hard drives in conjunction with the upcoming DiskStation Plus models, and that in general it saw a "20% reduction in support tickets related to storage and drive issues when using Synology’s HDDs." <br><br>It is understandable that the brand is trying to provide a tighter integration between its drives and NAS servers, but the choice should ultimately be made by the user. As someone who uses Seagate's IronWolf and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/seagate-exos-x24-24tb-hdd-review">Exos drives</a> extensively alongside Toshiba and WD Red HDDs, I don't want to be shoehorned into selecting just one drive. <br><br>I've always recommended Synology NAS servers for their robust feature-set and ease of use, but this deliberate user-hostile move has me rethinking that decision. I'll await judgement until I get my hands on the Plus models (they're debuting shortly), but as an enthusiast, I can't help but feel that Synology is abandoning its loyal userbase just to eke out additional profits.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The tariff and trade war between the U.S. and China has claimed one of its first victims, albeit an unlikely one. In response to the May 2 deadline, Retroid moved <em>up</em> the timeline for shipping the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Pocket Flip 2 and Pocket Classic</a>. Preorders for the Flip 2 began shipping earlier this week, with Retroid ramping up shipments for the Pocket Classic just yesterday.</p><p>Even with the Hongkong Post halting any shipments from China to the U.S., we assumed "no news was good news." It turns out that's not the case, as an announcement was made on X (and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.gg/6HdBbH88Tj">Retroid Discord</a>) that the Kiwi, Teal, and Berry colors will not arrive in time to be shipped. The announcement also explains that "All shipping agencies will not accept US-bound packages from China, starting 4/25/25."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update on RP Classic shipping to US customers: pic.twitter.com/nHCnnpq5OO<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1912862898168213798">April 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>I wasn't personally aware of the 4/25 cutoff date for shipments between the two countries. However, it doesn't come as much of a surprise given the hostile nature of the situation. Nevertheless, this doesn't bode well for anyone, not just those who preordered the Retroid Pocket Classic. For now, the only recourse we have is to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/pages/about-us">contact Retroid</a> and request a different color, but who knows how long it will be before those supplies dry up.</p><p>If anything, it's a sign of things to come, meaning that even if you were willing to pay the tariff fees for a product, that decision has been taken out of your hands entirely. Instead, the package will either not be accepted at all or will be returned to the sender if it manages to slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>Sure, it's just a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a>, which is confined to a niche anyway. But the bigger question weighing on my mind now is how this will affect 2025 smartphone launches. Practically every phone passes through China at some point, even if it's just for the manufacturing of certain components before going to a factory in Vietnam, India, or elsewhere to be included in the assembly.</p><p>Currently, it doesn't appear that other countries are affected, indicating a good chance that this won't impact upcoming device releases. That may not be the case across the board, so it's possible that some devices are delayed or perhaps even outright canceled. And if you don't think phone makers are concerned about what could be on the horizon, look no further than Apple.</p>

<p>Recently, a report surfaced claiming that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/09/apple-stock-tariffs-china-iphones" target="_blank">Apple has flown</a> "at least 10 flights carrying iPhones and other products" from China, in an effort to avoid the tariff wars. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-users-rush-to-upgrade-iphones-ahead-of-potential-tariffs-related-price-hikes-7640aa24" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>, there are "throngs of U.S. consumers who have rushed to buy new iPhones over the past week, expecting that new tariffs will prompt Apple to raise prices."</p><p>Another report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://macmagazine.com.br/post/2025/04/16/brasil-faz-parte-da-linha-de-producao-do-iphone-16e/" target="_blank">suggests</a> that Apple is relocating the manufacturing of the iPhone 16e to Brazil, a country not affected by the tariff disputes between the U.S. and China. While we haven't seen similar reports about devices from Samsung or Google, we also wouldn't be surprised if they start to appear in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Shortly after Apple loaded up ten planes of products, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">Trump Administration announced</a> that "smartphones and other electronics components will be exempt" from the tariffs. All of this came after companies like Razer and Framework halted shipments of certain devices to the U.S. Meanwhile, other companies, such as Lenovo with the forthcoming Legion Go S, and OnePlus with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-releases-with-a-hefty-price-tag-in-the-us-and-we-dont-know-why">Watch 3</a>, raised prices in an attempt to "get ahead" of the storm.</p><p>Meanwhile, the majority of Android gaming handhelds are completely designed and manufactured in China. And upon release, it's a DHL or 4PX shipment that might get transferred to USPS before landing on your doorstep. And while Retroid is the one being currently affected, there are other gaming handhelds from the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ace-is-compact-powerful-and-i-cant-wait">AYANEO</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds">OneXSugar</a> that are expected to be released in the near future.</p>

<p>Given that shipping agencies will apparently no longer be accepting packages, it could spell disaster for some of these companies. Alternatively, it may mean that your package needs to make a stop in a different country before it can be delivered to your front door. The logistics of that idea alone are enough to give me the heebie-jeebies, so I don't even want to imagine what it would actually be like.</p><p>The craziest part about the entire situation isn't the back-and-forth between the U.S. and China. It's just how fluid everything is, and that by this time tomorrow, another frustrating layer is peeled back. Hell, it could just all be gone, and we go back to the way things were before January. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be in the cards.</p>

<p>Google says that its Wear OS 5.1 update makes the Pixel Watch 3 and previous models much better at handling "challenging" step count tracking, like pushing a stroller or shopping cart. I put this new system to the test.</p><p>Google's Wear OS 5.1 community post states that the "improved algorithm ensures your steps are counted with exceptional accuracy" in scenarios where you're not freely swinging your wrist with each step, such as walking with hiking poles or holding a phone. That can be a challenge for any smartwatch.</p><p>My Pixel Watch 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-wear-os-5-1-update-mess-has-me-annoyed-and-looking-for-solutions">didn't receive the update for a month</a>, but after the Pixel Watch team manually added mine to their update list, I took it out for some monotonous step tests. I rolled a cart through each grocery store aisle, hiked a trail with trekking poles, and took my dad's walker around the house — all while counting every actual step to compare.</p><p>Then I closed things off by conducting a straightforward walking test using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review" target="_blank">Garmin Fenix 8</a>, as Garmin is almost always <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test" target="_blank">the most accurate brand for step count</a>. Here are the results!</p>

<h2 id="how-well-the-new-pixel-watch-3-step-count-algorithm-works-2">How well the new Pixel Watch 3 step count algorithm works</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="FLMYnEWEzKspLHzsWVEWpj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-step-count" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 on a wrist showing the Steps Tile, with 10,619 steps (Goal met)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FLMYnEWEzKspLHzsWVEWpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In past checks, my Fitbit or Pixel Watch models weren't especially accurate for step count, typically falling short of the mark. So, besides "challenging" scenarios, I wanted to see if this new algorithm would catch normal steps, too.</p><p>Since many people aim to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month" target="_blank">walk 10,000 steps a day</a>, I used the Pixel Watch 3 and Garmin Fenix 8 to track 10,000 steps, tapping my simple counting app every 10 steps until I reached the 1,000 mark. I held the phone on my Garmin side to make sure the Pixel Watch 3 would swing naturally.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 ended at 9,896 (104 steps short), while the Garmin Fenix 8 ended at 10,050 (50 steps extra). Garmin performed better, as I expected, though frankly, it usually does a little better than that.</p><p>While the Pixel Watch 3 lost the step-count battle, my past Pixel Watch 2 and Fitbit Sense 2 tests have ranged from 200–300 steps off across 5,000 steps. Proportionally, the accuracy gap isn't as wide as it once was, which you can possibly attribute to the algorithm change.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qiyo4WfeEBRQGJxhhJczpj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-vs-Garmin-Fenix-8-steps" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 (left) and Garmin Fenix 8 (right), both showing their respective step counts of 11,442 and 11,747." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qiyo4WfeEBRQGJxhhJczpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In another test, I walked 8,000 steps while holding a trekking pole on the same side as my Pixel Watch 3. Because you take 4–6 steps for every single motion of the walking stick, it's easy for the step count to fall well short. I was curious if the algorithm could fix that.</p><p>I ended up measuring 7,857, or 143 steps short. Funnily enough, instead of the usual auto-detected walk activity, it asked me if I was using an elliptical near the end of the walk, because of the consistent rounded motion of my arm.</p><p>While the results were slightly less accurate than unimpeded walking, I did notice that I was 90 steps short after 2,000 steps, but then only lost 50 steps for the remaining 6,000. I wonder if the Watch got better at figuring out my walking pattern over time. Meanwhile, my Garmin watch inflated my step count to about 8,300, which I attribute to holding my phone in that hand. Still, not the best result!</p>

<p>As for walking with a shopping cart, I had a little bit of trouble keeping exact count of my steps while looking at deal prices and stepping around other customers. But what I can tell you is that the Pixel Watch 3 was either dead-on at counting my steps... or couldn't detect them.</p><p>Mime walking with a shopping cart, and you'll see the problem. If you move forward normally, your wrists won't bend, and your arms stay fixed; there's nothing for the algorithm to work with. So I'd walk 100 steps, look down, and see that both Fitbit and Garmin had only caught a couple of dozen steps, or none at all.</p><p>However, when I increased my pace, walking up and down the aisles without slowing, both watches could detect my rolling gait more easily. After 200 steps, the Watch 3 ended up with almost exactly that number added.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Pixel Watch 3 and Fenix 8 measured 742 and 745 steps, respectively. My actual count was at least a couple hundred steps higher, but I just appreciated that they caught anything at all. With other brands, you may only get a few hundred steps total after spending an hour in the store.</p>

<p>The new Wear OS 5.1 algorithm also includes better wheelchair tracking and stroller tracking, though I couldn't test either.</p><p>My guess is that stroller and shopping cart tracking will be pretty similar: If you drift along slowly, the Watch 3 won't catch your movement, but walk fast and there'll be enough subtle vertical motion for the algorithm to catch.</p><p>As for wheelchair pushes, that's a significant and consistent motion — like walking with a trekking pole — so I'd assume the Watch 3 will catch most of them, even if it falls slightly short.</p><p>I felt awkward testing my dad's walker for more than a couple of minutes — it felt too much like I was feigning a disability — but in that time, the Watch 3 had no trouble recognizing my steps. It might not do as well if you have a shuffling gait, however.</p><p>Overall, even if I wouldn't say the Pixel Watch 3 quite lives up to the "exceptional accuracy" claim in Google's blog post, it does decently in scenarios where other smartwatches would struggle to register steps, including Garmin. And I certainly appreciate the effort!</p>

<p>It was a surreal sensation and one that I wasn't expecting when I tried out the Woojer Haptic Vest 3 haptic vest for the first time. What started out as wonderment quickly turned into a minor addiction. What other games might deliver such tactile feedback, and what games would feel very different because of it?</p><p>A haptic vest like the Woojer Haptic Vest 3 allowed me to feel every blast, every shot, and to better understand the physical makeup of the virtual world I visit weekly when I play Breachers with friends. I've had a Woojer vest for a while, but never got around to using it regularly. Now I'm kicking myself for missing out on so many great moments that would have otherwise been even better with this haptic vest.</p><p>However, Woojer isn't limited to virtual reality, and it's not just designed for games created explicitly for it. Woojer's fascinating haptic technology works by funneling sound into a processor, which is specially coded to turn that sound into vibration. In a rudimentary sense, it's like wearing a full-body subwoofer, and it works for any game you play, movie you watch, or even the music you listen to; it quickly became my go-to peripheral for any gaming-related activity this month.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-heck-is-a-haptic-vest-anyway-2">What the heck is a haptic vest, anyway?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="45b3GoaG57vpVQoQYbjgoX" name="woojer-series-3-wearing-01" alt="Wearing a Woojer Haptic Vest 3 and a Meta Quest 3 with OnePlus Buds 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45b3GoaG57vpVQoQYbjgoX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've been gaming as long as I have, you might remember the first time you used a controller with rumble in it. For me, it was Star Fox 64, which came with a rumble pack in the box. It clicked into the Nintendo 64's controller and delivered the most immersive experience I'd ever had up until that moment. Suddenly, my hands could feel all the bombs going off in the game, the buildings falling around me as I evaded them, and every painful hit from the final boss.</p><p>A haptic vest takes that experience and transfers it to your entire torso, delivering a haptic experience you simply have to try. I was skeptical of this experience at first because Woojer's design differs from that of other haptic vests, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhaptics.com/en/" target="_blank">bHaptics</a>, which require specific coding in games. That means Woojer's haptic experience isn't better or worse than the competition; it's simply different.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A haptic vest takes the idea of controller rumble or haptics and elevates the experience by adding them to your whole torso.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If you're curious about the differences, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aXbKo501NY">here's a great video</a> that illustrates how a bHaptics vest feels specifically in Breachers. The vest and its accompanying wrist accessories will vibrate when you shoot a gun, grab an object, or get shot yourself. It'll also vibrate specific parts of the vest if a grenade goes off near you, helping to simulate things you come in direct contact with.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="32CMByQaLeiora4S67tJQj" name="woojer-series-3-app-main-screen" alt="The Woojer app with a Woojer Haptic Vest 3 connected" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/32CMByQaLeiora4S67tJQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To an extent, the Woojer vest also does that, but Woojer's take is more about environmental feel rather than specific body feel. When I shoot a gun while wearing the Woojer, I feel the power of it.</p><p>But I also feel the subtle rumble from a grenade that went off on the other side of the room, and the low rumble of a wall being blasted open a few rooms over feels palpably realistic, too. The bHaptics vest doesn't deliver that because it's not really designed for that, which is fine. I'm not knocking bHaptics, just trying to illustrate the difference.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Woojer's sound-based model allowed me to feel environmental sounds as much as ones that directly impact me as a player.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The more general nature of Woojer's design also means that you feel intense music in a way that feels almost like marching to a war drum. I was playing Monster Hunter Wilds through GeForce Now on my phone while hooked up to my Woojer Haptic Vest 3 vest, and I felt every pounding drum in the music. It felt exciting and lent a depth to the audio that previously wasn't there.</p><p>It's proof that Woojer's experience isn't just confined to virtual reality games, and it works just as well for movies. I recently watched a fan cut of The Hobbit with some friends in Bigscreen VR — a virtual theater experience where you can hang out with friends and watch movies or videos, all while wearing a VR vest. It made me feel like I was sitting in one of those "4D" chair experiences some theaters have, but I didn't have to leave my house to get it.</p>
<h2 id="how-woojer-s-tech-works-and-what-it-s-best-for-2">How Woojer's tech works and what it's best for</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KRfMQZvR7PbDsc9H6QBym" name="woojer-series-3-wearing-connections" alt="The control panel on the front of a Woojer Haptic Vest 3 with a 3.5mm input cable connected" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KRfMQZvR7PbDsc9H6QBym.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Woojer vest's haptic motors operate entirely on sound. You can pipe the sound in either through a 3.5mm cable or via a wireless Bluetooth connection. From there, you'll need to select an audio output, and you'll have the same options: 3.5mm audio cable or Bluetooth.</p><p>That means your audio source — whether it's your Meta Quest 3 headset, your phone, or a gaming console — connects to the vest, and then your vest connects to your earbuds, headphones, or speakers. As you might expect, the 3.5mm cable option requires no configuration at all, while Bluetooth is best set up with the Woojer app.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>An audio source (headset, console, phone) connects to the vest, which then connects to a pair of earbuds or speakers.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Woojer vest features its own battery pack, located on the back, which lasts approximately 8 hours on a single charge. The vest connects to the Woojer app on your phone, so as long as you're using the app, you should always be aware of how much battery is left. This app also gives you control over audio sources and output, so you can specify which earbuds your audio outputs to.</p>

<p>As you might expect, Bluetooth audio introduces some latency, but I didn't find this to be a problem even when playing VR games. The obvious reason for this is that haptic feedback is less important to your brain than visual or audio cues, particularly in VR, so a slight delay of 1/10th of a second from the action to the feeling won't make you feel sick or anything like that. In fact, I wasn't even aware of the delay until I pulled up the app and saw the gauge.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The ability to use both 3.5mm cables and Bluetooth ensured I had a great experience no matter what audio equipment was available.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Part of the reason is that the app has several different modes that you can choose from to ensure you get the right experience. The VR gaming setting, for instance, strips away as much processing as possible to reduce latency. Setting it to gaming also helps reduce the amount of vibration caused by music, leaving most of the feeling to actions in the game rather than arbitrary rumbling to the beat.</p><p>These settings are crucial for the best experience, and while you certainly can operate the vest without the app, you'll be missing out on a lot by avoiding it.</p>

<p>Haptic intensity and volume can be adjusted either on the vest's control panel, located in the location of a typical shirt pocket on the front of the vest, or via the Woojer app on the phone. The default haptic intensity is rather comfortable for me, but I've shown the vest off to some people who wanted to jack it up to get some extra feeling.</p><p>Turning the intensity up too high will trigger a vibration on nearly everything the vest "hears." If for no other reason, I don't recommend using it at maximum vibration because it rattles too much and ends up responding to things you don't necessarily want, like music.</p>

<p>The vest itself is rather soft and comfortable, and while it certainly adds a bit of weight to your torso, this doesn't feel like wearing a weighted vest at the gym. The material is quite breathable, but it will make you sweat a bit more during warm weather. In the winter, it feels particularly nice. Woojer sells some nice, breathable (and rather cool-looking) washable linings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/woojer-vest-3-washable-lining-apex-hunter/6563853.p?skuId=6563853">for about $30</a> if sweat becomes a problem.</p>

<p>That brings me to the types of games you'll want to use the vest for. You could use it for anything and everything, but I've found that games with specific tactile experiences work best.</p><p>Think rhythm games like Beat Saber or Beatable, where the vest will let you <em>feel</em> the music as much as hear it. This is one where low-latency audio is best, since a bit of lag in the haptics could actually throw off your rhythm.</p><p>Using the Woojer vest in shooters like Breachers or Contractors delivers a fascinating sense of immersion and environmental awareness that I didn't expect. I used the wall breaching analogy earlier, where I felt the explosion on the other side of the room and was able to more quickly spin around and understand where the explosion came from than when I wasn't wearing the vest.</p>

<p>Although it's a bit more work to strap on a vest and plug in before gaming, there's no chance I play most VR games without wearing the vest. Obviously, I'm not going to be strapping it on for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/walkabout-minigolf-meta-quest-mars-gardens">Walkabout Mini Golf</a> or strategy games like Civ VII VR, but everything else benefits immensely from the immersion factor of the vest.</p><p>I was skeptical going in, but Woojer made me a believer in its tech. Haptics enthusiasts and anyone seeking more immersion and spatial awareness in their games should definitely consider picking one up. That said, it is a fairly costly investment, comparable to the cost of a second Meta Quest 3S.</p>

<ul><li>A batch of "exclusive" information claims to have nailed what the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 will bring to the table.</li><li>It seems the device will upgrade its display to a 7-inch Super HD foldable screen with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, and a 50MP selfie lens.</li><li>The phone could also sport a much larger battery with souped up wired charging.</li><li>Motorola's official teasers state the Razr 2025 series will debut on April 24.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another wave of leaks about Motorola's next top-level foldable has come to light, hinting at its potential upgrades.</p><p>Alleged "exclusive" information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/motorola-razr-60-ultra-specifications-leak-exclusive/">91Mobiles</a> with X tipster OnLeaks claims the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 (Razr 60 Ultra internationally) could see a few hardware changes. One of the major changes is the swap for Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC</a>, which would give the Razr a huge power boost if true. Additional purported upgrades are seemingly minimal and could affect its internal screen.</p><p>The publication suggests consumers could see a slightly bigger 7-inch Super HD foldable screen. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">previous model</a> offered a 6.9-inch pOLED screen, so the change might be worth it if true.</p><p>Other rumored changes include the foldable's front-facing selfie camera. The tipster's information alleges the Razr Plus 2025 could jump to a 50MP lens instead of the same 32MP, f/2.4 lens that its predecessor provides. While these are more "in your face," speculation continues for the phone's power supply.</p><p>A larger 4,7000mAh battery could find its way into the foldable. This is reportedly paired with 68W wired fast charging (a huge boost) and 30W wireless charging capabilities.</p>

<p>The supposed specifications suggest the next Razr Plus could continue to offer its larger 4-inch cover display with a 165Hz refresh rate, as last year's. The Razr is also expected to keep its 50MP primary and ultrawide-angle lenses. Moreover, consumers will likely see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> during its setup.</p><p>We've seen some of these alleged specifications mentioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/alleged-motorola-razr-2025-series-leaks-again">in a previous leak</a>, so perhaps there's some merit to them. One thing that stood out earlier in April was the supposed color options for consumers. Consumers can potentially expect a revamped red option, as well as a dark green faux leather and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-wooden-finish-video-leaked">a wood finish</a>. What's more, tipsters at the time speculate the company will pack even more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> into its next foldable — and its base model — than we've seen before.</p><p>You might've received the emails, too, but Motorola has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/official-motorola-razr-2025-teaser-clip">started teasing</a> its next foldable launch on social media. Though brief, we were given a glimpse at three Razrs unfolding in various colors. Each model gave us a look at a different color, but the most important bit was the date: April 24.</p><p>We're just a week away from Motorola's grand reveal of the Razr 2025 series.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Good Lock launcher for Galaxy devices has appeared on the Play Store.</li><li>This signals its global release, which also comes with a complete redesign.</li><li>Samsung alerted users to Good Lock's impending redesign/global availability in January, and it seems the rollout coincides with its One UI 7 release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's launcher for Galaxy has been spotted sporting its new design down the global runway.</p><p>Good Lock's global availability was spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.goodlock&hl=en_US">on the Play Store</a> this week, coinciding with Samsung's One UI 7 update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/samsung-good-lock-play-store-release-global/">9to5Google</a>). Additionally, a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/the-wait-is-over-good-lock-is-finally-available-globally/">SamMobile</a> confirms the launcher's availability for more countries globally via the Galaxy Store. While the Play Store doesn't get too in-depth about its complete redesign, it gives us a glimpse of its refreshed main plug-in page.</p><p>The launcher breaks things down to give users quick access to "Extensions" and device "Gestures" in small bubbles. Beneath that is a complete list of available plug-ins, which seems to have remained similar to its previous iteration. The plug-ins page now offers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> name with the "Your Galaxy Your Way" tagline in a purple-to-pink gradient banner.</p><p>The "You" tab features more of the same refreshments with defined "Favorites" and "Settings in Effect" categories.</p>

<p>Strangely, as 9to5 notes, the Play Store's Galaxy device compatibility is a little wonky. The store reportedly lacks mention of devices aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25</a> "when installing remotely." It's unclear if this is a visual bug. The post adds that the Galaxy S24 can download it, provided it is running One UI 7. The publication states it's tried to install the launcher on a Fold 6, but it's oddly "blocked."</p><p>Considering it's recent appearance, there's likely a few issues Samsung needs to sort out for its Galaxy devices globally. If you're encountering similar problems, it might be worth trying the launcher on the Galaxy Store instead.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">started preparing us</a> for a global Good Lock launch in January when it also highlighted its expected redesign. The company announced Good Lock would be available for "all countries" via the Play Store. A first for its Galaxy launcher. Users will find customization plug-ins like Home Up. In One UI 7, users can get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-home-up-complete-customize-demo">pretty creative and wacky</a> with it, as one Reddit user discovered.</p><p>The Korean OEM pushed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-good-lock-launcher-refresh-update-rolls-out">small QoL update</a> for the Good Lock in March. The patch cleaned up its "phrasing" while also altering the descriptions of a few features.</p>

<p>For a limited time, Best Buy is carving up to $150 off the price of the OnePlus 13 when you activate the phone through your carrier today. Easily one of the best Android phones on the market, the 13 is a sleek, versatile device with a revolutionary IP69 construction, lightning-fast processor, and one of the best displays we've ever seen on a smartphone. Deals on the flagship phone are very uncommon, so place your order before Best Buy's sale comes to a close on April 20th. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-13-512gb-unlocked-black-eclipse/6609357.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c1bb34be-07a8-4534-8f88-9764596d4935" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

Like I mentioned above, deals on the OnePlus 13 have been few and far between since the phone&apos;s release a few months back, so don&apos;t wait too long if you&apos;re interested. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's Android 15-based OS upgrade is reportedly returning for users in one region today (Apr. 17).</p><p>A post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1912799118511980610">X by Tarun Vats</a> is drawing awareness to One UI 7's rollout restart for the Galaxy S24 series (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-plus-ultra-one-ui-7-rollout-resumed/">SamMobile</a>). Users expecting the update globally may have to wait a while longer (still) as Vats states the build was spotted in South Korea. However, what users should look out for is build vS928NKSU4BYD9 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series whenever it hits your device.</p><p>Interestingly, the provided screenshot details the updated One UI 7 build is ~292MB. It's likely the smaller size will impact those who received the massive upgrade before Samsung's pause. The update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/stable-one-ui-7-rolls-out-to-users-both-in-the-us-and-european-regions">originally launched</a> with a 5GB download, so this might jump slightly for those who never got it to begin with.</p><p>Of course, it's worth keeping your eyes peeled as we finish the week. With One UI 7's resuming in South Korea, it's likely global regions will see it in mid-April next week.</p>

<p>One UI 7's rollout <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/stable-one-ui-7-rolls-out-to-users-both-in-the-us-and-european-regions">started on time</a> on April 10 for users in the U.S. and Europe for the Galaxy S24 series. Alongside the past-gen slab phone, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 were included, similar to how Samsung worked its rollout in Korea. However, Galaxy user excitement dwindled severely once the Korean OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/serious-bug-pushes-samsung-to-stall-one-ui-7-rollout-globally">paused the update</a> following a "serious bug."</p><p>Samsung pulled the patch four days later on April 14 after it identified a critical issue with its software. A tipster reported that the bug gave some Galaxy S24 users problems with unlocking their devices. Samsung not only suspended its rollout in the U.S. and Europe, but also in China and Vietnam, to name a couple more.</p><p>Samsung then informed Android Central it's been forced to update its One UI 7 rollout schedule to better reflect the times.</p><p>Speaking of, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/updated-one-ui-7-rollout-schedule">one person on Reddit</a> seems to have discovered what this new schedule could be, following a supposed Samsung Members app notification. The alert reportedly states One UI 7 should be available for the Galaxy S24, Flip 6, and Fold 6 in April. A few other older devices could begin seeing it in May.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-42">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The RedMagic 10 Air is thinner than most flagship gaming phones but still stacked with high-end hardware.</li><li>It boasts a 9-layer cooling system with liquid metal and a vapor chamber, stopping instances of overheating during long gaming sessions.</li><li>RedMagic also baked in AI features like real-time voice translation, screenshot editing, and a customizable Magic Key for quick access.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>RedMagic has pulled the wraps off its newest gaming phone in China, and it’s aiming straight at mobile gamers who want power without the extra weight. The RedMagic 10 Air is slimmer than most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">top-tier gaming phones</a>, but still packed with high-end specs.</p><p>At its core, the phone includes a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which is about as fast as phones get right now.</p><p>But the real trick is the RedCore R3 co-processor, which handles all the background nonsense (audio, haptics, lighting) so the main chip doesn’t have to. Basically, it’s supposed to help with stuff like keeping the game looking good and stopping the phone from overheating.</p>
<h2 id="cooling-that-doesn-t-cut-corners-2">Cooling that doesn’t cut corners</h2>
<p>Speaking of overheating, RedMagic is making a big deal about the 10 Air's cooling system. The phone ships with a 9-layer ICE Cooling System with liquid metal and a vapor chamber, which is the kind of tech you usually see in gaming laptops. The promise is that this will keep the phone running consistently, even during those super long gaming sessions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:860px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bXXzivRUVicu2npFiJNnMB" name="RedMagic-10-Air-white" alt="RedMagic 10 Air in white" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bXXzivRUVicu2npFiJNnMB.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="860" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RedMagic)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The screen is a 6.8-inch AMOLED, which should give you a decent size for gaming. It boasts a high refresh rate (120Hz) for smooth visuals and gets pretty bright (1,600 nits), so everything on screen will look crisp whether you’re indoors or outside.</p><p>The touch response is nuts too: 2,000Hz touch sampling for instant feedback, and 520Hz shoulder triggers that’ll make tapping to reload or aim feel a lot more precise. And for those who like extra controls, it has shoulder triggers that you can map to in-game actions.</p>
<h2 id="big-battery-fast-charge-2">Big battery, fast charge</h2>
<p>Battery life is always a concern, but RedMagic claims the 10 Air can last up to 28 hours with normal use, thanks to the 6,000mAh battery. This is despite the phone's slim profile. It also supports fast charging, so you can top it up quickly.</p><p>Aside from the usual performance talk, there’s some clever stuff baked in too. AI helps with voice translation, so you can understand teammates mid-game or while traveling. It also does quick edits on screenshots and photos for sharing online. And there’s a customizable side button (called the Magic Key) for things like launching apps or features you use often.</p><p>Aesthetically, the phone has a matte metal frame and a glass back designed to resist fingerprints. Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-redmagic-10-pro-is-basically-a-power-bank-attached-to-a-gaming-phone">RedMagic 10 Pro</a>, it’s got RGB lighting because it's a gaming phone. There’s also an extra programmable button on the side for quick actions.</p><p>If you're in China, the RedMagic 10 Air is available now with a starting price of 3,499RMB (approximately $476). It comes in a couple of colors (Twilight Black and Hailstone White), with a Flare Orange version coming later. For those outside China, the international release is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.redmagic.gg/pages/redmagic-10-air-launch" target="_blank">scheduled for April 23, 2025</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Chipolo finally updated its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers#section-best-overall">Bluetooth trackers</a> to work with the new Google Find My Device network. Dubbed the Chipolo POP series, the products launched on April 14, 2025. The good news is that the brand's trackers are ubiquitously compatible with both Google and Apple's networks, making them excellent for most households.</p><p>POP trackers have improved specs compared to the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-one-bluetooth-tracker-review">Chipolo trackers that I reviewed</a> previously. At $29 apiece, the pricing is just a tad higher, but it's only a dollar or two more so it's acceptable.</p><p>You get decent upgrades for such a small price hike, such as an improved 300ft Bluetooth range and a more robust IP55 water and dust-resistant rating. There's a new remote selfie feature that enables users to snap pictures on their phone from a distance by clicking the POP button.</p><p>The Chipolo POP retains 120 decibels of max loudness and a one-year-long battery that's easily replaceable. And of course, as is customary, Chipolo's POP trackers come in bright colors such as yellow, blue, green, and red in addition to staples like black and white.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="EpZxG5Jvf8KSoXJLmRzLQj" name="Chipolo POP Bluetooth tracker" alt="Chipolo POP Bluetooth tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EpZxG5Jvf8KSoXJLmRzLQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="844" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All the best names in the Bluetooth tracker biz updated their lineups following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/googles-find-my-device-network-is-live-but-it-isnt-working-as-expected">relaunch of the Google Find My Device</a> network in June 2024. Even Motorola threw its hat in the ring, releasing a stylish and colorful accessory called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/motorola-moto-tag-hands-on-review">Moto Tag</a>.</p><p>Most trackers only work with a single tracking ecosystem. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/new-tile-2024-lineup-life360-app">new Tile by Life360</a> trackers from 2024 only work with Life360's network. Despite the fact that it supports iOS devices, the Moto Tag is only compatible with Google Find My Device.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/pebblebee-announces-google-find-my-device-compatible-trackers">Pebblebee's refreshed tracker lineup</a> from 2024 supports both Google and Apple's networks, but users can only register their tracker with either one regardless, limiting the potential trackability.</p><p>Like Pebblebee, Chipolo took the same route with the POP tracker. Sure, it's compatible with both Apple and Google's Find My Device networks, but you're forced to choose either one instead of using them together.</p><p>Users aren't looking to play a trivial game of "this or that" when buying trackers; they just want to find lost stuff as efficiently as possible.</p>
<h2 id="a-google-and-apple-alliance-needs-to-happen-2">A Google and Apple alliance needs to happen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1489px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="pRbtXSHwoW7tqK8fjANASj" name="Chipolo POP Bluetooth tracker" alt="Chipolo POP Bluetooth tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pRbtXSHwoW7tqK8fjANASj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1489" height="838" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a major drawback for Google. Back when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">I tested the Google's Find My Device network</a> with the latest trackers, and I was left severely disappointed. The network just doesn't function as well as Apple's network, so it's likely that most folks will end up opting for Apple's network instead.</p><p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-responds-find-my-device-criticism">Google has since put in more effort</a> to improve the usability and functionality of its network, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">adding handy features</a> such as offline tracking, shared items, and third-party compatibility, the cold hard truth is that it still falls short.</p><p>Even if we now have new trackers that can work on both networks (but not simultaneously), most users will probably end up using the Apple network simply because it's more reliable. It's either having to choose between Apple and Google, or the alternative Tile by Life360 network which has a web of millions of devices to rely on for findability.</p><p>In a world where Bluetooth multipoint is commonplace and we're moving towards the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">evolution of Bluetooth called Auracast</a>, I can't comprehend why Bluetooth trackers are limited in this way, especially when considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">how Google's new Find My Device network actually works</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Why are companies not making trackers that function on both Google AND Apple's networks?</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Why are companies not making trackers that function on both Google <strong>AND</strong> Apple's networks? Both brands would benefit from such an alliance and so would the users. they've already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/unwanted-tracking-notifications-rolling-out-ios-android">partnered up to create the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers</a> spec makes it possible to deliver unknown tracking notifications to both iOS and Android users. I imagine enabling cross-functionality between the two networks would be an extension of this.</p><p>This is not talked about enough, even though this could be highly beneficial to consumers. So I'm asking Google, Apple, and Bluetooth tracker brands, on behalf of the world. Please make a tracker that can leverage both Google and Apple's Find My Device networks at the same time.</p>

As long as you update your phone as soon as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-play-services-april-auto-reboot-security-changelog">new security patches are available</a>, you're usually covered. However, there's an intricate government-supported program operating to make that all possible, and it almost went dark today.</p><p>After roughly 24 hours of uncertainty, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) announced that it would continue funding the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) on the day its previous contract was set to expire. Today, April 16, a spokesperson for the CISA told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649835/cve-cybersecurity-program-contract-renewed" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that the agency "executed the option period on the contract to ensure there will be no lapse in critical CVE services."</p><p>But it went down to the wire in a move that could've sent the entire globe into a tech security nightmare.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="T2CdpCDsKhZumT2g6thqKF" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-november-update" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 showing "Your watch is up to date" with the November 5 security patch, next to a Pixel 9a showing the current date (April 10)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2CdpCDsKhZumT2g6thqKF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It all has to do with the CVE program, which identifies and tracks security issues in public view, from the point a potential problem is identified to the time when a proper fix is issued. It has nearly 500 partners that include security researchers, open-source developers, and major companies — including big ones like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.</p><p>If the CVE program sounds familiar, that's probably because you've seen a CVE code mentioned in an article (like one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-zero-day-exploit-february-2024-detailed">many CVE-related ones on Android Central</a>) or the release notes of an update. They're also a major part of monthly releases on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-security-everything-you-need-to-know">Android Security Bulletin</a>. These codes, like <strong>CVE-2024-53104</strong>, start with CVE followed by the year and a number, and create a universal database to track security flaws across devices, platforms, and companies.</p>

<p>The CVE program has been active for 25 years, beginning in 1999. It has become invaluable to the security community, serving as a universal way for researchers, developers, companies, and the public to work together to discover and patch crucial vulnerabilities. More importantly, it publicly states whether a vulnerability is believed to have been actively exploited by bad actors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8zGfJm3MX3uZ4iJo3AP9TK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-5" alt="Android 15 logo on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8zGfJm3MX3uZ4iJo3AP9TK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Leading security researchers have pointed out the consequences of the CVE program shutting down, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/lukOlejnik">Lukasz Olejnik on X (formerly Twitter).</a></p><p>"The consequence will be a breakdown in coordination between vendors, analysts, and defense systems — no one will be certain they are referring to the same vulnerability," wrote Olejnik, a scholar with advanced degrees in computer science and information technology law with specializations in privacy. "Total chaos, and a sudden weakening of cybersecurity across the board."</p>
<h2 id="the-crisis-has-been-avoided-for-now-2">The crisis has been avoided... for now?</h2>
<p>Luckily, it appears that the crisis has been avoided, as the federal government will continue to fund the CVE program for at least the near future. However, the decision coming down to the wire as the Trump administration slashes federal funding across the board puts the CVE program in a more uncertain position now than at any point in its 25-year history.</p><p>"The CVE Program is invaluable to the cyber community and a priority of CISA," the spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge. "We appreciate our partners’ and stakeholders’ patience."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wQ5kQ7Tz2Q38S3qddmfDT4" name="android-15-23.jpg" alt="Android 15 Easter egg on Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wQ5kQ7Tz2Q38S3qddmfDT4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But that final green light didn't come quick enough, as the security world already started making plans to keep the CVE program up and running — even without federal funding. CVE board members created the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thecvefoundation.org" target="_blank">CVE Foundation</a>, a nonprofit planned for in secret for the past year that would ensure the CVE mission continues.</p><p>"CVE, as a cornerstone of the global cybersecurity ecosystem, is too important to be vulnerable itself," said Kent Landfield, an officer of the CVE Foundation, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thecvefoundation.org" target="_blank">press release</a>. "Cybersecurity professionals around the globe rely on CVE identifiers and data as part of their daily work, from security tools and advisories to threat intelligence and response. Without CVE, defenders are at a massive disadvantage against global cyber threats."</p><p>The foundation explains that it is concerned that having a single government sponsor could create "a single point of failure in the vulnerability management ecosystem."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xUHSDHLtrfvvsGRZu6dnoH" name="Android-16-logo-orange-oneplus-13-03" alt="An orange and blue Android 16 logo on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xUHSDHLtrfvvsGRZu6dnoH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The CVE program is a critical part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-galaxy-s25-series">Android security</a>, and it should be relevant to every single person who touches an Android-based device. Although government funding has been acquired for now, the moves that have been set in motion by the last-minute decision may not be reversed. The CVE Foundation is here, and it might be here to stay.</p><p>There's no word on whether the CVE Foundation will continue to operate now that the CVE program has retained U.S. government funding, but the foundation said more information will be released "over the coming days." The immediate U.S. government funding doesn't solve the long-term problem the CVE Foundation has identified — the possibility of having a single point of failure — so there still may be a reason for it to exist.</p><p>Regardless of how this all plays out, the decision to fund the CVE program should've never come this close to ending a crucial global security program. Most of us have the luxury to not think about device security that often, and it's programs like the CVE that allow us that privilege.</p>

<hr>
<p>While other online gaming storefronts allowed Android users to buy games from their smartphones, like Steam, this feature was notably absent from the Xbox app. Now, that's finally changing. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/16/xbox-april-update-buy-games-xbx-app-stream-your-own-game-console/" target="_blank">Xbox April Update</a>, the platform added support for buying games, purchasing add-ons, subscribing to Game Pass, and redeem Perks straight from an iOS Android device.</p><p>The expanded functionality is set to become available for beta testers on both Android and iOS first, with all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store users</a> and App Store users getting the feature at a later date. For users that have payment information saved with Xbox, it'll only take two clicks on their Android phone to buy a new game. This streamlines the browsing and purchasing process, which can be difficult on an Xbox due to controller limitations.</p><p>If this sounds familiar, it should: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/xbox-app-to-allow-purchases-gaming-following-google-court-ruling">Xbox announced plans to support this feature</a> way back in October 2024. It resulted from a U.S. court decision that barred Google from mandating developers use Google Play Billing to process in-app purchases. But due to court delays, Microsoft had to put its plans on pause until things could be sorted out.</p>

<p>Buying Xbox games from the Android mobile app is now possible due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-legal-setback-could-open-the-door-for-more-app-stores-on-android">requirement for developers to use Google Play Billing</a> being dropped, according to Microsoft. With Google Play Billing, Xbox would've had to surrender a cut to Google for processing payments through the Play Store.</p><p>But Google tells Android Central that buying Xbox games via the Android app has always been possible. <br></p><p>“Microsoft has always been able to offer their Android users the ability to play and purchase Xbox games directly from their app – they've simply chosen not to,” said Dan Jackson, the head of policy communications for Android and Google Play, in a statement.</p><p>At the time, Xbox President Sarah Bond stated that these changes would make it possible for the company to offer Xbox purchases within the Android app. "The court's ruling to open up Google's mobile store in the US will allow more choice and flexibility," said Bond in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1844506029599707255%7Ctwgr%5E93c301d746ffdbe8e1ae9e448297bc277d6e4097%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fgaming%2Fandroid-games%2Fxbox-app-to-allow-purchases-gaming-following-google-court-ruling" target="_blank">October 2024 post</a>.</p><p>Aside from purchasing games and add-ons in the Xbox app, users can also remotely install those games on their Xbox console. So, users can buy an app on their Android phone and have it installed and ready to go by the time they return home.</p><p>Separately, Xbox is removing Remote Play support from the Android app, but it will still remain accessible on mobile through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xbox.com/remoteplay">xbox.com/remoteplay</a> website<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xbox.com/remoteplay">.</a></p>

<ul><li>Fitbit watches are soon losing support for Google Assistant.</li><li>Google announced that Assistant would be phased out on Fitbit watches in the coming weeks in a community post last month.</li><li>Fitbit owners can still use Amazon Alexa as a voice assistant in supported regions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Some Fitbit smartwatches support using a voice assistant like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> or Amazon Alexa, but Google is currently phasing out Assistant support. Owners of the Fitbit Sense, Fitbit Sense 2, Fitbit Versa 2, Fitbit Versa 3, and Fitbit Versa 4 will soon discover that Google Assistant is no longer available, if it hasn't disappeared already.</p><p>The phaseout was officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sense/Google-Assistant-will-no-longer-be-available-on-Fitbit-Sense-and-Versa-3/td-p/5735504" target="_blank">announced</a> last month, and email notices are being sent out to affected Fitbit users.</p><p>"Over the next few weeks we will be progressively phasing out Google Assistant on your Fitbit device," a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sense/Google-Assistant-will-no-longer-be-available-on-Fitbit-Sense-and-Versa-3/td-p/5735504" target="_blank">community post</a> explains. "This change means that Google Assistant voice control for activities will soon no longer be available on your Fitbit device."</p><p>Fitbit users of these devices can still use Amazon Alexa as their voice assistant in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14229424#Supported_countries&zippy=%2Cwhich-countries-and-languages-are-supported-by-alexa-built-in-on-fitbit" target="_blank">these supported regions</a>, including the U.S.</p>

<p>Google is following up its earlier community post and email notices with a notification sent to Fitbit watches (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-assistant-on-fitbit-coming-to-end-3545286/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). "Google Assistant on Fitbit watches is being turned down, this feature will stop working in the coming weeks," the notification reads.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/1jzgyj6/google_assistant_going_away">Google assistant going away</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit">r/fitbit</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>It might seem odd that Google, which owns Fitbit, is pushing users away from Google Assistant and toward Amazon Alexa. However, the move appears to be part of larger changes to Google Assistant. The voice assistant has seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-dialing-back-more-assistant-features-on-android-and-nest-devices">numerous feature deprecations since the start of 2024</a>, and will soon be replaced on mobile with Gemini.</p><p>Eventually, Gemini will replace Google Assistant on Wear OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-wear-os-sounds-an-awful-lot-like-google-assistant">at least in name</a>. But since Fitbit smartwatches run Fitbit OS — not Wear OS — it's far from guaranteed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will arrive on older Fitbit watches.</p><p>Amidst the announcement of the discontinuation of Assistant on Fitbit watches, there has been no official mention of a voice assistant replacement, aside from the aforementioned Alexa support.</p>

<hr>
<p>After launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a> last month, Nothing is now releasing a slew of new products under its CMF sub-brand. The CMF Buds 2 kick things off as the brand's latest pair of truly-wireless earbuds, which improve sound quality and add a fresh design for $59. It also teased the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which will be the next Nothing phone released under the CMF brand.</p><p>We don't know a whole lot about the CMF Phone 2 Pro just yet, but an official teaser from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1912430771585053086/photo/1" target="_blank">Nothing on X (formerly Twitter)</a> reveals the phone's processor. The budget smartphone will be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro, with Nothing describing the CMF Phone 2 as "powerful from the core."</p>

<p>It follows up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-by-nothing-phone-2-social-media-teaser">the first teaser Nothing shared</a> earlier this month, revealing the phone's design.</p><p>The MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro appears to be an iteration of the Dimensity 7300, which powered the CMF Phone 1. There is a new MediaTek Dimensity 7400 out, but CMF passed on that chipset in favor of a "Pro" version of the Dimensity 7300. Nothing has tweaked MediaTek chipsets before to offer enhanced performance, so this isn't a new concept for the CMF Phone 2 Pro.</p><p>Meanwhile, the CMF Buds 2 slot into the Nothing earbuds lineup right below the CMF Buds 2 Pro. At $59, they cost $10 less than the Buds 2 Pro at retail but represent a $20 increase compared to their predecessor. These products could compete for value in certain markets, as current discounts at U.S. retailers make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-convinced-nothings-cmf-buds-pro-2-are-the-only-budget-earbuds-worth-buying">Buds 2 Pro</a> cheaper than the newly-released Buds 2.</p>

<p>Nothing's CMF Buds 2 offer up to 55 hours of total playback time (including charging case), support dual connection, and have 48dB hybrid active noise-canceling support. They're also IP55 certified for dust, sweat, and water-resistance, making them suitable for workouts.</p><p>You can order the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/cmf-buds-2?" target="_blank">CMF Buds 2</a> today, with deliveries starting later this week.</p>

<p>OnePlus is all set to launch the 13T on April 24, and is leaving no stone unturned to market its small flagship device.</p><p>The company took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/3871046669">Weibo</a> to post an official trailer of the OnePlus 13T, showcasing it from all angles possible. With the caption, "Small screen big devil. OnePlus 13T is officially unveiled!"</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PTcnGy4EcnN7uKvcZdigq8" name="OnePlus 13T-teased" alt="OnePlus officially unveils the 13T" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTcnGy4EcnN7uKvcZdigq8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus/Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The company stated in the post that the phone is said to sport an all-new design that not only feels light in the hand but is also as powerful as a phone can get. In another post on Weibo, OnePlus showed the upcoming phone being held between the thumb and index finger— mimicking the "OK" hand gesture, implying that the device is as compact as it can get.</p><p>That said, from the looks of it, the OnePlus 13T will show up in three colorways: Black, Sliver, and Pink, with a possible overall matte finish. According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-oneplus-13t-just-inched-closer-to-launch-with-fresh-details-surfacing">previous leak </a>the official names of the colorways could be "Cloud Ink Black, Morning Mist Gray, and Heartbeat Pink."</p>

<p>It also posted several videos and what looks like marketing images showcasing people operating the OnePlus 13T with one hand, and doing their chores with the other (like riding a bike, working on your laptop, etc).</p><p>As for the design, the teaser shows that the phone will sport rounded edges, and an all new squircle rear camera island that houses two lenses and a flash next to it. It sports the volume and the power buttons on one side, and the alleged new shortcut key on on the other side. This could be the first OnePlus that will show up without the alert slider — that will be swapped with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-shortcut-key-alert-slider-replacement-teaser">customizable shortcut button.</a></p>

<p>Talking about the specs of the OnePlus 13T, it will allegedly show up with a 6.31-inch OLED screen with "1.5K" resolution and 120 Hz refresh rate. The phone is said to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>.

<p>OnePlus is finally bringing back its T-series device after three years when the OnePlus 10T launched in 2022. While we aren't sure how much this phone will cost, it is speculated to cost anywhere between the $600-$900 mark.</p><p>The OnePlus 13T is all set to launch on April 24, however, it remains unclear whether the phone will see a global launch this time around.</p>

<p>Google is reportedly working on a few UI changes for its smart home app to make managing it easier.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-ui-changes-matter-apk-teardown-3545210/">Android Authority</a> highlights a few changes the company is working on for the Google Home app. Specifically, these alterations will seemingly impact the Devices and Favorites tabs. An APK teardown shows the Home app could receive a dedicated search icon (magnifying glass) to quickly find saved/favorited connected devices.</p><p>The publication also speculates this would let users easily locate "actions," too.</p><p>On the other hand, the Devices tab is adding another floating button to let users scan the QR codes on smart home products. As the post also notes, this is likely done to improve the experience around setting up Matter-supported devices.</p><p>The Home app's latest version also showcased a slight navigation bar change, which removes the Settings cog wheel. Instead, it seems Google is placing it in your Google Account management menu when tapping your profile icon.</p>

<p>Despite these changes appearing in a teardown, they seem relatively polished. However, it'll likely take a little longer before users see the UI tweaks roll out officially on Android.</p><p>Aside from UI changes, Google has been busy with AI updates for Home, such as the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-help-me-create-public-preview">Help me create</a>" prompt. The company gave Public Preview testers a chance to experiment wth this Gemini-powered feature in December. "Help me create" gave testers an easier way to set up automations for lights, security devices, and more. Users can speak their command to Gemini or write a text description of what the automation should contain.</p><p>The test showed users could get quite descriptive as they fulfill the three parameters Gemini requires: the Starter, Condition, and Action. Of course, this early test was designed to handle any unsightly problems before it rolled out to users.</p><p>The company also held a separate Public Preview test that brought "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-public-preview-gemini-in-assistant-test">Gemini in Assistant</a>" to Nest devices. Gemini's involvement was there to enhance the answers the Assistant delivered to queries. Google said these replies should be more "in-depth" and cover general topics. The test showed users would have the ability to interrupt the Assistant or ask for additional context if they're still unclear.</p>

<p>Ever picked up your phone after a long session of scrolling, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-game-controller-helped-rethink-mobile-gaming-completely">gaming</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-now-lets-you-continue-watching-videos-your-phone-your-pc">watching videos</a> and noticed it's a little… warm? Or maybe even downright hot? You're not alone! It's a common experience, and while it can be a bit alarming, there's always a perfectly logical explanation. Let's dive into why our trusty pocket computers get a little heated.</p>
<p>First things first—some parts inside your phone or tablet are meant to get hot. They can get crazy hot and peel the skin off of you if you touch them. Things like microprocessors typically run upwards of 75 degrees C and can get <em>a lot</em> hotter.</p><p>Those same parts can also be damaged by heat. It's the phone maker's job to pull the extra away and manage everything to keep it cool enough. Some do better than others.</p><p>The next time you hear some phone manufacturing executive telling you about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-turns-off-when-extremely-warm">heat pipes</a>, <strong>this</strong> is what they're talking about.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tRfhAHdHKDbXuLaznYzpmP" name="Pixel-9a-Overheating" alt="The Google Pixel 9a overheating." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tRfhAHdHKDbXuLaznYzpmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some things make your phone run hot. If you are using it for a loooong period, like you're playing a game, things are under load, and that processor gets extra hot. Things like a bad network connection, being in direct sunlight, or sitting in a hot car can also make things extra toasty.</p><p>Charging is a big culprit, too. Charging, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wireless-charging-vs-wired-charging-vs-fast-charging-what-does-actually-mean-efficiency-perspective">fast-charging</a>, creates heat as your battery gets excited. Properly managing this is important, or you might end up with a broken phone or worse.</p>
<p>All this matters. besides getting warm in your hands, heat can degrade the battery, cause the phone's performance to be sluggish due to thermal throttling, or even damage the very same components that are causing the heat.</p><p>Here's the thing — your phone probably never gets hot enough to catch fire or to cause damage to the parts. It may feel too warm to hold, but that's often within normal operating temps and all is fine.</p>
<p>The company that made your phone has to do two things to keep it within the correct operating temperatures: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-jre-teardown">pull away the heat</a> from the chip, and slow the chip down when it gets too hot. In extreme cases, your phone might have to shut off for a while.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3925px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CLNK7aoaz3xbJ8qT8gZRid" name="redmagic-9-pro-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="RedMagic 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CLNK7aoaz3xbJ8qT8gZRid.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3925" height="2208" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since most phones are too thin to have a tiny fan inside (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic-9-pro-review">RedMagic</a> says hello!), the heat needs to be moved away passively. Parts inside need to absorb the heat and "vent" it off, where it won't cause much harm. When it starts to heat up, the processor is forced to slow down until things are back to normal.</p><p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-pro-review">Google Pixel 6 </a>were notorious for throttling because of heat, but while we hated it, it was working as designed. The design simply needed some improvements.</p>
<p>There are a few things you can do if your phone is constantly getting too hot, but really you shouldn't have to do anything if the phone maker did its job. We all know how that plays out sometimes.</p><p>Avoid using it for hours on end, especially doing something like playing games. You might have to stop using your favorite case, or try a different charger. Always keep your phone out of direct sun, like sitting on your cars dash.</p><p>If you noticed things getting hot suddenly, check any new apps you might have installed. Some of them love to keep doing things behind the scenes and using the processor makes it hot.</p><p>If none of this helps, you might have to talk to the company that made your phone and see what it has to say.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-warmth-is-normal-2">A little warmth is normal</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3946px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Yx4YUBUyrWVPHuAZnNuLHX" name="Sensi-Touch-Smart-thermostat-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Sensi Touch Smart Thermostat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yx4YUBUyrWVPHuAZnNuLHX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3946" height="2219" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Remember, a little warmth is perfectly normal. Your phone is a powerful device, and it generates heat as it works. However, if your phone is consistently overheating or becoming uncomfortably hot, it's worth investigating.</p><p>If you're concerned about your phone's temperature, consider contacting your phone's manufacturer or a qualified technician. They can help diagnose any potential issues and ensure your phone stays cool and healthy.</p><p>Hopefully, this helps you understand why your phone sometimes feels a little toasty. Stay cool!</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's Wallet app is having an eventful week as the company details what's new and an important feature that'll catch your eye.</p><p>Google Wallet's developer blog posted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/wallet/docs/release-notes#April_15_2025">the latest changelog</a> this week, which includes a real-time status update addition (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/16/google-wallet-train-status/">9to5Google</a>). Currently rolling out are several status updates for trains. Google clarifies that users will only see these real-time updates if they've saved their ticket to Wallet.</p><p>More importantly, this is only arriving for users in India and Canada for Indian Railways and Via Rail, respectively.</p><p>The patch notes state users will receive alerts on their phones with information like "On Time," "Delayed," and more regarding where their train is. It seems Google Wallet will provide the time your train is expected to arrive at the station when delivering any of these real-time updates.</p><p>Additionally, adding a ticket will show the time you're expected to depart from your station and your estimated time of arrival for your destination.</p>
<h2 id="more-in-store-for-wallet-2">More in store for Wallet</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:391px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:143.48%;"><img id="n5nQyKFy5ChiNQk9fBvSqA" name="google-wallet-train-status-alert" alt="Google Wallet will show real-time train status alerts for users in India and Canada for now." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5nQyKFy5ChiNQk9fBvSqA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="391" height="561" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another noteworthy addition is the ability to add Loyalty and Gift card passes to your Wallet via its homepage on the web. Essentially, this is an integration of Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/wallet/retail/loyalty-cards/use-cases/loyalty-program-enrollment">Loyalty Program</a>. Meanwhile, parents/guardians in "select" countries can now give their child's account permission to add event tickets, generic passes, and more to Wallet. This feature for kids was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-wallet-for-kids-family-link/">originally announced</a> in March, stating those in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Spain, and Poland will receive it first.</p><p>Lastly, the company slipped in a little teaser for its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">I/O 2025</a> event in May. Google says users can expect to "hear about all the changes" coming to Wallet and Pay from May 21 to May 22.</p><p>Google's I/O conference is expected to start on May 20 this year at 10 am PT. We're expecting quite a bit, such as Android 16, Android XR, Wear OS 6, and maybe even teasers for next-gen Pixel products. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">Live Updates</a> are a key aspect expected to arrive in Android 16 this year, which, according to Google, will roll out much earlier in Q2 2025. That release window seems within reach as Android 16 achieved a major milestone: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Platform Stability</a>.</p><p>In short, this means developers are given one final chance to clean up their apps to avoid any conflicts when the upgrade is released. Android 16 Beta also showcased Google's work to improve the accessibility side of its software, as it includes Auracast support for hearing aids.</p>

<ul><li>The April update for the Galaxy S25 series includes enhancements to camera, charging, and software stability.</li><li>A new media widget notification is introduced, allowing for easy media control in the notification shade.</li><li>The update is initially available in Korea, with a global rollout anticipated soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has started rolling out an April update to its flagship Galaxy S25 series this week, and interestingly, it comes mid-way through the month, while older Galaxy phones still await the One UI 7 update in some regions, including India.</p><p>The monthly update is being observed for the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra models (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-ultra-april-2025-update/">SamMobile</a>). The update seems to be live in the Korean region with the <strong>S938NKSU2AYD9</strong> build number. It further includes improvements to the camera, charging, and general software stability. However, the notable change is seen in the media widget notification in the status bar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1473px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.73%;"><img id="78VXEBSWbpW3HiF9bMpFqC" name="Galaxy-S25-media-playback-Now-Bar-widget" alt="Galaxy S25 series media playback widget" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78VXEBSWbpW3HiF9bMpFqC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1473" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SamMobile)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung introduced the Now Bar pill for certain apps with One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25 series, which can be quickly glanced at on the lock screen alongside the status bar. The latest update will be introducing media widget notification for the Galaxy S25 series, which for some reason has been missing on the flagship trio, notes SamMobile — while it was added for older Galaxy phones that received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> update recently.</p><p>The new pill-shaped media play button will reside in the notification shade right beside the time on the Galaxy S25 series. Alternatively, it can also be seen in the notifications pane. When the live widget in the status bar is clicked, more prominent play controls pop up for easy control on the home screen.</p>

<p>While the latest update is currently confined to the Korean region, a wider rollout is expected soon. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 series in the region is recommended to navigate to their phone <em><strong>Settings> Software update> and click Download and Install</strong></em> to check for the latest update.</p><p>On the other hand, the much-anticipated One UI 7 update for older devices like the Galaxy S24 series in some regions seems to have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/serious-bug-pushes-samsung-to-stall-one-ui-7-rollout-globally">pulled from servers</a> as the firmware notably had a serious bug. The initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">rollout began</a> on April 7 in Korea, followed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/stable-one-ui-7-rolls-out-to-users-both-in-the-us-and-european-regions">U.S. and U.K</a>., however, other major markets like India have still been left out at the moment.</p>

<hr>
<p>Honor is giving consumers a glimpse into what its strengthened partnership with Google Cloud will bring to the table.</p><p>In a press release, Honor highlighted a trio of major AI features inbound for its device during Google Cloud Next 2025. The company states its "close collaboration" with Google will foster the continuation of on-device and cloud-based AI features. To that end, Honor's Eric Fang, senior director of product planning, teased planned product and productivity features.</p><p>Fang states Honor's upcoming products, which are looking at a May 2025 release, will contain features that leverage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-veo-2-becomes-widely-available-as-it-teases-gemini-2-5-flash">Google's Veo</a> video generation tech. The Chinese OEM has "co-developed experiences" to help facilitate better motion on its generated content and "enhanced realism." Meanwhile, Fang teased "advanced office tools" for consumers interested in Honor's next products in May with Gemini.</p><p>For the busy-bees, Honor says its newest features should help streamline workflows and provide users with intelligent assistance daily.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:750px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.00%;"><img id="WQts25oz7RASzN8RN2ZkfD" name="honor-google-cloud-next-2025-press-photo" alt="Honor announced a closer partnership with Google Cloud during a Next 2025 speech." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQts25oz7RASzN8RN2ZkfD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="750" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor then drew attention to a couple of AI features co-developed with Google Cloud called AI Outpainting and AI Eraser. The former redefined post-processing function that leverages Google's Imagen software, so users can expand a photo up to "twice their original size." The feature appears alongside Honor's AiMAGE Suite, letting users "reframe and rotate" pictures after snapping.</p><p>The feature's goal is help users worry less about perfecting framing their shots. Fang adds, "The optimized generative fill ensures the expanded images are seamlessly integrated, even in complex scenes like buildings and landscapes."</p><p>Elsewhere, Honor reiterates AI Eraser — which many Pixel owners will recognize. This function erases unwanted content from photos while leveraging on-device AI software to "realistically" fill in the gap with content that fits. These two AI features, alongside AI Upscale, rolled out with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/the-honor-400-lite-5g-is-iphone-copying-gone-too-far">Honor 400 Lite</a> in Europe earlier in April. Fang states this is all a part of Honor's plan to "democratize" its AI, which aims to bring the software to even more users, including its midrange devices.</p>

<p>Honor set down a more AI-focused path for its devices earlier this year when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-alpha-plan-mwc-2025-tease">teased what users would see</a> at MWC 2025. Promptly in March, the OEM revealed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Alpha Plan</a>, a three-step strategy centered around intelligent phones. That's not all, as Honor also honed in on an AI ecosystem and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) to "open human potential boundaries and co-create a new paradigm for civilization."</p><p>Its announcement during MWC 2025 brought our initial glimpse of its AiMAGE Suite. Honor stated the suite piggybacks off an AI kernel to run device-cloud AI software for the sake of enhancing the clarity of photos. Through its partnership with Google Cloud and Qualcomm Technologies, Honor is positioning itself to introduce AI features that can reserve restaurant tables for its consumers through third-party sources.</p><p>Honor informed users that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honors-latest-ai-features-want-to-fight-deep-fake-videos-and-eye-strain">DeepFake Detection software</a> would make its way to flagship models and foldables in international markets.</p>

While this leak doesn't talk much about the base and Pro variants, it suggests that the Pixel 10 Pro XL could see a $100 price increase, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could see a $300 reduction in price.</p><p>With every flagship device, Google tries to improve its features and overall experience with its premium phones. These advancements would require the company to invest more in Research and Development (R&D), marketing, etc, which could impact the whole pricing game. Before we get into that, it's helpful to understand Google's pricing strategy over the years.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-s-pricing-trends-over-the-years-2">Google Pixel's pricing trends over the years</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZqxAdJriP3PzU3PbjVMbzK" name="Google-Pixel-pricing-history" alt="Google Pixel Prices over the years" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZqxAdJriP3PzU3PbjVMbzK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/6096/google-smartphone-prices/">Statista</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Historically, the first-gen base Google Pixel was priced at $649, and the company bumped the price of the device two years later when it released the Pixel 3 at $799, the reason being that the Pixel 3 got an upgraded processor, dual front cameras, wireless charging, and more.</p><p>Later, Google shifted its strategy and decreased the cost of its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-5-looks-back-basics-model-we-can-get-excited-about"> Pixel 5</a>, to $699—$100 less than its previous model. This phone was released during the pandemic, a time when consumers were very reluctant to buy a new device due to economic uncertainty. Google felt that a lower price point could favor the tech giant over other players in the market.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I don’t think there are any special considerations or features that Pixel or any other phone maker needs to make to justify any added costs that come from tariffs.</p><figcaption><cite>Jitesh Ubrani</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>The next two generations of the base model also saw a 100$ dip in pricing, after that, it picked up with the Pixel 8 which costs $699, while the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9 </a>now sits at $799 with a $100 price hike.</p><p>According to Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, companies don't need to justify why they increase pricing, which comes with added tariffs or manufacturing.</p><p>"Many companies have already gone on record stating that tariffs are going to lead to price increases and Google won’t be treated any differently," he explained. However, it's important to note that as of now, Trump has recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">exempted</a> electronics from any reciprocal tariffs.</p>

<p>When you look at the Pro model's pricing it has remained consistent over the past few generations. Initially, Google used the "XL" term variant, and later with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-6-first-phone-im-excited-about-long-time">Pixel 6</a>, the variant was rebranded as the "Pro" model.</p><p>By maintaining a consistent price point, the company wanted to make premium features more accessible, pushing for wider adoption. It also allowed Google to keep up with competition, giving consumers more predictability, which made it easier for them to decide on buying a phone even before launch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5qjmyvhuj5Y9BbVDENCrpE" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-7.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL in tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5qjmyvhuj5Y9BbVDENCrpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, Google wanted to do something different with the Pixel 9 series. To remain relevant and on par with its competitors, it launched three distinct models — it added the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro </a>to the lineup, bringing a smaller version of the Pro XL.</p><p>While the only difference between the above two variants could be the size, Ubrani adds that "the customer segment between the Pro and Pro XL likely has a lot of overlap to begin with."</p><p>Further explaining that the Pixel 10 Pro XL might see a 100$ hike in price, Ubrani notes that this could likely be because the variant is produced in smaller quantities, the company could be trying to make up for the higher production costs with the increased pricing.</p>
<h2 id="price-hike-and-its-impact-on-consumers-2">Price hike and its impact on consumers</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7TBXngN82WckdZx2MEU2ZJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="Android Central's best of 2024 phone and accessories selection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TBXngN82WckdZx2MEU2ZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When a company announces a price increase, generally, consumers will likely weigh the pros and cons before spending on the new device, comparing whether the features and specs offered are worth the extra expense or not. And whether they feel that a $100 price increase on the Pixel 10 Pro XL is justified,  just for its larger size.</p><p>However, Ubrani notes that shifts in pricing don't depend only on one feature, but it's more of an overall experience that dictates the increase in prices, and despite fluctuations in smartphone prices, a significant number of users wouldn't notice or care about it. This is due to the dominance of financing and or trade-in offers, which lessen the blow to their pockets brought by the rising costs of these devices.</p><p>Ubrani elaborates that shifts in consumer mindset have been driving these price increases. "Over the past few years, we have seen an influx of buy now, pay later schemes or trade-in offers, which have made it easier for the consumer to digest the increase in phone prices."</p><p>Moreover, in an unstable economic climate brought in by the tariffs or other geopolitical factors, Google "can easily shift blame away from itself and towards the political uncertainties," he added.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>This is perhaps the most interesting rumor right now about Pixel pricing. By lowering prices on the fold, Google can perhaps kickstart adoption.</p><figcaption><cite>Jitesh Ubrani</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>Along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, came a premium foldable—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on"> Pixel 9 Pro Fold </a>which costs around $1,799, which seems reasonable since foldables <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-10-fold-price-just-leaked-and-it-could-be-a-tipping-point-for-foldable-phones">typically</a> sit between $1,600 - $1,800 and can go upwards of $2,000 or more based on storage configurations.</p><p>Per the recent rumor, Google could allegedly drop the price of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to $1,600. Such a move could be industry-changing as these top-tier devices are typically quite expensive. Ubrani feels that lowering the price point of the fold could help Google kickstart the adoption of this device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.00%;"><img id="qyZ8vKm3vXNMGK4A5T7mee" name="Foldables-market-2024-25" alt="Line graph indicating foldable sales in 2024-25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qyZ8vKm3vXNMGK4A5T7mee.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1400" height="868" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Counterpoint)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"It may also help Google push up their average selling prices across the lineup a bit further, and assuming the design stays the same as the previous version, then Google can pass off some of the savings in R&D to end users," Ubrani added.</p><p>If one major company like Google makes this move, it could trigger other top players in the foldable scene like Samsung, OnePlus, and Huawei to decrease the cost of their foldables as well. This price adjustment could help improve the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/press-release/foldable-smartphone-market-stalls-in-2024-and-2025">already slumping foldable market</a>.</p><p>But it remains to be seen if Google will end up reducing the cost of its foldable just so it can increase its footprint in the foldable market. However, this is still a rumor, and whether or not the tech giant could go ahead with this will ultimately depend on other factors like manufacturing costs, competitive pricing, and overall market strategy.</p>

<p>I'm a little late in the game, but I finally got my hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</a> in late March so I could do some additional testing. I enjoy camera deep dives and display analysis for Android Central Labs, and while I fully expected this to be a run-of-the-mill Samsung release, the display really surprised me.</p><p>But it's not the color accuracy or some other "normal" display metric that impressed me. It's the High Brightness Mode (HBM). This special mode exists on all modern phones and typically turns on when the automatic brightness sensor detects something as bright as sunlight. But the Galaxy S24 FE's does something different from every other Samsung phone I've tested: it switches to DC dimming, unlocking the full brightness potential of the display.</p><p>Typically, all Samsung Galaxy phones with AMOLED screens use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> at all brightness levels, withholding the display's true maximum brightness level. Not only that, but PWM dimming makes people like me feel awful within just a few minutes, hurting my eyes and giving me a headache. That gives the S24 FE's HBM a unique advantage that other Samsung phones don't have, and it makes me wonder why Samsung doesn't use it more often.</p>

<h2 id="forcing-high-brightness-mode-2">Forcing high brightness mode</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Pm79vSpXru3MMvSWMutBq3" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-galaxy-s24-ultra-galaxy-s25-ultra-displays" alt="A Samsung Galaxy 24 FE, S24 Ultra, and S25 Ultra in the sun with High Brightness Mode enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pm79vSpXru3MMvSWMutBq3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My normal display testing procedure involves a light meter to determine brightness levels and flickering potential, a microscope to see the subpixel arrangement and if the display dithers, and a flashlight to force High Brightness Mode so I can separately measure how a display behaves in the sun.</p><p>It was during this flashlight test — where I turn on the torch on a smartphone and hold it near the top of the display — where I found the S24 FE's special mode kick in. Theoretically, we could make Samsung flagships more eye-friendly by forcing High Brightness Mode on all the time and then using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.rewhex.screendimmer">a screen dimmer app</a> to reduce the brightness a different way, but we have to figure out how to force HBM all the time in the first place.</p><p>I checked all my usual sources on Reddit, Telegram, and even among other groups of tech journalists and no one seemed to know how other than what I had already done. It's not exactly viable to walk around holding a flashlight up to your phone, so there had to be another way.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H4ucpWXwIzM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<figure><blockquote><p>High Brightness Mode is something that only kicks in when a bright light source (like the sun) is shining on the display.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Searching the Google Play Store for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=force%20high%20brightness%20mode&c=apps">apps that do the job</a> returns lots of results. I spent money on several apps but none of them worked. Google has changed a lot on the backend of Android in recent years and system-level functions like HBM aren't typically accessible to apps without root access, so this was a dead-end.</p><p>So I turned to ADB, the command line solution for all your Android modification needs. I dialed down into /sys/class/backlight/panel and found the max_brightness setting I was looking for. You can force HBM on some Android phones by using a command like "echo 1 >> /sys/class/backlight/panel/max_brightness" to change this setting to 1, which means "enabled."</p><p>Unfortunately, I got a "permission denied" response, which meant I had to have root access to do this. Rooting a Samsung phone is bad news, as it trips Knox security and requires all kinds of tomfoolery to get things working properly again so, yet again, this was a dead-end.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>High Brightness Mode often doubles the display's peak brightness, unleashing its full potential.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>So then I got more desperate. What could possibly trick a sensor into thinking it's in the sun? I tried applying a piece of foil to the screen, but that didn't work. Light sensors are passive acceptors of light, not producers, but I hoped the foil would cause some kind of loop by reflecting the display and causing it to think it was under brighter lighting conditions. Oh well.</p><p>Maybe taping an LED to the screen and covering it would work? Sure, this was a potential solution but it not only requires some kind of external power supply for the LED, but it's obviously not a full-time solution as it's both bulky and trashy looking.</p><p>No, the only real solution is for Samsung to allow users to enable High Brightness Mode manually, something we'd have to petition en-masse to achieve.</p>
<h2 id="high-brightness-full-potential-2">High brightness, full potential</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DYRStxqKGJHqHJ9LaccASf" name="s24-fe-s24-ultra-s25-ultra-HBM" alt="Comparing High Brightness Mode brightness dips between the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, S24 Ultra, and S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DYRStxqKGJHqHJ9LaccASf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE's high brightness mode is the only AMOLED-powered Samsung Galaxy phone I have in my posession that switches away from PWM dimming to DC dimming. If you're not familiar with PWM dimming, here's the quick gist.</p><p>AMOLED has the ability to quickly turn on and off its pixels, delivering better motion resolution with little to no ghosting, unlike some LCD panels. But AMOLED also has a problem: reducing voltage can sometimes introduce lower color accuracy and random noise patterns. Engineers have cleverly borrowed pulse width modulation (PWM) from other types of electronics — like fans and pumps — which turns the voltage off and on to "regulate" the amount sent to the component.</p><p>On the display side, this essentially turns your phone's display into a strobe light. Normally, you can't see this strobing because it's done so quickly. Instead, your eyes perceive the display as brighter or dimmer depending on how long the display stays off during this flickering behavior.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xPRhavT5H37Zw7aSuG5oKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-brightness-comparison" alt="Comparing maximum brightness modes on the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, including PWM rates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xPRhavT5H37Zw7aSuG5oKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But while this behavior ensures better color accuracy and smoother details in some circumstances, it also introduces <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">negative health effects</a> and artificially limits the maximum brightness of your phone's display. Flagship Samsung phones like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra never reach their actual maximum brightness potential because they use PWM dimming at all times, even during high brightness mode.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>DC-like dimming doesn't just unlock the display's full brightness potential, it also makes it more eye-friendly for people sensitive to flickering.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>You can see this illustrated in the image above. On the left side, you'll see what Samsung calls "100% brightness" with the "extra brightness" option enabled. It's pretty obvious the display isn't actually outputting "100%" brightness as the thick black lines detected with a 1/6400 camera shutter speed show how long the display stays off during the PWM dimming cycle. Clearly, "100%" in this case is an arbitrary number crafted by Samsung rather than the actual maximum output of the display.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 FE on the right is using High Brightness Mode, triggered by me holding a flashlight up to the top of the display for a few seconds. This recreates sunlight conditions and kicks the display up to its <em>actual</em> maximum brightness which, based on my measurements, is <strong>double the brightness level</strong> of "100%" brightness.</p><p>During this special high brightness mode, the display stays on most of the time and doesn't use the harsh PWM flickering cycle it typically uses at all other brightness levels. This dimming method is known as "DC-like" dimming on OLEDs because it more closely follows how a traditional lightbulb or LCD dims itself, which is substantially more eye-friendly than the artificial methods Samsung typically employs.</p>

<p>It's actually quite surprising that Samsung doesn't give users full access to the different brightness modes available, including different dimming options, given the company's penchant for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/good-lock-one-ui-7-update-is-great">letting users fully customize</a> their phones.</p><p>Instead, Samsung continues to limit its displays in bizarre ways. Not only do you only have access to about half the potential brightness of your display — or less on the Ultra models — but you're forced to use harmful low-Hz PWM dimming on most Samsung phones.</p><p>Samsung, it's time to give users the full range of choices they want on their displays. That "extra brightness" setting should mean enabling High Brightness Mode, not some arbitrary number you come up with. Users should be allowed to choose the dimming method that works for them, not just the one you decide on an arbitrary basis. Samsung devices are commonly about being everything to everybody, and it's time Samsung delivers on that promise with its displays.</p>

<p>I got the USB-C version of the AirPods Max, and I was excited about plugging these into my gaming machine and using them as my daily driver. However, that wasn't possible as they wouldn't connect via USB-C — until now. Apple has started delivering the update to unlock 24-bit/48 kHz lossless audio via USB-C (you'll need to update to build 7E101), and it makes the AirPods Max so much better.</p><p>Now that I'm finally able to connect the headset to Windows, I wanted to see how good they actually are, so I paired the AirPods Max against my audio setup, which includes an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze MM-500</a> that's hooked up to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19 DAC</a>. Although the MM-500 are aimed at mastering, they have a vibrant sound that lends itself well to gaming and casual listening, and I've been using the headphones for over a year. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-MM-500-Professional-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B0B837YJSY">MM-500 retailing for $1,699</a> and the Fiio K19 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-K19-ES9039SPRO-Desktop-31-Band/dp/B0D1Y6M3W6">coming in at $1,364</a>, the two products cost more than six times as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJC52FP">$479 AirPods Max</a>. <br><br>As is the case with all Apple products, the AirPods Max have tight integration with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone</a>, iPad, and macOS devices. While there's no mention of Windows, I was able to connect the headphones to my Windows 11 gaming machine without any issues via the provided USB-C to USB-C cable. Windows detected the AirPods Max as headphones, and I was able to use the 24-bit/48 kHz mode to take full advantage of the audio potential.</p>

<p>I immediately put the AirPods Max to the test, launching Roon and listening to some of my favorite albums. The headphones held up better than I imagined, and were thoroughly enjoyable to use. That said, they didn't quite measure up to the open-backed MM-500; Audeze's headphones delivered a significantly cleaner sound with a rumbling low-end, crystal-clear mids, and detailed treble. The Max have a good low-end, but the recessed mids makes vocals sound a tad artificial, and you don't get the same engaging soundstage.</p>

<p>That was always going to be the case considering the use case of either headset, and even $349 closed-back products like the Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro sound much better. But where AirPods Max win out is the sheer versatility; they can be used in a wide variety of settings that just isn't feasible with the MM-500 or the DT 1770 Pro.</p>

<p>The MM-500 has been sitting on my desk this past year, while I took the AirPods Max with me on flights, paired it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> and used it to watch movies and TV shows, and used it while working out. The biggest bonus is the ANC; the AirPods Max have the best noise isolation of any headphones I used, and that's immediately evident even from switching from the Sony WH-1000XM5. <br><br>While they are heavier than most Bluetooth headphones, they don't have anywhere close to the same heft as the MM-500, and the mesh headband does a great job distributing the weight while providing good ventilation. They also have a cleaner design, and the blue variant I'm using looks pretty stylish. They also have just the right amount of clamping force, and don't exert too much pressure — a key consideration for prolonged use.</p>

<p>What I like the most about the lossless audio update is that I can plug in the AirPods Max to my iPad Pro; I dabble in music production, and the ability to plug in the headset is highly convenient. Don't get me wrong; they did a decent enough job over Bluetooth, but they sound better when plugged in, and there's no latency whatsoever. <br><br>If anything, my main issue with the AirPods Max is the case; it does little to safeguard the mesh headband, and I constantly worry about it getting damaged whilst in my bag (though not so much to actually buy a hard shell case). Outside of that, the AirPods Max have been fantastic in daily use, and the ability to plug them to my Windows machine and use lossless audio makes these a standout choice.</p>

<ul><li>Identity Check was spotted on a OnePlus 13 running the Android 16 beta.</li><li>The feature is expected to arrive on more Android phones with the Android 16 update coming later this year.</li><li>It requires a change to Android's biometric prompt code, which can't be completed without a full update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Identity Check is a useful Android feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your devices when they're outside of trusted location, and there's a chance it could arrive on more supported phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. As of now, Identity Check only works on select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy devices.</p><p>However, it was recently spotted on a OnePlus 13 running the Android 16 beta, hinting that Identity Check will be more widely available soon (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-identity-check-3544525/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). After upgrading to Android 16, the Identity Check option became available in the <strong>Settings > Google > Theft Protection</strong>, where features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock</a> are also found on supported devices.</p><p>When enabled, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-enable-identity-check">Identity Check</a> requires biometric authentication to view or modify certain sensitive parts on your Android smartphone. A fingerprint or face unlock is required for the following actions when your device is outside of a trusted location:</p>
<ul><li>Accessing saved passkeys and app passwords</li><li>Changing PIN, pattern, or password, and turning off Find My</li></ul>
<p>For these actions, biometric authentication is mandatory outside of trusted locations with Identity Check enabled — a password, PIN, or pattern won't work as an alternative. This is intended to prevent people from hijacking your Google account or other online accounts in the event your phone is lost or stolen, even if the bad actor knows your password.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="5yuQ8rnGKn9nvTuvdqmggH" name="Android-16-logo-orange-oneplus-13-01" alt="An orange and blue Android 16 logo on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5yuQ8rnGKn9nvTuvdqmggH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android expert Mishaal Rahman reports that the delay in bringing Identity Check to other Android phones is because the feature requires a full OS upgrade. This is because Identity Check eliminates the PIN/password/pattern fallback, which is part of biometric prompt code that can't be changed with a basic update. As such, other Android phones can receive Identity Check by upgrading to Android 16 or with a manual upgrade.</p><p>For instance, Samsung added Identity Check with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, which released later than most manufacturers' Android 15-based upgrades. Google added it with Android 15 QPR1 for Pixel phones. All other Android manufacturers can create an update with Identity Check, now fully supported in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-3-1-rolls-out-ahead-of-expected-december-launch">Android 15 QPR1</a>, or simply wait for Android 16 to roll out.</p><p>Since the Android 16 upgrade will automatically include Identity Check, this is how most users of Android phones that aren't a Pixel or Galaxy will likely get the feature. It isn't expected to be enabled by default, and will support any phone with class three biometric hardware.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Honor launched the 400 Lite 5G in a few markets already, and it's arriving in the U.K. and Europe next week. When it does, buyers will soon realize that the Honor 400 Lite 5G is an attempt at creating a carbon copy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro</a> at a fraction of the price, down to the dedicated camera button and unmistakable rear camera housing.</p><p>While certain Android phones try to copy the iPhone all the time, this is arguably the most egregious example we've ever seen.</p><p>The idea companies of "copying" or "stealing" designs or features isn't always a problem. If brands notice what is working for their competitors, borrowing what works and ditching what doesn't, the entire market grows.</p><p>For instance, multiple Android brands upped their software support guarantee after Google's seven-year promise debuted. Samsung and OnePlus borrowed Apple's titanium frame idea for some of their handsets. In the end, it's a good thing. Now, people have phones that will run newer Android versions longer and are made out of strong and light materials.</p><p>It's not like Apple doesn't steal features from Android phones, either — Live Voicemail in iOS is a direct ripoff of Pixel's Call Screen, and Offline Maps just came to iOS recently despite being available on Android since 2012.</p><p>With that being said, it's hard not to look at the design of the Honor Magic 400 Lite 5G and cringe. There's something about this particular iPhone lookalike that feels shameless, and it has me wondering why Android brands don't try to find their own identity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.93%;"><img id="ZpKXyJJxd9UA45vhuavVQC" name="Honor-400-Lite-" alt="The Honor 400 Lite 5G in a press photo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpKXyJJxd9UA45vhuavVQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1109" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few things about the Honor 400 Lite 5G that feel particularly corny, but the biggest one is the rear camera housing. It has an almost-identical shape to the one you'll find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-iphone-16-pro">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max, minus Honor's triangular accents. Aside from the fact that the cameras are clearly positioned to mimic the iPhone camera layout, the real problem here is the 400 Lite 5G's flash.</p><p>That's right — if you look closely, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-honor-phones">Honor</a> 400 Lite 5G is using a dual-camera system. It appears to be intended to look like a triple-camera layout from afar, just like the iPhone 16 Pro. But in reality the third "lens" is just the flash. It's hard to think of a reason to design the flash in this way unless the goal was to make the 400 Lite 5G look more premium than it actually is.</p><p>Then, there's the camera button, which is an obvious Camera Control ripoff. On its own, Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">borrowing the Camera Control button isn't a horrible move</a>. Like the Action button, the Camera Control button is one iPhone feature I think more Android phones should copy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pMexFshkZtjCt7RQHyvto4" name="iphone-16-pro-max-10.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Control button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pMexFshkZtjCt7RQHyvto4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's the <em>way</em> Honor implemented the dedicated camera button that makes the 400 Lite 5G feel like a cheap knockoff. The button appears to be placed in the exact same place as the iPhone 16 Pro equivalent, and is similarly recessed. This is all true despite the fact that iPhone 16 Pro users — including myself — seem to agree that the Camera Control button is poorly placed. Honor could've improved on this button, and instead it merely copied it.</p><p>It doesn't help that Honor is calling the AI Camera Button "innovative" and "unique" in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250411857642/en/HONOR-400-Lite-5G-Launches-with-108MP-AI-Camera-and-Unique-AI-Camera-Button" target="_blank">press release</a>, which sounds borderline insulting to potential buyers who know they've seen this exact thing before on the iPhone. Even the incorporation of AI and Google Lens matches up with Visual Intelligence on an iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>Android Central reached out to both Honor and Apple for comment but did not immediately hear back. We will update this article with more information.</p>
<h2 id="honor-s-400-lite-5g-takes-a-step-backward-2">Honor's 400 Lite 5G takes a step backward</h2>
<p>Put simply, this is a regression for the Honor 400 Lite 5G. The overall design, camera arrangement, Dynamic Island-like camera cutout, and AI Camera Button all feel shamelessly <em>inspired</em> by the iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>The new design of the Honor 400 Lite 5G is worse when you consider what we lost — a unique design of Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget and midrange phones</a>. Compared to both the Honor 300 series and the Honor 200 Lite that this phone replaces, I much prefer the older models.</p>

<p>Instead, we have yet another iPhone lookalike. While I commend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones">Honor</a> for being the first Android manufacturer to incorporate a Camera Control-esque button on their smartphone, it should've done so without sacrificing its uniqueness.</p>

<hr>
<p>New reports pile on the in-house chip rumors for Xiaomi as the company allegedly makes a big move to secure that future.</p><p>The report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/845/431.htm">ITHome</a> (Chinese) cites supposed sources that claim Xiaomi has "internally" announced the start of a "chip platform department"(via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/04/15/xiaomi-establishes-dedicated-chip-platform-department-to-advance-its-in-house-chip-ambitions/">Gizmochina</a>). The OEM is looking to reduce its reliance on outside sources for chips for its future devices. As such, Xiaomi allegedly tapped Qin Muyun, with history as Qualcomm's former senior director of product marketing to lead the department.</p><p>There isn't much left to chew through as Xiaomi hasn't announced the existence of its chip platform department officially to the public.</p><p>Reports add Qin Muyun will report to Xiaomi's Li Jun, the general manager of its product department.</p><p>The post by Gizmochina reiterates recent leaks about Xiaomi's first alleged in-house chip, which could pack flagship specs — at least in one area. The publication claims the chip could feature a Cortex X925 core at 3.2GHz, which is the same one found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400 SoC</a>. The other cores are rumored to come from a past-generation, leading some to believe Xiaomi may skip its flagships with its first chip.</p>

<p>Reports about Xiaomi's growing interest in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-pursues-in-house-developed-phone-chip-report">manufacturing in-house chips</a> surfaced in November. The Chinese OEM's close relationship with Qualcomm was highlighted; however, Xiaomi is more interested in becoming "self-sufficient" instead. MediaTek is another company Xiaomi would like to cut back from. While the company has actively worked with Qualcomm for SoCs, it states it's implemented additions atop the brand's chips for its consumers.</p><p>One such addition involved upgrades to improve power management capabilities and "graphic enhancements."</p><p>This was a long-time aspiration for Xiaomi's Chairman and CEO Lei Jun, who stated in October the company would invest roughly 30 billion yuan (~$4.1 billion) in 2025 for in-house chips. Rumors state could enter mass production sometime this year.</p><p>Xiaomi also faces the possibility of leaning on TSMC, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-made-by-tsmc-in-the-works">like Google's did</a> when it broke away from Samsung. The true power of Xiaomi's future custom chip is unknown. Moreover, where we could see it first appear is unclear, though it may happen in late 2025 if not 2026.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Update April 18, 2025: </strong>After publishing this article, Google representatives reached out to me for further troubleshooting. They found that "the issue was caused by having simultaneous subscriptions on the YouTube side," a problem the company is aware of. Google says that Gemini and Google One trails do not include YouTube Premium at all, so the trial I accepted for Gemini Advanced is separate from the problem I had on YouTube. The original article is as follows:</p>
<hr>
<p>For the last six months, my YouTube Music account has been broken. If my wife and I ever wanted to listen to music at the same time, I'd either have to take my phone offline completely, or one of us just wouldn't listen to music at all. This isn't the first time it has happened either, but if I have anything to say about it, it'll be the last.</p><p>It all started back in November when I somehow accepted a free trial to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> advanced programs. This particular one included a YouTube Premium subscription as part of its model, which Google believes will help incentivize users to pay a little extra to get a lot of value. The problem is that I already had a YouTube Premium family subscription.</p><p>Worse yet, even some YouTube <em>videos</em> would cause my account to error out like this, making it beyond irritating to try to play the music I was paying for. Google was powerless to fix it because of one reason or another, ensuring my winter was filled with Silent Nights in more than one way until that blasted trial ended <em><strong>six months later</strong></em>.</p>
<h2 id="falling-on-deaf-ears-2">Falling on deaf ears</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N5NeCiKTvsaGz6X4UWB5jf" name="youtube-music-premium-trial-overlap" alt="Overlapping YouTube Premium and trial accounts in the YouTube Music app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N5NeCiKTvsaGz6X4UWB5jf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At first, it took me a while to figure out what happened. Out of nowhere, I started getting these "playback paused because your account is being used in another location" errors in YouTube Music. That can't be possible, I thought; I have a family plan and nowhere near the maximum number of people on it!</p><p>Simultaneously, I also noticed a new "upgrade" button in the bottom right corner of my YouTube Music app. I assumed maybe it was a ploy by Google to get me to subscribe to one of its more expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> plans or something similar, but it turns out this button appeared because <em>my account</em> had been flagged as a trial account.</p><p>Of course, this made no sense. I already had a family premium account, as evidenced by the photo above, yet a second trial was stacked on top and marked as the primary subscription for the account. So I did what any good paying customer would do: I asked for the manager.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="osyVGRPvc4ZtTqJPCaAXnf" name="youtube-music-premium-trial-upgrade-02" alt="An upgrade button on the bottom of the YouTube Music app that's only present when a trial is active on an account" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osyVGRPvc4ZtTqJPCaAXnf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube Music support ran me through some steps I was hopeful would work. I was directed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/9056360?sjid=11775026802180788269-NC">cancel my paid Google One plan</a> and let the trial take precedence, offloading the subscription cost from my budget for a while. That sounded great, but it didn't work.</p><p>Next, they had me <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://one.google.com/settings">disable family sharing</a> on my Google One account to see if that would trigger a system-side permissions dialog or something similar, assuming that the problem was first caused by the trial not including family plan permissions. No dice. Even re-enabling family sharing didn't fix it.</p><p>At this point, support identified the stacked trial account as the underlying problem but said there's nothing they could do about it. Apparently, Google support doesn't have the power to alter subscriptions or cancel trials; only the user can.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google was powerless to fix the problem I had accidentally made by accepting a free trial, and that's unacceptable.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But the biggest problem, of course, is that <em>there's no way to cancel a trial</em> once it has begun. Again, YouTube support confirmed this awful design, and my press contacts later confirmed it. The only thing I could do was wait until April 11, and I had 5 months to go by the time this was fully figured out.</p><p>So here I am on the other side of April 11, <strong>confirming</strong> that this was, in fact, the issue the entire time. Over the last three days, my wife and I have purposefully tested out all sorts of ways to play back music on multiple devices, and we never received a playback error. Everything worked as it should! Huzzah!</p><p>The moral of the story is this: watch out when you accept a free trial. Sometimes, a free trial can make you aware of some amazing value you didn't know existed, or even get you linked up with a service you can't wait to pay for. Other times, it might just ruin your day and keep it ruined for months. While I probably thought a trial would save me some money for a few months, it ended up being more of a headache than it was worth.</p>

This meant that your search results came from <em>google.ng</em> if you were in Nigeria, for example. This allowed the company to curate its results better to (hopefully) ensure they were more relevant.</p>
<p>Google has been working on ways to improve this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/making-search-results-more-local-and-relevant/" target="_blank">since 2017</a>, and it thinks it has reached the point where ccTLD redirects are no longer needed and all searches are in the process of being "un-re-directed" back to plain old google.com.</p><p>The company says you might need to re-enter some of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-quick-settings-web-redesign">search preferences</a> once this happens for you, but promises that the results will be the same as you're used to seeing. The difference is what's going on up in the browser's address bar.</p>

<p>Yep, this is dry, boring news that most people either don't care about or just don't understand. But it does tell me one thing — hiding the full web address in your browser's bar — something I have hated seeing since it started being a thing — was probably the right call. It seems that the geniuses at tech companies are once again smarter than Jerry is.</p><p>Case in point: I, and plenty of other <del>paranoid</del> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-security">security-conscious</a> people like me, have long told you that it's very important to check the URL of any website you've visited to make sure it is legit. Seeing google.co.kr (South Korea) or google.co.br (Brazil) would be an immediate red flag to someone who isn't super tech savvy, but knew why they needed to make sure they were at the right place. You went to Google and searched for something, so you would assume that the results would come from Google, not "Google.something else."</p>

<p>This is a trap a lot of people writing about tech, as well as people who understand how it works, can fall into. It's easy to assume that anyone would know why this is happening and that it was OK, and that's just wrong. Plenty of well-adjusted "normal" people do not care about this kind of thing. They use their phone or laptop because they enjoy it, never caring to go any deeper.</p><p>When a company like Apple or Google does something to dumb down the tech experience, they are not thinking about people who write for a tech publication or people who regularly read them. They are thinking about the vast majority of people who have no interest in how the fudge is made.</p><p>I'm still going to hate it every time, and you probably will, too. But companies like Google won't care. Maybe they shouldn't after all.</p>

<ul><li>Google is moving to the google.com domain for Search around the world.</li><li>Previously, Google used country-coded domains for regions outside the U.S.</li><li>The experience of using Google Search won't change, as Google has been using physical location to localize Search since 2017.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has long used country-coded domains for non-U.S. regions, like google.co.uk for the United Kingdom or google.ng for Nigeria. For a while, these country-specific URLs were crucial in providing locally-relevant results in response to user queries.</p><p>However, since 2017, Google has been using your real-time location to provide relevant results — making the country codes redundant. As such, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/country-code-top-level-domains/" target="_blank">announced</a> today, April 15 that it is phasing out country code top-level domain names (ccTLD).</p><p>Beginning now, Google will be moving country-specific <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-app-android-ai-mode-search-bar-test">Search</a> domains to the main google.com URL. The process will be part of a gradual rollout lasting "over the coming months."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="H668jKUNrYyRWCJvQL4z3D" name="google-SGE-hero.jpg" alt="Google generative AI in Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H668jKUNrYyRWCJvQL4z3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The change is intended to streamline the experience of using Google Search regardless of your country or location, per the company. Search itself isn't changing, but as part of the switch, users may have to enter some of their preferences again for the new domain.</p><p>As has been the case since 2017, Google will use your physical location to localize your search results. For instance, if you're living in the U.S., you will get the Search experience for France if you travel to Paris. When you go back, you'll automatically be switched to the U.S. experience again.</p><p>"It’s important to note that while this update will change what people see in their browser address bar, it won’t affect the way Search works, nor will it change how we handle obligations under national laws," the company said in the blog post.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus only just launched its Watch 3 in the U.S., and now it appears it'll waste no time launching a smaller model based on the Oppo Watch X2 Mini.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-watch-43mm-fcc-certification/">91Mobiles</a> spotted an FCC certification for a 43mm OnePlus Watch with the model number OPWE242. It measures 48.03 x 43.14mm, which is taller but slimmer than the 46.6 x 47.6mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, and will have a 345mAh capacity. The FCC figures also show the rotating crown.</p><p>The Oppo Watch X2 Mini was announced last week with the exact same 345mAh capacity and an estimated 3-day battery life. It sports a 1.32-inch AMOLED display with 60Hz refresh rate and 2,200 nits of brightness.</p><p>Aside from the larger 1.5-inch display and 631mAh capacity, the 47mm Watch 3 and this Oppo watch have identical Snapdragon W5 and BES2800 MCU chips, 2GB/32GB memory, health sensors, IP68 resistance, and display quality.</p><p>That's why it's fair to assume that this 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 will match the Watch X2 Mini specs — though the U.S. version isn't likely to share its eSIM support.</p>

<p>We don't know if this 43mm model will be called "OnePlus Watch 3 Mini" or if the "OnePlus Watch 3" will simply come in two sizes. It's also possible it could be called the OnePlus Watch 3R, as the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a>.</p><p>Whatever it's called, this model isn't actually that "mini" — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 40mm</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3 41mm</a> weigh 7–9g less — but it uses that extra weight for about 40mAh of extra capacity. Samsung and Google's watches are rated to last 1–2 days; we're excited to see if this new OnePlus Watch 3 can truly last three days on Wear OS.</p><p>At 345mAh, this watch has 286mAh less capacity than the 47mm Watch 3 model, which lasts five days. If OnePlus successfully delivers three days in a smaller package, it'll pressure other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> brands to deliver better battery life, too.</p><p>Truly, the only question is price. The Oppo model costs CNY 1,799, or about $249 converted. But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-releases-with-a-hefty-price-tag-in-the-us-and-we-dont-know-why">OnePlus bumped its Watch 3 price from $330 to $500</a> without explanation. Tariff concerns are the most likely reason, whether or not Chinese smartwatches are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">exempted from tariffs</a>.</p><p>If this watch gets its own 50% price boost, it would put the 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 at about $375, which is pricey but not too far from the $350 Pixel Watch 3. If the price creeps any higher, it could impact how many people choose to buy one, even if it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Code in Google's app suggests the company is working on a feature for Gemini called "Scheduled Actions."</li><li>Little is known; however, the feature will use cards to display tasks with markers for "Completed," "Paused," and more.</li><li>With so little, speculation runs rampant as Google could merge a little of Tasks with inspiration from OpenAI's "Scheduled Actions" for ChatGPT.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is supposedly working on another expansion of Gemini's capabilities on Android, which might look familiar.</p><p>In an APK teardown of a recent Google app version, tipster AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-scheduled-actions-apk-teardown-3544727/">Android Authority</a> located the early stages of "Scheduled Actions." The feature was working properly; however, the tipster was able to unearth the basics of Scheduled Actions, which seems to focus on automated tasks. The code mentions "cards," which likely refers to what users will see when setting up a task for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to complete.</p><p>Within that comes a little more understanding, like "List of scheduled actions," "Completed," and "Paused."</p><p>Aside from barebones code, the tipster found that Google's early development is placing access to Scheduled Actions in your Account management page. The feature is listed alongside other "More from Gemini" choices. For now, the feature appears blank, only stating the cards for what you've scheduled will "appear here."</p>
<h2 id="where-google-might-go-2">Where Google might go</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini's Scheduled Actions are still shrouded in uncertainty, but there are a couple of directions this could go: the Tasks route or the ChatGPT way. If it's the former, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tasks-dedicated-website-goes-live">then it's a little simple</a>. Tasks have remained a core way for Android users (if desired) to keep a reliable reminder of what needs to get done. Users can set the time, date, and a description for the tasks. Additionally, there's its cadence, whether it repeats or not.</p><p>It might seem odd if Google goes in this direction, considering users can link their Tasks app to Gemini and work it that way.</p><p>The publication speculates the company could be developing a ChatGPT-inspired feature that resembles its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-scheduled-tasks-beta-rollout">Scheduled Tasks</a>." This entered beta in January, which gave testers a chance to leverage the AI's capabilities for reminders and more interesting tasks. ChatGPT could search the internet for news, summarize it, and deliver it to you at a specific time every day.</p><p>During the beta, OpenAI said the feature uses GPT-4o, which limits it to 10 tasks at a time. There's a chance — given the similar name — that Google is looking to move in on OpenAI's experimental feature (after OpenAI did it to Tasks). Regardless, it's still pretty early, so things could always change on Gemini's side.</p>

<hr>
<p>Joining Google's slew of April System updates is a security feature for Android devices that remain locked for a prolonged time.</p><p>The company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">updated the April portion</a> of its Play Services update changelog, which mentions a new security/privacy update for Android (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/android-auto-restart-security/">9to5Google</a>). Google says the update, specifically for phones, brings an "automatic restart" function for devices that have remained locked for "three consecutive days." More importantly, the update's changelog lacks the specifics for this feature.</p><p>It seems this feature should arrive for the majority of Android devices, but time will tell as it slowly rolls out.</p><p>The publication dives deeper, stating this automatic reboot after three days will return the device to a BFU state, otherwise known as Before First Unlock. Designed to bolster your security, the BFU state encrypts your information. This state is also what many users experience when restarting their device manually and seeing "Unlock for all features" on the lock screen.</p><p>Rolling out with v25.14 of Play Services, Google says this security feature is joined by a few phone utility updates. Users are in for improvements to the data transfer experience when setting up a new device and general bug fixes. Current speculation suggests v25.14 will hit Android devices in the next couple of weeks.</p>

A highlight of that update was the battery improvements the company rolled out for the majority of Android devices, this includes PCs and Wear OS devices, as well as phones. While these may see a little more life battery-wise, the patch refined connectivity across Android devices for more stability.</p><p>Google rolled out a small update for its "Ask a question" feature in the Play Store, enabling it to provide information for videos.</p><p>Last week also held the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">April 2025 security update</a> for Pixels. Google was once again looking to fix a few lingering camera issues Pixel owners have reported for the 6 and 7 series.

Users can surface Gemini for questions or bring up Circle to Search for a more intuitive search. Seven years of updates also ensures the Pixel 9 Pro XL will stick around — if you'll have it.</p></p>

<hr>
<p>Google is expanding access to its "photorealistic" video generator, Veo 2, today (Apr. 15) for Gemini users and Whisk testers.</p><p>Powered by Google's Veo 2 video generation model, its press release states its abilities are now arriving for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini Advanced</a> users globally. The company touts its AI model's ability to "translate text-based prompts into dynamic videos." Integrating with Gemini, Google says users can create videos ranging from short stories to visual concepts and "specific scenes." The feature relies heavily on the user's description, so those getting involved are encouraged to be as detailed as possible with Veo 2.</p><p>As it hits Gemini Advanced, users can select Veo 2's capabilities in the drop-down menu. After inputting your text description, the model will create a short, eight-second clip. The file will be provided in MP4 format with a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>Users can take their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-veo-2-becomes-widely-available-as-it-teases-gemini-2-5-flash">Veo 2</a> generated videos and share them. For mobile, Google directs users to the new "Share" button, which will let you upload your eight-second clip to YouTube Shorts and TikTok.</p><p>As this rolls out for Gemini Advanced users, Google states it's taking the safety of this video generator seriously and will continue to listen to user feedback. More importantly, safeguards are in place to ensure users cannot generate content that violates its policies. All videos generated in Veo 2 are marked with SynthID, giving awareness to all others that the content shown has been AI-generated.</p><p>Gemini Advanced users will also find a "monthly limit" on the number of videos you can have Veo 2 create. While the magic number wasn't stated, Google says Gemini will let you know when you're approaching your limit.</p>

<p>Veo 2 is also arriving in Google's current AI experiment, Whisk. The model's arrival introduces "Whisk Animate," to help users better visualize their ideas through AI generation. While Whisk testers are used to working with images, Google's Veo 2 update lets you take those photos and give them life — if life was an eight-second clip. Users should find vivid and bold colors in these short clips.</p><p>Whisk Animate, courtesy of Veo 2 is rolling out today (Apr. 15). Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/whisk">give it a try</a>; however, it is restricted to global  Google One AI Premium subscribers.</p><p>Last December, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-whisk-image-video-generation-updates">the company introduced</a> new updates for its Veo 2 and Imagen 3 models. That announcement also held the grand introduction of Whisk, an experimental AI test for Labs users. The model's tagline is "Prompt less, Play More," which is highlighted by Whisk's ability to opt to forgo text descriptions by providing images to fit its three requirements: subject, scene, and style.</p><p>Whisk will "consider" everything in those images to create a brand-new product for whatever you have in mind. At the time, Google highlighted that its AI could get crucial details wrong, like hair, skin tone, and the like. However, Whisk contains a "Review & Edit" button that users can utilize to push the AI to get things right.</p>
