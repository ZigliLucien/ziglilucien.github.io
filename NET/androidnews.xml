<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want one of the best Android phones ever built, with ridiculously-good battery life, a stunning OLED display, and IP69 water/dust resistance.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, trade-in opportunity, or carrier deal; you need all of the latest AI tools; you&apos;d prefer a device from Samsung or Google.  </p><p>Senior editor Nicholas Sutrich gave the OnePlus 13 a rare 5/5-star rating in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">his review of the phone</a>, and it isn&apos;t hard to see why. For starters, the flagship boasts an eye-friendly 6.8-inch OLED display that&apos;s simply a joy to look at, while the IP69 water/resistance rating means that the phone is tough enough to stick in a dishwasher (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl5QVUadfbs"><strong>yes, we actually did this</strong></a>). </p><p>Things get even more impressive under the hood, as the OnePlus 13 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, widely considered to be the best chip used in Android phones today. You also get exceptional battery life and Oxygen OS 15 with six years of software updates guaranteed.</p><p>Sure, $749.99 is still a lot to spend on a smartphone, and if you want all of the latest AI-boosted software features with offline connectivity then you might be better off investing in a Samsung or Pixel phone. But if you simply want a powerful device with great performance, long-lasting battery life, and a durable construction that you can count on, then the OnePlus 13 is a dream come true.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Plus is going to be a hot topic of discussion since both are priced roughly the same, and both offer unique selling points and trade-offs. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">S25 Edge</a> puts design over everything else making it the slimmest and lightest flagship from Samsung yet. Certain cuts to the cameras and battery have had to be made to achieve this, but if all you care about is having the lightest phone, it doesn't get much better than this.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> looks fat and heavy in comparison but in its own right, it's still slimmer and lighter than most other flagships. It's also a bit cheaper and packs a few more features than the Edge. If you're stuck deciding between which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phone</a> to choose, here's a breakdown of all the main differences and similarities, so you can make the right choice.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Plus: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-8" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the front, both phones look pretty similar since they have the same display size of 6.7 inches. If you look closer though, the Galaxy S25 Plus has a slightly softer curve for the four corners, compared to the sharper corners of the Galaxy S25 Edge. Both phones use Samsung's Armor Aluminum frame and scratch-resistant glass for the front and back. The S25 Edge gets the latest Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 for the display and Victus 2 on the back, whereas the S25 Plus uses Victus 2 on both sides.</p><p>The layout of the rear cameras is also different as the Galaxy S25 Plus has individual cutouts for the three lenses, while the S25 Edge gets a little island with two lenses similar to the 2025 Galaxy A series phones. Both phones are IP68 rated for dust and water resistance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4216px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="gNFSyPBLYGm4Aukm8hZPJW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-07" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus on a table at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gNFSyPBLYGm4Aukm8hZPJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4216" height="2372" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy S25 Plus have virtually identical display specs. The 6.7-inch screens have a Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel with a QHD+ resolution and adaptive refresh rate (1Hz-120Hz). Both have the same peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits and support HDR playback.</p><p>We've not got a chance to test the S25 Edge yet, but the S25 Plus' display performed really well in all lighting conditions. It managed to produce excellent colors, had great sunlight legibility, and everything looked crisp and sharp thanks to the high resolution and dense pixel count.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge starts at $1,099.99 for 256GB of storage, but Samsung is offering the 512GB variant for the same price as part of its launch offers. Typically, the 512GB variant costs $1,219.99. The Galaxy S25 Plus starts at $999.99 for the same base storage as the Edge, while the 512GB variant costs $1,119.99. The latter is typically available closer to $1,000 on Amazon, even without sales.</p><p>What's common between the two is the SoC. Both phones are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, so performance should be more or less identical. We're yet to test the S25 Edge so we're not sure if Samsung has throttled the performance a bit in order to keep the chip running cool when stressed. That's something we will be keeping an eye on when we review it.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus has a better selection of rear cameras compared to the S25 Edge. The third camera is a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, which should capture sharper photos than the Edge's digital zoom. Samsung has equipped the Edge with the 200MP main camera from the S25 Ultra, and this allows it to do 2x in-sensor zoom with seemingly no loss in image quality. The S25 Plus has a 50MP main camera which is still quite capable, even though it lacks in resolution. Both phones are capable of 8K video recording and shooting in HDR.</p><p>Battery life is another area where the S25 Plus has the clear upper hand thanks to the massive 4,900mAh capacity. It also supports 45W charging but the charger needs to be bought separately. The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 3,900mAh battery which is much smaller than the S25 Plus, and there's only 25W charging. Both phones have wireless charging rated at 15W.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy S25 Plus should have pretty much the same software features. Both phones run One UI 7 which is based on Android 15, and should be getting all future updates roughly around the same time. The S25 Plus and Edge will be getting seven years of OS upgrades and security patches. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> has a bunch of customization and useful AI features to play with. Both phones also support Gemini Live and many Galaxy AI features like Writing Assist, Photo Assist, and Note Assist.</p>

<p>With both phones costing more or less the same, depending on which storage variant you pick, the Galaxy S25 Plus is the one I'd recommend to most buyers. It's simply the better phone thanks to the much larger battery and more versatile rear cameras. Compared to other flagship phones, it's actually on the slimmer and lighter side.</p><p>I don't see many people opting for the Galaxy S25 Edge over the S25 Plus, unless you must have the slimmest possible flagship. Samsung ideally should have done more in terms of design to make the Edge feel special, after all, it is a highly specialized phone. I'm still not sure what purpose it serves, other than maybe being a pre-emptive move against Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air.</p><p>To reiterate, get the Galaxy S25 Plus over the S25 Edge. You'll thank me later.</p>

<p>Gemini is preparing to make its official debut in yet another of Google's core apps, and here's a hint: it'll help make surfing the web easier.</p><p>As detailed in a press release, Google Chrome is on deck to welcome Gemini into its world on May 21 for Google AI Ultra and AI Pro subscribers in the U.S. The company adds Gemini will be available for these Chrome users so long as they're rocking the browser's latest version (and with English as their set language).</p><p>Gemini is arriving in Early Access for Chrome, pulling along a feature that lets users understand content on the web with ease. Moreover, Gemini can even complete tasks for you on the webpage you're on.</p><p>Google teases that tomorrow's arrival will also introduce text and talking capabilities with Gemini Live.</p><p>Additionally, Google informs that users will have a set of shortcuts to use when Gemini appears in Chrome. The AI can be easily accessed via the OS Task bar, Chrome tab strip, and shortcuts like Ctrl+G on Mac and Alt+G on Windows.</p>

<p>With Gemini arriving tomorrow (May 21) in Chrome, Google says this isn't the end. There will be more. Specifically, "more" concerns enabling Gemini in Chrome to work "across multiple devices at the same time." What's more, Google wants to make Gemini capable of moving through websites without the user's input.</p><p>As an example, Google says "Gemini in Chrome will be able to navigate to a specific portion of a recipe site with a single command."</p><p>Further down the line, the post states there are plans to let users "imagine" what Gemini should do and let it run. Google states it wants to simplify daily, mundane tasks for users, turning longer browsing journeys into quick three-click sprints.</p><p>Earlier today, during I/O 2025, Google discussed what it wants out of Gemini, and that involves turning it into a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-vision-world-model-explained">World Model.</a>" To achieve this, Google is looking to incorporate the multitasking power of Project Mariner and the visualizing power of Project Astra into Gemini. More than that, they want Gemini's intelligence to be able to "simulate" and understand the world, so it can create plans for its users.</p>

It's also extremely light, packs the main 200MP camera from the S25 Ultra, and features a flagship Qualcomm SoC for the best gaming experience. Some obvious compromises have been made like a much smaller battery with last-gen charging speeds and only two rear cameras. It's also quite expensive starting at above $1,000.</p></p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>The absolute best</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is everything you could ever hope for from a flagship phone and more. It has the best display, battery life, cameras, and performance, along with a useful built-in stylus and many years of software support. Cramming all this into one device has its downsides like a large and heavy footprint, something the S25 Edge addresses in spades.</p></p>

<p>Let's face it, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> is a phone no one really asked for but Samsung felt the need that it should exist, so here we are. It's essentially a mix of the Galaxy S25 Plus and Ultra but put in an extremely thin and light chassis. On its own, it's a great little flagship option for anyone looking for something super-thin and light. The problem is with its pricing. It starts at a little over $1,000, which is about $200 shy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>The Ultra is Samsung's hero product so anyone spending this sort of money on the S25 Edge really needs to think hard about one thing — wouldn't it make sense to spend a bit more and get a much better product? While the Galaxy S25 Edge doesn't really compete with the S25 Ultra directly, from a buyer's perspective, doing a comparative analysis is crucial in order to make the right decision.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-14" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most stark difference between the Galaxy S25 Edge and the S25 Ultra is the design. The Edge is ridiculously thin at just 5.8mm and extremely light at just 163 grams. The frame is Armor Aluminum and there's Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 over the display. The rear panel gets Gorilla Glass Victus. The corners of the S25 Edge have softer curves which actually feel nice to hold, based on our hour-long hands-on with the phone.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is boxier, heavier, and thicker than the S25 Edge. This is only amplified if you decide to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">use a case</a> on it. The Ultra can be a bit cumbersome to hold for long with one hand or carry around in a pocket, due to its weight and awkward size.  It's extremely well-built though and sturdy thanks to the titanium frame. Its display also gets a special anti-reflective treatment which the S25 Edge lacks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-lock-screen" alt="View of the lock screen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones have extremely high-resolution displays that look absolutely fantastic. The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch LTPO Super AMOLED 2X panel, with a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 3,120x1,440 pixels. Incidentally, it has the same 2,600 nits of peak brightness as the S25 Ultra, so sunlight legibility should be on par. The bezels are extremely slim and the hole-punch for the front camera isn't distracting.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a larger 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED display but with the same resolution, which means the pixel count is lower. It's still well above 450 ppi so you won't really notice this even when viewing the same content on both phones side by side. The anti-reflective coating on the Ultra is a game-changer when viewing the display under sunlight or with artificial lighting behind you, and it's a shame that the Edge misses out on it.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge starts at $1,099.99 for 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, and the 512GB variant is priced at $1,219.99. If you buy from Samsung.com, you can get the top-end variant for the price of the base as part of the launch offers. The Edge comes in three colors, Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver, and Titanium Jetblack. The finishes look good but the colors are exactly exciting.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra starts at $1,299.99 for 256GB storage and 12GB RAM, but Samsung is offering the 512GB variant at this price if you buy directly from its website. The Ultra also has a 1TB storage variant for $1,419.99. The S25 Ultra comes in four colors and this is not including the three exclusive shades that are only available through Samsung.com.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge and Gaalxy S25 Ultra use the same custom 'Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy' chip, so performance should be identical. We are yet to review the S25 Edge and we'll have a full report for you on its performance, but till then you can read out detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra review</a> to know what to expect. I suspect the Edge could have lower thermal thresholds due to its slim size, which could throttle performance of the SoC a lot quicker than the Ultra. This is so that the phone doesn't get excessively hot to hold. It's just an assumption right now as we'll know for certain once we review it.</p><p>Another compromise area is the cameras. The Galaxy S25 Edge only has two rear camera, one of which is the same 200MP main sensor from the Ultra. Samsung also talks about a 2x optical zoom which essentially uses an in-sensor crop to achieve it. The ultrawide is sadly just a 12MP sensor and not a 50MP module from the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has two additional rear cameras for zoom, one 3x telephoto and a 50MP periscope-style telephoto with 5x optical zoom. If you need long-range photography, stick to the Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bs4kXScTBYTEFvzgXh8PQa" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25 Edge" alt="Samsung-Galaxy-S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bs4kXScTBYTEFvzgXh8PQa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, battery life is one area where the Galaxy S25 Ultra should easily beat the S25 Edge. We're talking a 5,000mAh capacity vs. 3,900mAh. With mindful usage, you should be able to squeeze out a full day's worth of use from the S25 Edge but I wouldn't expect anything beyond that. Heavy app and camera use could knock down battery life even quicker. The S25 Ultra should easily sail through one full day and more on a single charge as no amount of software optimization can compensate for a physically larger battery.</p><p>Charging speeds are also better on the Ultra. You get 45W fast charging here, compared to just 25W on the Edge. Given the smaller size of the battery, 25W should still be decently quick but not as quick as the Ultra. Wireless charging is the same 15W on both phones.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy S25 Ultra should have identical software. Both phones run One UI 7 which is based on Android 15, and should be getting all future updates roughly around the same time. Both will be getting seven years of OS upgrades and security patches. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> right around the corner,  we should see the One UI 8 update pop up for both pretty soon, once the new Galaxy foldables are launched.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> is Samsung's best software update yet. The new visual design is very pleasing, you can finally switch the app drawer to vertical scrolling without being forced to install a third-party launcher, there's much better customizability, and plenty of AI-focused add-ons. Among the many Galaxy AI features, some of the standout ones include Photo Assist, Transcript Assist, and Now Brief.</p>

<p>As much as I love a thin and light phone, I cannot justify recommending the S25  Edge at its current price over the Galaxy S25 Ultra. I'd rather pay the $200 premium and get the complete flagship experience, and this is what I'd suggest you do too. In the long run, I think the heft and bulk of the Ultra is something you'll get used to, but not having certain features like telephoto cameras and a larger battery could end up being nagging issues.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge needs to be cheaper in order for it to be a real, viable option. Even a die-hard Samsung fan will have to really think twice before spending $1,000+ on it. It's a fantastic little flagship, no doubt, but it offers poor value for money at its current price.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Xreal unveiled Project Aura at Google I/O, the company's first pair of Android XR-powered smart glasses.</li><li>Project Aura will be the first pair of Android XR glasses on the market, likely coming later this year.</li><li>Xreal also opened up preorders for Xreal Eye, a camera add-on for its existing Xreal One glasses that enable 6DoF tracking, photos, and mixed reality video.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android XR is almost here, and along with the unveiling of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-glasses-coming-designed-by-gentle-monster-warby-parker">latest Android XR developer preview</a> came a first look at Xreal Project Aura, the company's first Android XR-powered smart glasses.</p><p>Xreal Project Aura will differentiate itself from the company's other glasses by including Qualcomm silicon and Google's new AR/VR operating system, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, under the hood. This will allow the glasses to run Google Play Store apps as well as Google's Gemini AI assistant, all in "a lightweight and tethered device," according to Xreal.</p><p>The render of Project Aura that Xreal provided shows three cameras up front to capture spatial data, meaning the glasses will be able to track the space you're in, similar to a VR headset. While Xreal didn't describe the experience, these glasses will be able to overlay virtual imagery onto the real world, similar to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-mwc-2024">we saw at MWC 2024</a>. This time, though, the hardware will not only be better, but the software experience will have a lot more development time behind it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ" name="Android-XR-Maps-2" alt="A still from an Android XR example video of how the software will work on smart glasses, showing someone navigating city streets with Google Maps, with a map view holograph showing when to turn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Project Aura is an optical see-through (OST) XR device, meaning you can see the real world through transparent lenses like a normal pair of sunglasses. These are useful for seeing notifications or navigating in real-time without looking down at a phone, helping to protect your safety in many ways while on a busy city street.</p><p>Project Aura will run Qualcomm silicon and the Android XR operating system, but they'll still need to be plugged into your phone for power and communication. This is almost certainly the best way for Xreal to achieve the lightweight and slim form factor, while true standalone XR glasses are still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">a bit on the chunky side</a>.</p><p>In its Google I/O keynote, Google noted that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> XR headset would be launching first. While the smart glasses side of Android XR still needs a bit more time in the oven, Xreal Project Aura will be the first device to debut the OS's smart glasses era, potentially later this year or in early 2026.</p>
<h2 id="xreal-eye-2">Xreal Eye</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QAsv5tjEbzgQfzEoLEDQKd" name="xreal-one-eye-official-close-up" alt="An official render of the Xreal Eye add-on installed on a pair of Xreal One glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QAsv5tjEbzgQfzEoLEDQKd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xreal Eye is a new $99 add-on for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> smart glasses. The camera snaps into the POGO pins located on the underside of the Xreal One glasses' nose bridge and requires no additional hardware to function.</p><p>Xreal says that Xreal Eye enables quick image capture with the press of a button on the side of the glasses, as well as spatial 6DoF tracking. Spatial 6DoF tracking is similar to a VR headset, so you'll be able to move around more comfortably without the virtual display shifting to be centered on your vision. In other words, it will feel even more like a TV sitting in the real world than the glasses current 3DoF solution enables.</p><p>Since Xreal Eye uses a single camera, tracking won't be quite as robust as what will be offered on Project Aura glasses, which features three cameras for greater accuracy.</p>

Without a Beam Pro, you'll just be able to take pictures using the Eye camera.</p><p>The official Xreal Eye page <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xreal.com/eye/">is now live</a>, and preorders are available in some countries. Xreal is expected to offer the Eye in late June, so be sure to sign up or preorder if you're interested.</p>

<ul><li>Gmail gains AI-powered personalized reply suggestions, inbox cleanup, and faster appointment scheduling.</li><li>Google Meet gets real-time speech translation in multiple languages for the latest AI Pro and Ultra subscribers.</li><li>Google Vids also leverages AI to convert slides to videos, refine recordings, generate scripts with AI avatars, and improve audio.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The biggest Google I/O event is here, and the search giant has a lot to offer across its products. Like in previous years, the focus is again on AI and its incorporation into its services.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/new-ways-to-do-your-best-work">showcased</a> a glimpse of AI integration in its Workspace products like Gmail, Meet, Vids, and Docs, and they get new capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-in-gmail-2">Gemini in Gmail</h2>
<p>Starting with Gmail, regular users will now be able to reply to their emails with the help of AI. In instances like replying to an email or a thread where gathering previous details could be an intriguing task, new personalized replies in Gmail are coming into play. Users can draft their emails through AI suggestions that match their specific context and tone.</p><p>The response suggestions here will be based on past emails, alongside Google Drive, to get additional context. Google notes that Gemini can further adapt to users’ tone eventually, which can be crisp, formal, or conversational.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CXHYTwTwjhFEvLYqP2RL8W" name="Gmail-personalized-replies-feature" alt="Gmail personalized replies feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CXHYTwTwjhFEvLYqP2RL8W.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of emails, they tend to generally pile up, making users difficult to manage sometimes. That's where Gemini comes to your rescue again, as it can now start deleting or archiving emails with the new Inbox clean-up. Users will be able to tell Gemini to “delete all of my unread emails” from any specific user or a subscription to tidy up things in their inbox.</p><p>Additionally, fast appointment scheduling will be integrated into Gmail soon. It means users will be able to offer times for customers or clients who are normally out of their organization and not in their conventional calendar. Gemini in Gmail will also be able to detect when a user is trying to set up a meeting and give users “a helpful nudge,” making it easier to share the booking page right within the email app. The aim is to sort things out by reducing the time and effort spent coordinating schedules.</p><p>All the aforementioned features for Gmail will be available for the next quarter.</p>
<h2 id="google-meet-gains-language-translation-2">Google Meet gains language translation</h2>
<p>Google Meet should soon be able to diminish language barriers in calls as it is gaining a speech translation feature. It helps listeners in a call listen to their language despite the speaker speaking in their preferred language, that too in real time. Google is also promising low-latency while maintaining their voice, tone, and expression. Overall, the conversation across both parties is likely to appear more authentic and natural.</p><p>The speech translation feature is available for Google Meet users for those who are subscribed to Google AI Pro and Ultra plans in beta, and is initially available in English and Spanish. More of them are promised to be added in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2 id="google-vids-can-turn-slides-into-videos-2">Google Vids can turn slides into videos</h2>
<p>Google Vids, which was launched last year, is now gaining notable features. They can now turn existing Google Slides into engaging videos. Slides or presentations can sometimes be boring; however, they are essential in organizations, be it to train teams, onboard new employees, and explain things. Such slides can now easily be converted into videos through Google Vids, which presumably captures the audience’s attention more than the slides.</p><p>Gemini is further believed to generate scripts, voiceovers, animations, and more.</p><p>Google Vids usually help users record things, and they can sometimes have distracting or filler words like “ums” and “ahs”. Integration of Gemini in Vids will help users trim such filler words and awkward pauses through the transcript trim feature, which can be triggered with a single click. With the help of AI, users will also be able to adjust sound levels in instances where sound quality is uneven, eliminating the need for complicated audio mixing.</p>

<p>Making training videos can be a hideous task, especially if there are dozens of them. Google Vids already allows users to make videos, and going further, users can just write a script and choose a new AI avatar feature to deliver the message on behalf of you. While the avatar does the talking, it claims to be handy to create polished video content and skip the process of coordinating talent and video production.</p><p>While converting slides to videos will be available for users next quarter, the Balance sound will be available next month, and transcript trim will arrive in Labs next quarter. The AI Avatar, on the other hand, is coming to Labs next month. Interestingly, all these features are included for those who are on a Google AI Pro or Ultra plan.</p>

<p>Generating an image in Slides, Vids, and Docs just got better with the inclusion of Imagen 4—  announced today at Google I/O. It promises to enhance users’ visual storytelling as Imagen 4 helps create richer, detailed visuals, accurate spelling, and text rendering for images. And, it is available for users starting today.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's AI just seems to progress; however, the company is now detailing its true vision for its software.</p><p>In a post written by Google's DeepMind CEO, Demis Hassabis, the company discussed how it wants to go about building a "universal AI." This plan is firmly set on the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, which Google says is wants to morph into a "world model." Hassabis states there's are hopes for Gemini to become an AI that can "make plans and imagine new experiences." This will reportedly be done by enabling the AI to "understand and simulate aspects of the world."</p><p>Google attributes this way of thinking and forethought to that of the human brain.</p><p>Hassabis says the company isn't starting from zero with these ambitions. The company has reportedly observed instances of this world understanding and simulation in Gemini when natural environments are involved. Google stresses that it wants Gemini to become intelligent, one that can understand the "context you're in" and "take action on your behalf, across devices."</p><p>Speaking of tasks, Hassabis explains that Google has been mulling over the thought of bringing Project Mariner into Gemini for multitasking.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner</a> revealed itself to users in December, and Google says it's been hard at work, working with testers to gather feedback on it. Since December, Mariner has grown to have the ability to complete ten tasks at once, says Hassabis. The agents within Project Mariner enable the software to research information, book shows or other events, and research topics all at once.</p><p>It's this level of multitasking that Hassabis says will help usher Gemini into that "world model" ideal.</p><p>What's more, Project Astra will work in tandem with Mariner to bring Gemini into a more universal setting. Google states Astra's functions, like video understanding, screen sharing, and memory, will be a great asset. Project Astra has since worked its way into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>. From that, Google's taken in a load of feedback from users to bring even more to Gemini Live, Search, and the Live API.</p><p>In March, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">announced</a> that it was bringing Project Astra to Gemini. With these new details, we're now understanding a little better <em>why </em>Google did this, and it's outlook/future plans for Gemini. At the time, Google said it was bringing Project Astra over from its DeepMind team <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">as it prepares</a> for its public launch.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-i-o-2025-live-blog">I/O 2025 developer conference</a>, Google introduced the latest update to Wear OS meant to carry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">smartwatches</a> into a new era. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> brings a wave of changes, including bold designs, smoother motions, and some extra battery life to keep your watch going longer.</p><p>Wear OS 6 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/material-3-expressive-is-return-to-form-pixel-watch-4-needs">coming in hot with Material 3 Expressive</a>, a new design that blends style and smarts, as per Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/whats-new-in-wear-os-6.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. It brings dynamic theming to the table, so your watch face and apps can shift colors to match your vibe.</p><p>The round display is getting some real attention too, with UI elements that wrap around the edges and layouts that make every quick glance worth it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.89%;"><img id="JNhoG4ZSBHKBsc4Ksz8uK3" name="Wear-OS-6-Material-3-Expressive" alt="Material 3 Expressive design language in Wear OS 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNhoG4ZSBHKBsc4Ksz8uK3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1027" height="574" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="battery-bonus-2">Battery bonus</h2>
<p>This update is giving your battery some love too. Wear OS 6 promises up to 10% more juice compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, so your watch keeps ticking longer without constantly hunting for a charger.</p><p>Developers can now play with new Jetpack libraries (Wear Compose Material 3 and Wear ProtoLayout Material 3) to weave these new designs into their apps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.77%;"><img id="RKf2uNFbDASZMvAUzB4d3B" name="Wear-OS-6-tile-layout" alt="3-section tile layout in Wear OS 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RKf2uNFbDASZMvAUzB4d3B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1027" height="583" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tiles are getting a major facelift, too. A new 3-slot layout (title, main content, and a bottom slot) keeps the interface clean, while dynamic theming ensures your tiles blend seamlessly with your watch face.</p><p>Also new is what Google calls "Edge Buttons." It hugs the sides of the screen, maximizing space on a 1.2-inch display.</p>

<p>Wear OS 6 also unlocks new tools, like animated transitions and support for photo-based designs. Plus, a fresh API makes it easier to build watch face marketplaces, so expect even more creative options soon.</p>

<p>The update also introduces enhanced media controls, including fast-forward, rewind, and playlist access. And in a nod to younger users, Google is expanding its lineup with Galaxy Watch for Kids, a phone-free way for little ones to stay connected safely.</p><p>For developers, the Wear OS 6 emulator is now live in Android Studio, along with codelabs and design kits to kickstart projects. Users, meanwhile, can look forward to the full rollout later this year.</p>

<p>It's been a quiet few months since Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, but at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-i-o-2025-live-blog">Google I/O 2025</a>, the company outlined its ambitious plans for Gemini-powered smart glasses and AR glasses, trying to court developers to build XR apps — or their <em>own</em> smart glasses!</p><p>Google didn't officially confirm a name for its Android XR glasses, but it's "partnering with innovative eyewear brands, starting with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker, to create stylish glasses."</p><p>Just as Meta relies on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">(allegedly) Oakley</a> to design its Meta AI glasses, Google wants expert design help for its own smart glasses. Google confirmed they'll have a "camera, microphones and speakers," plus an "optional in-lens display."</p>

<p>In other words, Google plans to sell stylish Gemini AI glasses that sync with your Android phone, but only some will have holographic tech for Google apps like Maps and Messages. Its non-XR glasses will be more affordable, competing directly with Ray-Ban Meta glasses.</p><p>Samsung, which first used Android XR for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan headset</a> coming out later in 2025, will now use Android XR for its smart glasses, too. Google announced both companies will team up on a "software and reference hardware platform" to help other manufacturers "make great glasses."</p><p>One company, XREAL, has already used an early version of this software platform, announcing its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye">Project Aura AR glasses</a> on stage at I/O.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ" name="Android-XR-Maps-2" alt="A still from an Android XR example video of how the software will work on smart glasses, showing someone navigating city streets with Google Maps, with a map view holograph showing when to turn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During the I/O 2025 keynote, Google showed an idealized vision of how its apps would look on an XR glasses display.</p><p>In one clip, the Android XR user tells Gemini to set a Calendar birthday event. It pops up in her vision so that she can confirm the details are correct; then she follows up to create a Task to buy a present before the party, all while cooking dinner.</p><p>In another, the Google XR glasses wearer asks Gemini for a good nearby ramen place, then has the AI guide it to the destination using directional arrows and a mini-map in a portion of their vision. It looks similar to Maps Live View on your phone, only now your phone would be in your pocket.</p>

<p>Other Android XR app examples included a Google Messages pop-up, a live Google Translate conversation, and a quick Photos snap during a dance party.</p><p>All of them will rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini </a>voice commands, though we'd love to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-watches-are-sidekick-gemini-needs-for-android-xr-to-work">alternative control options</a> in the future. Google promises that Gemini will "see and hear what you do" through the camera and "remember what's important to you" when asking questions later.</p><p>As seamless as these XR apps look in concept, Google will need to create hardware that's lightweight and efficient enough for portable processing, but with good enough resolution to make text clearly visible in the bottom third of your vision.</p><p>That will be a tall order to deliver in untethered, consumer-priced glasses! Android Central will be demoing Google's XR glasses at I/O today, and we'll report back whether the hardware lives up to Google's software promises.</p>

<p>While Google will eventually target consumers with Gentle Monster-designed glasses, its I/O presentation focuses more on developers. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/updates-to-android-xr-sdk-developer-preview.html">blog post</a>, it shared the new Developer Preview 2 tools available today, created based on feedback to the first preview.</p><p>While it all gets very technical, here's a simplified breakdown of the key dev features coming to Android XR:</p>
<ul><li>Apps can now use the background hand tracking SKD (with user permission), with 26 posed hand joints tracked.</li><li>The Jetpack SDK now supports stereoscopic 180° and 360° videos</li><li>Devs can draw a <a href="https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/add-subspace">subspace</a> for 3D content and choose how much space it takes on the display, so it's not too large in your vision</li><li>Unity OpenXR games get a performance boost, including dynamic refresh rate</li><li>You can "integrate Gen AI into your apps" using Firebase AI Logic for Unity.</li></ul>
<p>Currently, all of these tools focus on traditional XR for headsets, not glasses. The post explains that they are still "shaping" dev tools for smart glasses and that they'll share more details before the end of 2025.</p><p>Google also promises that the Android XR Play Store will launch later in 2025 with compatible 2D apps. But devs that create <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/android-xr#android-xr-differentiated">"differentiated" XR apps</a> with spatial panels, environments, 3D models, and other XR-specific traits will get special attention.</p>

<p>Google I/O 2025 has been a flurry of announcements, but here's another concerning how users can grow on Play.</p><p>At its core, the Google Play Store is developing a new ways to improve engagement for developers and users. According to its press release, the company says it the Play Store will soon receive "topic browse pages." The post claims this feature will deliver "timely, relevant, and visually engaging content on specific topics." These browsing pages will reportedly incorporate multiple aspects of the store, like App Home and store listings, among others.</p><p>We'll likely understand more of it once it arrives, which is slated for this month (May) in the U.S. Google says once its browse pages rollout, users can find them first for Media & Entertainment content.</p><p>Google expects to expand its coverage to more types of apps and content "later this year."</p>
<h2 id="play-store-users-and-devs-2">Play Store, Users, and Devs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:631px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:95.09%;"><img id="tr8D68FAAAEWTbNGDG6qvW" name="google-play-store-topic-browse-page" alt="Google's "topic browse page" will soon hit the Play Store, showing users multiple areas from within the store to increase engagement with Media & Entertainment apps at the start." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tr8D68FAAAEWTbNGDG6qvW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="631" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Engagement updates continue with Google's reported expansion of "Where to Watch." The post says users in Korea, Indonesia, the U.K., and Mexico will soon see it on the Play Store. In July, Google says more developers will have the ability to display a hero content carousel and even include YouTube videos in their store listings.</p><p>Rounding out the engagement updates is Google's "audio samples" on the Apps Home. Google says this should give users an (audible) way to experience what developers are offering first before diving in further. This will debut first for Health & Wellness content on the Play Store in the U.S. before expanding to other areas.</p>
<h2 id="more-for-developers-2">More for Developers</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:969px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.92%;"><img id="yRx5Ya3WPf2fMN4zFQ4ZVP" name="google-play-store-halt-rollout" alt="Google's Production page in the Play Store shows a developer a way to "Halt" an update rollout if there are problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yRx5Ya3WPf2fMN4zFQ4ZVP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="969" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>App development takes time, but Google looks to relieve the stress behind the management side with <em>more </em>actionable insights for devs. Specifically, Google says it will soon bring overview pages for the Grow and Monetize statistics for developers and their apps. Moreover, the company is working on bringing the ability for devs to "fully-halt" the rollout of an app's version if reports show it's causing more harm than good.</p><p>Another update makes it easier to upload, edit, and view app assets in the Play Store via the Asset Library. Google says developers can drag their content into their listings straight from Drive. It's update will even clue devs into how attractive their assets might be to users, which can feed into app engagement.</p><p>Google's also stepping up its security for developers creating apps. This concerns developers staying ahead of potential signs of abuse, protecting their app's "sensitive" actions, like transfers or data access.</p>
<h2 id="play-store-revenue-2">Play Store Revenue</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.27%;"><img id="RP3ya3XHvcninJzL9YUuzK" name="google-play-store-subscription-addons-one-price" alt="An example of how Google will let developers give users a subscription and all of its add-ons for one price, streamlining the process." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RP3ya3XHvcninJzL9YUuzK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="284" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Subscriptions concern us all — developers and end-users alike. Google states it's looking to "streamline" the subscription process to build engagement. To get this done, the post says the Play Store will introduce "multi-product checkout for subscriptions." In short, developers can sell a subscription <em>and </em>its add-ons under one "aligned payment schedule." For users, they will see one price upon purchase that incorporates the subscription and its add-ons.</p><p>Developers will gain increased control over how users can upgrade their subscription, manage add-ons, or downgrade.</p><p>Moreover, subscribers will see the benefits they will receive by purchasing what a developer (app) is offering more clearly.</p><p>Google's focus on payments doesn't end there, as the post details another update. During a device's initial setup, Google says it will look to prompt users about setting up payment methods and verification. AI isn't taking a backseat on this, as the post highlights Google's models will be present to help developers "optimize" in-app transactions.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Gemini 2.5 model picks up 2.5 Flash  to be even faster and more efficient with its actions.</li><li>Deep Think, Google's new reasoning mode, sets its sights on Gemini 2.5 Pro; however, there's an abundance of testing required before it arrives.</li><li>Gemini 2.5 Pro gains native audio output controls, meaning developers can alter the AI's tone, accent, and "style of speech."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>I/O wouldn't be the same without a few AI announcements, and that's exactly what Google is bringing to users.</p><p>In a press release, Google detailed how its Gemini 2.5 models, including 2.5 Pro, are going to advance in the near future thanks to a few updates. To begin, Gemini is going to receive Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-releases-gemini-2-5-flash-with-hybrid-reasoning-and-boasts-faster-speeds">2.5 Flash model</a>. Not only has the company touted this AI as its "most powerful" version, but its latest updates improve benchmarks for reasoning and multimodality. Moreover, Google says 2.5 Flash is now better (more efficient) at code and long context.</p><p>All Gemini users will find 2.5 Flash available in the app. Additionally, Google says this update will hit Vertex AI users with enterprise and for developers in the Google AI Studio.</p><p>Gemini's thinking capabilities are seemingly set for improvements, as Google details the incorporation of a new reasoning mode called "Deep Think." This mode is said to push Google's AI into "considering multiple hypotheses" before delivering its response. This is reportedly en route to 2.5 Pro (under the guise of 2.5 Pro Deep Think). This mode is in testing. Google states it is taking more time to conduct "frontier safety evaluations" and to hear more from the experts.</p><p>Once these initial hurdles are cleared, Google will prepare to release Deep Think more widely to users.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-2-5-rises-higher-2">Gemini 2.5 Rises Higher</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="naddjY6LTCN6Y4oF46V8wa" name="Gemini-2.5-Pro-Hero" alt="The Gemini 2.5 Pro graphic." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/naddjY6LTCN6Y4oF46V8wa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from these key highlights, Google details even more Gemini 2.5 capabilities as a result of its updates. There are three major updates, the first bringing "native" audio output and improvements to the Live API. Appearing today (May 20), Live API will deliver a preview of its audio-visual input and native audio out dialogue. This will give users conversational building capabilities within Gemini.</p><p>Moreover, this also gives users the chance to customize how Gemini speaks by altering its tone, accent, and "style of speaking."</p><p>This audio update brings an experiment for a trio of early features. Users will have a chance to play with "Affective Dialogue," which lets the AI "detect" emotions in a user's voice to facilitate an "appropriate" response. The Proactive Audio test will let Gemini ignore voices in your background, as it awaits a more proper time to respond. Thinking hits Live API for Gemini, improving its complex task capabilities.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner's</a> computer use functionality is headed for Gemini and Vertex AI. Additionally, Google states Gemini 2.5 will be receiving another security boost. This time, the AI model is picking up enhanced protections for maliciously embedded instructions and "indirect prompt injection" attacks.</p>

<p>With so much extra thought (thinking) power headed for Gemini and Vertex AI, Google is giving developers insightful summaries to help. The summaries are said to organize the AI's thinking process, as well as offer information about its actions. The entire purpose is to help developers debug the AI in case there are any lingering issues.</p><p>Cost control (via thinking budget) is on its way to Gemini 2.5 Pro "in the coming weeks." This will be joined by Google's "generally available model," too.</p><p>Lastly, Gemini 2.5 is bringing MCP (Model Context Protocol) support. This should give developers an easier time when integrating open-source tools into their Gemini work. Google teases it's also looking into MCP servers and more "hosted" tools.</p>

<hr>
<p>During Google I/O today (May 20), the tech giant announced a new video conferencing platform called Google Beam.</p><p>It's being built on<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses"> Google's Project Starline</a>, launched during the 2021 I/O conference. This enabled people to have remote conversations that felt more like face-to-face interactions. Google is taking this "Magic window" concept of seeing another person, in life-size, three dimensions, right in front of you, and turning it into an AI-powered experience.</p><p>In its press release, Google noted that it will use AI to power a new generation of devices that will allow people to have meaningful conversations even though they're remote.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yEAwcPR9swrvKSD3jQxJab" name="google-project-starline-call.gif" alt="Talking to someone on Project Starline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yEAwcPR9swrvKSD3jQxJab.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/research/project-starline-google-beam-update/">Google Beam </a>aims to transform regular 2D video calls into more realistic 3D experiences. Essentially, what this means is that the platform will use the AI tech and special light field displays, multiple cameras, as seen in Project Starline, to build a live, detailed, 3D digital copy for the user.</p><p>That copy is then displayed to the person on the other side, using the same special light field display. This screen sends different light rays to each eye, creating the illusion of depth and volume without the need for special glasses or headsets. So Google Beam will make it seem like the 3D copy of the other person is actually "there" in the room with you.</p><p>"This is what allows you to make eye contact, read subtle cues, and build understanding and trust, as if you were face to face," Google added.</p><p>Furthermore, this video conferencing platform is built on Google Cloud, just like Project Starline. The Cloud will do most of the heavy lifting for Google Beam. It will help the platform process these AI-powered 3D images and transmit them in real time to the person on the other end of the call, allowing for a seamless flow of 3D communication that seems more natural.</p>

<p>Along with Google Beam, the company is launching a real-time speech translation feature that allows people to speak freely, despite having language barriers.</p><p>This feature will let you have "near real-time translated conversations, while maintaining the voice, tone, and expressions" within the speech. For instance, if two people on a call speak different languages, such as French and English, each person can speak in their preferred language, and Google Beam will then translate the audio in real time.</p><p>Additionally, Google isn't restricting this feature just to Google Beam; it is expanding the real-time translation to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">Google Meet</a>, starting today. Users on Meet can enable the live translation feature to have seamless conversations during meetings.</p><p>The speech translation feature is available to users subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-one/google-ai-ultra">Google AI Pro and Ultra plans</a> in beta. It will initially only translate English and Spanish, but more languages are expected to be added soon.</p>
<h2 id="google-beam-in-workplaces-2">Google Beam in Workplaces</h2>
<p>Last year, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-bringing-project-starlines-3d-video-calls-to-everyone-in-2025">announced</a> that it would be integrating Project Starline into other video conferencing apps, and it will be doing the same thing with Google Beam.</p><p>This 3D video conferencing platform has been tested in Google's workspaces for years, and they're now expanding it to other companies, including Deloitte, Salesforce, Duolingo, NEC, Citadel, and more.</p><p>"Deloitte is excited about Google Beam as a groundbreaking, innovative step in human connection in the digital age. Our teams and clients confirm this solution is not just a technological breakthrough but a reimagining of how we connect," said Angel Ayala, managing director of Deloitte Consulting LLP.</p>

<p>The company is also collaborating with HP to bring Google Beam devices to the market later this year. Google is also working with Zoom, Diversified, and AVI-SPL to bring Google Beam to more people across the globe who use these platforms daily.</p><p>Lastly, the company hasn't revealed any pricing details yet, but it's likely that bigger companies like the ones mentioned above get first dibs on the software.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has announced two new subscription plans at its annual developer conference dubbed Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra.</p><p>These new plans are rolling out today (May 20), wherein the AI Ultra plan is only available for the U.S. with a promise of expansion to more countries soon.</p><p>The new Google AI Pro subscription appears to be an advanced version of the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini Advanced</a> plan as it also includes a full suite of AI products with higher rate limits, the Gemini app, and the inclusion of Flow (new AI filmmaking tool), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-standalone-app-android-debut-play-store">Notebook LM</a>, and more.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-io-2025-ai-transforms-workspace-with-gemini-integration">newly announced Gemini integration</a> across Gmail, Docs, and Vids is also part of the new Google AI Pro plan. Other perks include the Whisk tool — a Veo 2-powered image-to-video creation tool, up to 2 TB of storage for Google Photos, Drive, and Gmail.</p><p>The Google AI Ultra plan, on the other hand, which the company calls a VIP pass to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google AI</a>, is priced at $249.99 per month; however, first-time users will get 50 percent off for the first three months, making it handy at $129.99 per month.</p><p>The Gemini app as part of the AI Ultra plan includes exclusive features like Veo 3 (Google’s latest video generation model), wherein the Pro plan comprises Veo 2. Similarly, it includes the 2.5 Pro Deep Think model, whereas the Pro plan comprises the 2.5 Pro deep research model. The NotebookLM also integrates the highest limits, and the AI plan includes the best model capabilities that are said to be getting added later this year.</p>

<p>Other experimental features like Project Mariner (early access) — that allows for the streamlined tasks with an agentic research prototype — are included in the AI Ultra plan. Besides, with Gemini in the Ultra plan, users will get early access to an Agent Mode — an upcoming experimental capability arriving on desktop.</p><p>In a shared press release, Google further explains that by simply putting out an objective, Gemini intelligently orchestrates the steps to achieve it. These can include a combination of advanced features like live web browsing, in-depth research, and smart integrations with Google apps, and to further manage complex, multi-step tasks.</p><p>Lastly, this Ultra plan also gives users a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> individual plan alongside getting a whopping 30TB of total storage for Photos, Drive, and Gmail.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-52">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Announced at Google I/O, Flow uses AI to turn simple scene descriptions into full-on cinematic moments without breaking the bank.</li><li>It’s powered by Google’s AI models—Veo 3 for video, Imagen 4 for images, and Gemini.</li><li>It's currently available for Google AI Pro and Ultra users in the U.S., with Pro getting 100 scene generations a month and Ultra unlocking advanced audio features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Imagine having an awesome movie idea but you have no CGI budget or even a camera crew. It usually means game over, but with Google’s new “Flow” tool, you might not need any of those to bring your vision to life.</p><p>At its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/google-i-o-2025-live-blog">I/O conference</a>, Google announced Flow, a new AI setup built to help storytellers turn big ideas into movie scenes without blowing a ton of cash.</p>
<h2 id="powered-by-google-s-best-ai-2">Powered by Google’s best AI</h2>
<p>Flow is far from being just another video tool. It’s wired to work hand-in-hand with Google’s AI models. It taps into Veo 3 for video, Imagen 4 for images, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> for the smarts behind it all.</p><p>That setup lets you describe scenes in plain English, fine-tune camera angles, and keep characters consistent from shot to shot. It even handles sound effects and dialogue on its own.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-2">How it works</h2>
<p>With Flow, you just type something like "A detective chases a thief through a rainy Tokyo alley" and Veo 3 brings it to life, complete with footsteps, rain sounds, and cinematic lighting.</p><p>You can tweak camera angles, zoom in, or switch perspectives like you're behind the lens. Building scenes is as easy as stacking Legos—add shots, change angles, remix elements, and it all stays consistent.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-57">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Marshall is launching its first soundbar, the Heston 120, with support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.</li><li>Designed for both TV and music, it features 11 drivers for cinematic sound with multi-mode settings (Movie, Music, Voice, Night), including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE with Auracast, HDMI eARC, and RCA inputs.</li><li>The Heston 120 matches Marshall’s signature style with leather and tactile controls, and control via the Marshall app.</li><li>It’s available in June 2025 for $999.99 and only comes in black.</li></ul>
<p>Marshall has been making amplifiers, speakers, headphones, and earbuds for 60 years, but never tried its hand at a soundbar — until now. The Heston 120 marks its first official attempt at building something for the TV and home theater space, taking on the likes of Sonos, Sony, Samsung, Denon, and many others.</p><p>Built for both TV audio and music playback and selling for $999.99, Marshall’s first soundbar measures 43.3 x 5.70 x 2.99 inches (width x depth x height). It will work as a connected device, meaning you will be able to stream audio to it from your phone, tablet, or computer. With Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support, spatial audio is part of the mix as well.</p>
<h2 id="marshall-styling-and-tuning-2">Marshall styling and tuning</h2>
<p>The Heston 120 has 11 “strategically placed” drivers facing in different directions to spread sound out, much like other similar soundbars do. Marshall claims special effects will sound more “lifelike” while deep bass will give both TV audio and music a resonant rumble unto itself.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the brand references both explosions in an action film and the ambience of a live concert recording as key examples of what sets this new soundbar apart from others. Total peak output is 150 watts, so this thing can get pretty loud.</p><p>Marshall also ensures that the Heston 120 stays close to the family as far as how it looks. The wrapped leather trim and brushed metal panel are not unlike its existing speaker lineup, along with the metal knobs designed to emulate the look of an old school Marshall amp.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XQRL3CpSyPyX2eXs5Feoya" name="Marshall-Heston-120-angle" alt="Marshall Heston 120 soundbar in black on a white background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XQRL3CpSyPyX2eXs5Feoya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marshall)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the soundbar will have a form of modularity in that you can repair or replace the fret, end caps, drivers, and circuit boards to extend its lifespan in case anything malfunctions down the line. What’s not clear is how long Marshall intends to offer these replacement parts, especially if it chooses to exit the TV audio category later on.</p><p>The Heston 120 has an HDMI eARC port and HDMI pass-through for TVs and external devices, plus classic RCA analog inputs in case you want to try it with a turntable or legacy components. There’s even an output port for a subwoofer.</p><p>An Ethernet port enables wired access to the home network, though the soundbar can also connect via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (with LE Audio and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me">Auracast</a> support) to stream music wirelessly.</p>
<h2 id="control-through-marshall-app-2">Control through Marshall app</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MM28DuJNbHSteXy58AmL9b" name="Marshall-Heston-120-controls" alt="Marshall Heston 120 soundbar knobs and dials." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MM28DuJNbHSteXy58AmL9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marshall)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The retooled Marshall app lets you control the Heston 120 in much the same way as its other speakers. Settings and features appear to remain similar, where you can manage volume, adjust EQ settings, and customize sound profiles. The app will also offer room calibration to optimize the Heston 120’s acoustics and sound output for whatever space you put it in.</p><p>Outside of the app, Spotify, Tidal, and Airable internet radio will integrate into the app and connected devices as well. For example, the Heston 120 will appear as a streaming option in the Spotify and Tidal apps, along with preset buttons you can apply to it in the Marshall app for quick playback. This way, you can start a playlist or radio station without opening any of those three streaming apps. AirPlay 2 and Chromecast connections also apply here, adding another way to push content over to the soundbar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DQc3iuphcJWSqNMqxyzuwa" name="Marshall-Heston-120-ports" alt="Marshall Heston 120 soundbar ports in the rear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DQc3iuphcJWSqNMqxyzuwa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marshall)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notably missing in this layout is voice control. The two onboard microphones only serve the room calibration feature, so at least for now, you won’t be controlling smart home devices or telling the Heston 120 what you want to hear.</p><p>The Marshall Heston 120 goes on sale starting June 3, 2025 from Marshall.com, for $999.99. It only comes in black, and while you can wall-mount it, the mounts don’t come in the box, so you’ll have to buy them separately. Marshall will also release related products, called Heston 60 and Heston Sub 200 at a later unspecified date.</p>

While that can be a sound strategy, it doesn't always get you the best value. There's no doubt the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> is a solid smartphone for $500, but it can quickly become overshadowed by the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> at the right price.</p><p>Now that early Memorial Day deals are here, the base-model Pixel 9 has finally hit the perfect price. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVCD8R"><strong>It's 25% off at Amazon, bringing the cost under $600 and shaving nearly $200 off the usual sticker price.</strong></a></p><p>I've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/i-spent-weeks-with-the-google-pixel-9a-and-the-pixel-9-you-should-buy-this-one">tested the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9a side-by-side for weeks</a>, and I'm absolutely certain it's worth paying an extra $100 for the full-fledged Pixel 9 instead of settling for the cheaper model.</p>

Early Memorial Day deals bring the Pixel 9 down under $600, and that puts this outstanding device in the same category as budget midrangers like the Pixel 9a and OnePlus 13R. There's really no comparison — the Pixel 9 is a steal at this price point. </p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587819.p?skuId=6587819" target="_blank">Best Buy - $799.99</a> | <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_9" target="_blank">Google Store - $799.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVCD8R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 9:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you value increased performance and on-device AI capabilities; you want a stylish and premium design; you need excellent nighttime photography.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're not willing to pay more than $500; you don't like an over-processed colors; you want the absolute best battery life.</p>
<p>It's easy to think that the Google Pixel 9a and the more-expensive Pixel 9 are too similar, as both have nearly-identical screens and the exact same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 processor</a>. However, there's more to the story. The budget Pixel 9a is the winner in battery capacity, but the more premium Pixel 9 takes the crown in just about every other area. For most people, it's absolutely worth paying only $100 more during this sale to upgrade to the standard Pixel 9.</p>

<p>There are subjective reasons you might want to pick the Pixel 9 over the Pixel 9a, like slimmer display bezels, a premium glass back, and the iconic Pixel camera bar. It's true that the Pixel 9 is the most premium-feeling Pixel generation I've ever used, but design differences are easy to overlook if you're trying to save a few dollars.</p><p>Putting those aside, the concerning part about buying a Pixel 9a for $500 is the phone's longevity. Google equipped the Pixel 9a with just 8GB of RAM, while the rest of the Pixel 9 series gets 12GB of memory. This decision inherently limits the Pixel 9a's potential. While it is guaranteed to get seven years of software support, it's reasonable to expect the cheaper model to miss out on new features due to hardware limitations.</p>

<p>In fact, the Pixel 9a is more limited than the Pixel 9 straight out of the box. The phone's smaller available memory means that it can only run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">the Gemini Nano XXS model</a> instead of the Gemini Nano XS model the Pixel 9 can handle. This has real-world consequences: you won't be able to use handy features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a> on the Pixel 9a.</p><p>These are just the feature omissions on day one, and there will be likely more to follow as Google ships more updates for Pixel phones. AI tasks specifically require a lot of memory for on-device processing, and the Pixel 9a can't handle these as well as the Pixel 9. By paying only $100 more for the Pixel 9 today, you're not just buying the features available today — you're future-proofing your device for all the ones guaranteed to arrive in future Android OS upgrades.</p>

<p>Other benefits, like a 50MP main camera sensor that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">significantly larger the one offered on the Pixel 9a</a>, make the Pixel 9 a slam-dunk purchase at this price point. Keep in mind, the Pixel 9 costs around $800 at full price. When the smartphone is available at its full retail price, it's completely reasonable to save $300 to buy the Pixel 9a instead.</p><p>However, when the difference in price between the Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9a is only $100, it's a no-brainer. The flagship Pixel 9 is the better phone today, and it'll almost certainly last longer and get more new features, too.</p>

<p>Memorial Day is still a week away (May 26th), but Amazon has wasted no time in dropping some of the best Android deals I&apos;ve seen all year. Whether you&apos;re in the market for a new smartphone, wearable, or tablet, I&apos;ve handpicked a bunch of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/memorial-day">Memorial Day deals</a> for Android users so you don&apos;t have to go looking.</p><p>I&apos;m talking about deals like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B0BXYCS74H"><strong>25% off Sony&apos;s WH-1000XM5 headphones,</strong></a> or this promo that gives you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0F2GSNYN5"><strong>$120 off AND a free gift card when you preorder</strong></a> the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. There&apos;s plenty more where those come from, and the best part? Most of the offers included in Amazon&apos;s Memorial Day sale don&apos;t require a Prime membership to enjoy the savings. That being said, most of these deals expire next week, so don&apos;t wait too long if something catches your eye. Let&apos;s dive in. </p>

<p>Don't think anyone had this on their bingo card. Apple steps into Google's limelight to announce info for its upcoming WWDC event.</p><p>Just this morning (May 20), Apple posted a snapshot of its upcoming WWDC 2025 event, stating it will take place on June 9 at 10 am PT (1 pm ET). The company teases folks can tune in to witness its next "software and technologies." With the tagline "On the Horizon," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/">WWDC 2025's official page</a> went live not long ago, giving users a little more insight. The entire event runs from June 9-13.</p><p>Users and developers alike should prepare for Apple's main keynote on June 9 at 10 am PT. However, the page states there will be a "Platform State of the Union" event following the main keynote at 1 pm PT. Apple says it will clue users into the "newest advancements for your apps and games."</p><p>The festivities continue as Apple highlights its Sessions. The page says users will be taken through over 100 videos concerning Apple's design, tech, and tools. Those interested are encouraged to download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958">Apple's Developer app</a> and subscribe to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@AppleDeveloper?sub_confirmation=1">Developer YouTube</a> page.</p><p>Lastly, Apple states users can set up one-on-one lab experiences. These are online appointments that will guide users through topics they find the most interesting. There's more to it; however, Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/sessions-and-labs/#one-on-one-labs">will walk you through</a> how this can be achieved if desired.</p>

<p>WWDC is starting one day earlier than last year, but Apple's 2024 conference <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wwdc-2024-apple-fitness-ai-feature-war-with-samsung">really dug into</a> the brand's AI efforts. The main event talked about Apple Intelligence, which we've all become familiar with in recent months. Apple Intelligence was all about bringing many AI features to assist users daily, similar to what we've seen from Samsung and Google. However, another talking point was how it could improve the health and fitness experience.</p><p>On the other hand, Apple sort of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-made-rcs-messaging-an-afterthought-at-wwdc-why-wouldnt-it">pushed RCS messaging to the back burner</a> last June, which wasn't surprising. Instead of speaking on it in depth, we were given the expectation of RCS in iOS 18, which happened a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">few months later in September</a>. The RCS update finally brought the text message update Android users had been waiting for with iPhones. In short, the update brought read receipts, sharper photos, and more.</p>

<p>For the unaware, Xiaomi first partnered with Qualcomm back in 2011, almost 15 years ago with the launch of its Mi 1. And for the past decade, every flagship from Xiaomi has been comprising the premium Qualcomm chipset, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, which was one of the first handset to feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset. The trend will be continuing for the next 15 years as well.</p><p>Xiaomi has incorporated Qualcomm platforms like the Snapdragon Cockpit platform for its SU7 — the first vehicle launched by the company in 2023. The vehicle also includes Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Auto 5G Modem-RF solution for better processing and precise positioning.</p><p>Furthermore, Xiaomi’s smart home products have been incorporating the chipset maker’s Wi-Fi solutions, including the latest Wi-Fi standards. Wearables from the company, like the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro, are also powered by Snapdragon S7 and S7 Plus Gen 1 sound platforms, while the Watch 2 Pro is equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1</a> wearable platform.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-72">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Motorola and Verizon have delayed the Razr 2025 release without giving much of a reason—just a vague promise of a “better experience.”</li><li>The foldables are now expected to land at Verizon, Visible, Straight Talk, and Total Wireless on May 22 after missing their May 15 schedule.</li><li>A few unlucky buyers are seeing their shipping dates slide even further, now pointing to May 28.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola’s latest Razr lineup was supposed to hit store shelves on May 15, but if you’re grabbing it through certain carriers, you’ll have to wait a bit because the release has been delayed.</p><p>Motorola and Verizon have decided to hit pause on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Razr 2025</a>'s release, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/19/motorola-razr-verizon-delay-rumors/" target="_blank">9to5Google </a>reports. The phone maker and the carrier did not give a concrete explanation behind the decision, leaving everyone puzzled.</p><p>"We adjusted the availability timeline of the new Motorola Razr to ensure the best possible launch experience for our customers," a company representative said in a statement. "It will be available at Verizon, Straight Talk, Total Wireless and Visible on May 22."</p><p>Verizon has also updated its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-motorola-razr-2025-offers" target="_blank">blog post</a> for the lineup's unveiling to show the new launch date, but that’s all the company is saying, with no real explanation yet on what is causing the holdup.</p>
<h2 id="reddit-s-on-fire-kind-of-2">Reddit’s on fire (kind of)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i4xa7xZM9azUCGuBoPCmYU" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-19" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in the Pantone Lightest Sky colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i4xa7xZM9azUCGuBoPCmYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other carriers still have the Razr up for grabs, but over on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razr/comments/1kosm7n/the_razr_2025verizon_mystery_saga/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, some customers are sounding off about shipping delays, and the rumor mill is in full swing trying to figure out what is going on.</p><p>Most people dealing with delays haven’t said which carrier they ordered from, so it’s looking like the issues might just be tied to the four carriers Motorola mentioned. Still, a few are now seeing shipping dates pushed back to May 28.</p><p>The delay is taking place right as some weird rumors start flying, mainly about the Razr 2025 running a little too hot. Nothing has been confirmed, but Reddit is lit up with stories: users who ordered through Total Wireless say their phones got sent back mid-shipment, and a few delivery drivers even refused to drop them off.</p><p>One thread (now deleted) even tossed out fire hazard claims, but most people think that theory is quite a stretch.</p><p>Motorola’s statement might not totally satisfy Razr fans itching to get their hands on the latest models, but the silver lining behind all of this is that the launch is still happening, just pushed back by a week.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'll start by saying that I generally like 8BitDo's products; I bought several controllers from the brand over the years, and they've held up well. A big part of the allure with the brand is the styling; most of its products have a delightful retro aesthetic, and that's even more true of its mechanical keyboard.</p><p>The Retro Mechanical Keyboard has a fabulous design that evokes memories of retro gaming consoles, and 8BitDo did a great job staying true to its design ethos. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Keyboard-Bluetooth-Swappable-Programmable-PC/dp/B0CCP8KYGG">keyboard is available for $89 on Amazon</a>, and it is sold in four editions. I'm using the N Edition, and you can pick up the C64 Edition, Fami Edition, or the M Edition. The feature-set is identical with all the models, and the only difference is the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="eAxj7Hnh47eBJA5b8REfeL" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eAxj7Hnh47eBJA5b8REfeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4896" height="2758" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The N Edition is styled to resemble the NES, and it looks fantastic; the design is a definite differentiator, and 8BitDo did all the right things in this area. The keyboard has a power button on the right that light up when it's connected, and you get dials to switch between modes; there's Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity in addition to the standard USB-C.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x6kxuLgSQSCVxvuC7enq5L" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6kxuLgSQSCVxvuC7enq5L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are physical buttons to pair the keyboard, and I set it up with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> in addition to testing it with my Windows machine. There are no problems whatsoever with connectivity, and 8BitDo's unique 2.4GHz receiver slots into a magnetic cubby at the back, ensuring you don't lose it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4928px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="asZqStKTjLP77MJJEFSEoK" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asZqStKTjLP77MJJEFSEoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4928" height="2775" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The keyboard uses an aluminum plate, but the chassis itself is made out of plastic. I don't mind the plastic build (it is a faithful recreation, after all), and the build quality itself is pretty good. Coming in at 1050g, the keyboard isn't particularly heavy, but it stays planted on a table thanks to rubber feet on the underside.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZhbrNBGscC7BqnN5hbxtvK" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZhbrNBGscC7BqnN5hbxtvK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the dual knobs to switch between modes and adjust the volume; they have a decidedly retro flair. The keys are similarly great, with 8BitDo using dye-sublimated PBT keys with a custom MDA profile. Another interesting inclusion is a set of buttons — dubbed the Super Buttons — that you can connect to the keyboard via custom connectors. You get one set of buttons in the package, and you can easily connect three additional sets. The buttons are programmable, so you can set up macros or launch a program with relative ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cMGwDWZX3bKq2tPJj4bSqK" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cMGwDWZX3bKq2tPJj4bSqK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to most keyboards today, 8BitDo went with a TKL design — you miss out on the dedicated number pad. That said, if you need a full-size model, that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Keyboard-Integrated-Bluetooth-Swappable-Wireless/dp/B0DKXH5WCD">edition is available for $115</a> — and it retails the same design. The TKL model has the standard 87 keys, and it is available in ISO configurations.</p>

<p>The keyboard comes with Kailh Box V2 White switches as standard, and the pre-lubed clicky switch is <em>loud </em>— it's similar to the Cherry MX Blue in this regard. The switch has a 45gF actuation and 3.9mm total travel, and it feels wonderful to use. I generally prefer Gateron's linear switches, and the feel of these Kailh switches is totally different.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Gta2ZJpLQLXhk9KJxqWQkK" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gta2ZJpLQLXhk9KJxqWQkK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, if you need a mechanical keyboard with quiet switches, this isn't the one to get. Of course, you can easily take out the switches and use your own if you want — the keyboard takes standard 3- and 5-pin MX switches. While it doesn't have VIA, 8BitDo's software does a decent enough job, and it is easy to program buttons and macros.</p>

<p>Now, the biggest limitation with the keyboard is that it doesn't have backlighting. I get that some brands don't want to include RGB lighting on their keyboards, but there isn't any backlight whatsoever with this model, and that is annoying. 8BitDo should have at least used white LEDs to accentuate the design, because as it stands, the keyboard isn't that usable in a dark room.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="K3DjJ8EhwTF3KiZDFVUHNL" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K3DjJ8EhwTF3KiZDFVUHNL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would have liked a metal chassis as it usually delivers better acoustics, but the choice of switch mitigates that issue to an extent. Outside of that, I don't have any problems with the Retro Mechanical Keyboard. The keyboard has a 2,000mAh battery, and 8BitDo touts 200 hours of usage between charges. That's because of the fact that it doesn't have any backlighting, and in my usage, I got two weeks of usage out of a charge, and that's considerably more than any other keyboard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="DwiBf3xsntJk9nPJwkZKmK" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DwiBf3xsntJk9nPJwkZKmK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5092" height="2868" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the Retro Mechanical Keyboard has one of the best designs of any keyboard I have in the house (and I have over 30 boards), and the versatile connectivity makes it a breeze to use it with just about any device. It's annoying that there's no backlighting, but if you don't mind the omission and want a keyboard that celebrates the glorious era of retro gaming, you should buy it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Stuffcool is the brand to go with if you need reliable charging products made in India, and I used most of its power banks and chargers released over the last four years. Its latest addition is the Maverick Mini, a 20,000mAh power bank with 20W charging. While that's pretty standard these days, what gives the Maverick Mini an edge is that it has built-in USB-C as well as Lightning cables.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5129px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pmFfDXWeFedF5PpbfkRvqU" name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini" alt="Stuffcool Maverick Mini review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pmFfDXWeFedF5PpbfkRvqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5129" height="2889" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power bank is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Maverick-Powerbank-Lightning-Charging/dp/B0DZHKBBM1">available for ₹2,299 ($27) on Amazon India</a>, and it's a decent value when you consider the design and build quality. The Maverick Mini is considerably smaller than the brand's traditional power banks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-major-ultra-review">Major Ultra</a>, and in this regard, it takes after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-giga-is-the-indian-brands-best-65w-power-bank-yet">Giga 65W model</a>. The smaller size makes it that much easier to take anywhere, and at 322g, it isn't too heavy either.</p>

<p>There are no issues taking the 77Wh battery on a flight, and what I like the most about the Maverick Mini is the built-in cables; while I used several power banks that have an integrated USB-C cable, the inclusion of the Lightning cable is a nice addition, and it gives the power bank much better versatility.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rGueG5spnKL7bsFE7T7zqU" name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini" alt="Stuffcool Maverick Mini review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rGueG5spnKL7bsFE7T7zqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get two standard ports as well, a USB-C and USB-A, and the latter goes up to 22.5W and can be used to charge various phones and accessories. The power bank works with USB PD PPS at up to 22W, so if you've got a Samsung phone, this is a decent choice. Both the USB-C and Lightning ports go up to 20W individually, and while it isn't the fastest power bank by Stuffcool, you're basically getting plenty of convenience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5110px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="tWmzQtEuijEEPpoXAgcztU" name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini" alt="Stuffcool Maverick Mini review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tWmzQtEuijEEPpoXAgcztU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5110" height="2878" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The internal battery charges at 18W, and it takes over two hours to charge. What's great in this area is that there's a tiny panel on the side that serves as the battery level indicator, and it definitely comes in handy. The build quality itself is pretty good, and I didn't see any issues in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LmwA3fCejmGtCSfVJ7sTxU" name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini" alt="Stuffcool Maverick Mini review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmwA3fCejmGtCSfVJ7sTxU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The one quibble with the design is that the glossy coat picks up smudges with relative ease, and I would have liked a matte texture or better coating; UGREEN's Nexode power bank does a great job, but it's six times costlier. I used the power bank with the Vivo X200 Pro and Steam Deck, and it delivered a consistent charge.</p>

<p>Affordability is a key selling point of the Maverick Mini, and the smaller size makes it easier to carry around in a bag. While I'm not using iPhones that still have the Lightning port, it is a good choice nonetheless, and it is just as consistent at charging as the USB-C port.</p><p>If you want a power bank that has integrated cables and a 20,000mAh battery, the Maverick Mini is a decent choice. A similar model with 65W charging would be a great addition to Stuffcool's portfolio, so let's see if the brand releases that next. Until then, the Maverick Mini is a good starting point.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I liked what Synology did with the BeeStation; it delivered an easier-to-use network storage product that makes it easier for those looking to store photos and documents in a centralized location. WD's My Cloud catered to this category for close to a decade, so it was good to see Synology coming up with a rival.</p><p>The brand showcased the BeeStation Plus with 8TB of storage at the start of the year, and the model is now available globally. You can buy it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://B0F43Z4SBS">for $459 on Amazon in the U.S.</a> (with deliveries starting June 10), and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bee.synology.com/en-uk/BeeStation/Plus-8TB">selling for £386 in the U.K.</a> via the brand's website. To put things into context, the regular BeeStation with 4TB storage is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Synology-BeeStation-Personal-Storage-BST150-4T/dp/B0CSSR38F1">available for $219</a>, so you're basically paying double.</p><p>What do you get for that price, you ask? The BeeStation Plus has double the amount of storage at 8TB, and the fact that it has an integrated HDD makes it that much more convenient. You get all the same features as the standard model, including an AI-backed photo management, and you get easy file management with the ability to connect to public cloud providers like Google Drive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:763px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.01%;"><img id="4qZ4oUBUM6cTpHTUjetFoH" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4qZ4oUBUM6cTpHTUjetFoH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="763" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Synology)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's not all though, as the BeeStation Plus also comes with a native Plex client. The ability to store TV shows and movies and stream them to all devices on your home network is a huge advantage, and this is a key omission on the regular BeeStation. So if you need a no-frills Plex media server that does the basics, the BeeStation Plus is a strong candidate.</p><p>The best part is that as the BeeStation Plus is powered by Intel's Celeron J4125 platform, you get hardware transcoding as well — something that's not available on the DiskStation DS923+. The product comes with 4GB of RAM installed as standard, and there's a single Gigabit Ethernet port alongside the usual USB-C and USB-A connectivity.</p><p>I'll be testing the BeeStation Plus in the coming weeks, but if you're just interested in a centralized storage solution with integrated Plex and 8TB of storage, this is looking like a pretty good deal.</p>

Some people prefer to leave their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">favorite Android smartphone</a> at home while running, hiking, and cycling. Others use an armband or a fancy hip belt, and a bunch do things the old fashioned way by using their hand or pockets to bring a phone along.</p><p>As a runner with a thousand-plus miles tracked with either a smartwatch or smartphone, I haven't found any of these options to be particularly satisfying. That is, until I started testing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr 2025</a> — a clamshell foldable that's half the height of a normal Android smartphone when closed. Suddenly, holding a phone that fits comfortably in the palm of your hand isn't so bad on a long run.</p>

<p>Often, the conversation about flip phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is that they come with a handful of compromises. These devices don't feature the same camera quality, durability, or battery capacity as traditional handsets, for example.</p><p>However, their compactness can be more of an advantage than a compromise, and that's what I learned using the Razr 2025 as a running buddy — one that added convenience <em>and</em> saved me money.</p>

<h2 id="all-the-benefits-of-carrying-a-phone-with-few-drawbacks-2">All the benefits of carrying a phone, with few drawbacks</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="utNZwugWxm9BMYPk2XXhXK" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-25" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 showing the new run screen on the Nike Run Club app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/utNZwugWxm9BMYPk2XXhXK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The downsides to carrying your phone with you while working out are obvious. They're big and heavy, which can affect your balance and arm motion. If you end up dropping it, or it falls out of your pocket, that could be a $1,000 device hitting the pavement. With that being said, the risks of <em>not</em> carrying a phone with you could be more dangerous — there's no way to get hold of people in the event of an emergency.</p><p>That's why it's simply a good idea to have at least one LTE-enabled device with you while working out, whether it be a phone or a smartwatch. I use a variety of smartwatches to track my runs, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> and the Apple Watch Ultra. The problem is that to use these devices with cellular, I'll need to pay an extra carrier fee that ends up coming out to $15 more per month on my AT&T plan.</p><p>Chances are, if you're a fitness-minded Android user, you probably have a smartwatch. You might even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatch-lte">have one with LTE connectivity</a>. But those extra costs add up, and I wanted to find out if there was a better way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uC3XEFqxredRCxRTznDNLT" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-18" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in the Pantone Lightest Sky colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uC3XEFqxredRCxRTznDNLT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sure enough, I'm convinced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> can be a more useful and cost-effective way to get LTE connectivity on your runs than paying for cell service on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatch</a>. With a tiny phone tucked in your waistband, pocket, or even held in your hand, you can get data on your phone and watch for zero extra dollars.</p><p>For me, carrying a flip phone along with my smartwatch created a better experience than using either a traditional smartphone or an LTE-enabled watch. You get all the benefits of having your phone with you, despite it being roughly half the size of a normal device. That means you can clutch it completely in the palm of your hand, or put it deep in your pockets to reduce bounce, and the risk of a phone falling out while moving.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZznN6TyJd5CaZ5rP6zbwxF" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-21" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 opened up on the Nike Run Club interface." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZznN6TyJd5CaZ5rP6zbwxF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, you can always open up the phone when you need it. That's the great part about the compact form factor of flip phones like the Razr or Galaxy Z Flip. They're small when you need something tiny, and offer the same screen size as a normal flagship when you need something bigger.</p><p>I've never been able to run comfortably carrying traditional smartphones — and I've tried ones from almost every brand — but using a flip phone changed my experience for the better. If you're a runner and carry an LTE-enabled smartwatch instead of your phone, switching to a clamshell foldable and ditching the extra LTE plan could save you money while improving utility.</p>
<h2 id="find-your-use-case-for-flip-phones-2">Find your use case for flip phones</h2>
<p>Running just happened to be the key use case that made clamshell foldables massively appealing to me, but chances are, it'll be different for you. Everyone is going to have their own reason for preferring the versatile form factor. Photographers and content creators might like having a built-in tripod wherever they go, and YouTube fans might love watching videos with a built-in phone stand.</p><p>The point is, if you're considering a compact foldable, get creative. Think about what killer use case that's personal to you might be made possible by the form factor. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable phones</a> can do a lot of things regular phones can't — like tagging along with me on a run without being a nuisance — and that's part of their appeal.</p>

I tested these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/torras-rolls-out-the-best-looking-iphone-16-pro-max-cases-yet">colorful cases with the iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> and enjoyed using them quite a bit; they have bright designs, reliable protection, and a built-in kickstand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pZFtzCrTMqkudXRmgQNAJH" name="Pitaka Tactile Woven Case" alt="Pitaka Tactile Woven Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pZFtzCrTMqkudXRmgQNAJH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, they add bulk to the device, so I when I need a thin case that still provides protection for my iPhone 16 Pro Max, I turn to Pitaka's Tactile Woven cases. Coming in at just 17.95g, it doesn't add any noticeable weight to the phone, and at just 0.8mm thick, it is one of the thinnest cases I've used yet. The case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Pitaka-iPhone-Pro-Max-Compatible/dp/B0DB5SYWY1/">costs $59 on Amazon</a>, and Pitaka also sells the same designs with the iPhone 16 Pro.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Thinborne cases I use with my Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and as an added bonus, you get interesting designs — I used the Sunset and Moonrise models, and there are seven color options available in total. As the name suggests, the case is woven from aramid fiber, and it delivers a textured finish that makes it easy to hold the device.</p>

<p>The case has a raised front to ensure the panel doesn't take any damage when the phone takes a tumble face-down. You get the usual cutouts around the USB-C charging port, power and action buttons along with the volume rocker, and the Camera Control button that's new this year. Although the case itself is sleek, it retains built-in magnets, and I didn't see any issues using the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a slate of Qi 2 chargers, including Satechi's new OntheGo line.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YWDGJNWfXfrULCe5adKN4H" name="Pitaka Tactile Woven Case" alt="Pitaka Tactile Woven Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YWDGJNWfXfrULCe5adKN4H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The back also has decent protection around the cameras thanks to raised edges, and after six months of extensive use, I didn't see any signs of wear on the case. While I used several cases that are made out of aramid, Pitaka's colorful designs allow its Tactile Woven cases to stand out quite a bit, and that's a key selling point.</p>

<p>The best part about the case is the durability; even though it has an ultra-sleek design, the Tactile Woven case provides the same level of protection. After a half-dozen tumbles, I don't see any damage on my iPhone 16 Pro Max, and the case does a great job safeguarding the panel as well — I don't use a screen protector.</p>

<p>There's no shortage of case choices with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but if you want an ultra-thin option that doesn't add much bulk to the phone and still want an interesting design, Pitaka's Tactile Woven case is an easy recommendation.</p>

<p><em><strong>Bob (and others) have asked:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I've had three Galaxy Z Folds and they all cracked down the middle. I understand it is a problem, but will it ever be rectified?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>It's one of those messages you hate to read; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> break a lot more often and for what seems like no reason. Can this ever be less of a problem?</p><p>The quick answer is that phones or other devices that use any sort of super-thin glass that folds will always be more fragile than ones that don't. No magic can change that, but they should be getting more durable every year — probably not for the reason you think, though.</p><p>The entire problem is the thin glass. To have glass that can bend over and over without breaking, it's got to be thinner than a human hair and treated with a special series of coatings. It's amazing, but by its very nature, it's also extremely fragile.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eZMbqLPJZHZ5vhMQoWS4WR" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-3-display-crease-screen-protector-damage-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 3 screen protector wear and tear after 10 months' usage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eZMbqLPJZHZ5vhMQoWS4WR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-glass-bend">Making glass bend</a> is about a lot more than the glass. New methods will surely make a more durable sheet of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-video-shows-ultra-thin-glass-tested">Ultra-Thin-Glass</a> in the future, but the biggest way to alleviate the issue is through the design of the phone itself.</p><p>Very thin glass has a very low tensile strength, meaning that any defect — i.e., a scratch, a nick, or a crack — will lead to catastrophic failure eventually. A folding phone with a blemish on the glass will split right down the crease every time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XV23Wsd8DPotZ3goTWfteY" name="xiaomi-mix-fold-2-review-7.jpg" alt="Xiaomi MIX Fold 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XV23Wsd8DPotZ3goTWfteY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The solution is to do everything possible to keep the screen from being inadvertently damaged. That's why there's a plastic coating on the glass and a plastic permanent screen protector. It's also why foldable phones don't truly fold in half, and the two sides never touch. When all is said and done, though, the hinge is the single most important part of the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KcvdL8WdBxXv4PPERmPsXT" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-titanium-hinge" alt="Razr Ultra 2025 titanium hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcvdL8WdBxXv4PPERmPsXT.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having all the plastic (which feels much better now than it did just a few years ago, because science) in place is easy to figure out. If a piece of dirt from your pocket weasels its way near the screen, it should scratch the plastic layer and leave the glass alone.</p><p>That's also why it's built so that the two sides don't meet when it's closed. You don't want the screen to rub against itself, so the phone folds a tiny bit less than 180 degrees, and there is a small lip around the edge of the phone's body.</p><p>This prevents tiny scratches. It's also why you should never push anything except the soft end of your finger onto a folding phone's screen; your fingernail or something hard could dent the glass through the plastic coatings. Yes, it's that thin.</p>
<p>But again, the most important and probably most difficult part of the design is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pete-lau-teasing-oneplus-fold">the hinge</a>. Imagine if a folding phone's hinge had a little bit of side-to-side wiggle, and what that would do to the edge of a really thin sheet of glass. It would cause a tear along the edge, and that spells the end of the line for your display in short order.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Gfr9eqkpTKvJ8MzSobiY7Y" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-28" alt="A side view of the Motorola Razr 2025 hanging off a park bench." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gfr9eqkpTKvJ8MzSobiY7Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the flip side (see what I did there?) the hinge has to be easy to operate the way it should. it has to fold smoothly without much force yet stay rigidly in place when it is open. Any movement can create a tiny crack that kills your foldable.</p><p>Nobody seems to appreciate the work being done here enough, except the people doing it. The hinge design is 100% why you can have a folding phone in the first place, and as they get better, reports of busted screens become less common — remember the first Galaxy Z Fold and all the pictures on social media of broken ones?</p>
<p>Foldables will never be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-phones">MIL-SPEC tough</a> or rugged devices, and we probably wouldn't even want a thick, bulky 20-ounce phone anyway. But they are getting better and will keep getting better as more work is done to keep everything moving only the way it's supposed to move.</p>

The clue dropped in a YouTube video where the design team broke down what they’re after, though they’re still keeping the name a mystery.</p><p>The teaser is fresh off Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://international.kef.com/blogs/news/nothing-kef-audio-partnership" target="_blank">team-up with audio gear company KEF</a>. The London-based company is mum on the specs for now, but it's a safe bet that we can expect the headphones to arrive this summer.</p><p>Although Nothing is silent about the details for its first over-ear headphones, teaming up with KEF tells us one thing: these will definitely be its most expensive audio gear yet.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyrrLa2zdLg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Still, a few standout hints slipped through. In the teaser’s opener, the design crew jokes about the tag “XM6," a cheeky nod to Sony’s word-salad title for its premium headphones, the WH-1000XM6.</p><p>So, it looks like Nothing is gunning for high-end sound but keeping the price tag down where regular consumers can still snag a pair.</p>
<h2 id="no-more-button-fumbles-2">No more button fumbles</h2>
<p>While riffing on Sony’s new WH-1000XM6, Nothing’s design crew didn’t pull punches, basically saying most over-ear headphones out there are a yawn when it comes to looks. The company also side-eyed the wallet-busting price tags and how you end up fumbling for buttons once the cans are clamped on your head.</p><p>Nothing’s designers want these over-ears to sort of shout your style the second you put them on. They’re dialing in the feel-by-touch controls so you always hit the right button blind.</p>
<h2 id="sound-that-clowns-pricier-pairs-2">Sound that clowns pricier pairs</h2>
<p>More importantly, Nothing is promising sound that punches way above its price class and, maybe, even embarrasses a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">fan-favorite wireless headphones</a>.</p><p>When price came up, one designer mouthed the number, but Nothing bleeped the sound and blurred their lips. So, yes, the sticker shock information stays under wraps for now.</p>

<p>Google is rolling out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/googles-popular-find-my-device-gets-a-revamp-and-notable-enhancements">redesigned Find Hub app</a> for Android users today, following its announcement at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">The Android Show: I/O Edition</a> last week. The change is becoming available following a Google Play Store update for the app, which was previously named Find My Device. Find Hub better reflects the app's capabilities, as it can track devices, items, and people.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.adm&hl=en_US&pli=1" target="_blank">Google Play Store listing</a> now reflects the name change, so you'll need to search for Find Hub to update your app. The latest version number for Find Hub is <strong>3.1.337-2</strong>, and after applying the update, you'll see the switch. Google used to shorten Find My Device to Find Device on the home screen, but now Find Hub is used everywhere.</p><p>Alongside the tweak, the <strong>People</strong> tab in the Find Hub app is out of beta following a testing period. You'll now see separate settings pages for Find Hub and Google Location Sharing when tapping your profile picture in the app after updating.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/find/" target="_blank">official website</a> still uses the Find My Device branding rather than the newer Find Hub moniker.</p><p>These minor changes are just the start of Find Hub updates set to arrive on Android devices. Later this month, the app will gain precise finding for ultra-wideband (UWB) item trackers, which will first become available on the Moto Tag. After that, Find Hub is going to support satellite connectivity starting later this year.</p><p>It's possible that we learn more about Find Hub changes at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-i-o-2025-live-blog">Google I/O 2025</a>, a developer conference happening this week.</p>

<p>At a glance, it would be difficult to tell the difference between the Motorola Razr 2025 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> model it replaces. The two phones' dimensions are nearly identical, with the newer model being slightly thinner, slightly shorter, and slightly lighter. The design changes made to the Razr 2025 are so minute that older cases will still fit — we're talking about fractions of a millimeter here.</p><p>So, what's new about the Razr 2025? There are some new colors and finish options, and I tested Pantone Lightest Sky, which is an ivory-like colorway with a refractor design. However, the major design improvements are under-the-hood upgrades you won't be able to see.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5W3kTBBVmohVQc4hcp486c" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-8" alt="A close-up of the Motorola Razr 2025's main display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5W3kTBBVmohVQc4hcp486c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big news is that the Razr's dust-resistance rating is back after the 2024 series' IPX8 certification forewent dust protection. Now, the Razr 2025 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">IP48 certified</a> against dust and liquid ingress, and that's massive for durability. Dust-resistance is specifically important for foldables, since any kind of debris getting in the hinge or under the display could be fatal for your device.</p><p>The other key design upgrade goes hand-in-hand with the IP48 rating, and that's the titanium-reinforced hinge. Past Motorola foldables utilized a stainless steel hinge, and it simply wasn't good enough compared to foldables from the likes of Samsung. Now, the hinge feels sturdier, stronger, and more satisfying to open and shut. Compared to the weaker hinge on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a>, the difference is night and day.</p>

<p>There aren't any other design changes to speak of, but that's not a bad thing. The base-model Razr's design was already solid. The 3.6-inch pOLED panel is plenty bright, and let's be honest, anything more than the 90Hz refresh rate supported by the cover screen would be overkill. On the inside, the 6.9-inch AMOLED is gorgeous with a 120Hz refresh rate and 3,000 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>The foldable display crease is still visible, and it might feel odd to slide your finger across it for the first time. But that awkwardness fades away quickly. Although there are no new display upgrades on the Razr 2025, this still feels like a fantastic set of screens for a $700 foldable.</p>

<p>While the Razr 2025 technically has a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a> processor, the performance improvements may be in name only. It's still a 4nm chip, and our benchmark tests revealed that the Razr 2025 actually performs worse than the Razr 2024. Not by enough of a margin to matter, but it's worth pointing out. Also, keep in mind that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/benchmarks-are-horrible-way-gauge-performance-smartphone-and-heres-why">benchmarks don't really tell the whole story</a> when using a phone, so take what you will from these numbers.</p>

<p>There were a handful of times when I noticed the Razr 2025 lag behind, and the common denominator seemed to be fast multitasking paired with excessive heat. If I bring the smartphone outdoors in Arizona heat while streaming music, taking photos and videos, and browsing the web, the Razr 2025 might stutter here and there.</p><p>These were all minor, momentary hiccups — this foldable is by no means <em>slow</em>. But if you expect it to perform like a flagship, you'll end up a bit disappointed. The benchmark results show that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> are running laps around the base model I tested.</p><p>Meanwhile, with a 4,500mAh battery, the Razr 2025 consistently lasted a full day, which is excellent for a clamshell foldable.</p>

<p>The Razr 2025's main camera is still a 50MP, f/1.7 sensor, and it performs well in most situations. Motorola touts that this smartphone offers Pantone Validated Color and Skin Tones, which should help your Razr 2025's camera capture accurate and lifelike colors.</p><p>This ended up being mostly the case, but you'll notice in the camera samples below that Motorola's High Dynamic Range (HDR) processing can be a bit aggressive. For example, while the sunset photos and the restaurant signs I captured seem to really pop, the colors are definitely oversaturated compared to what I saw in the real world.</p>

<p>There's a lot of post-processing magic going on here, because when it doesn't work right, it's noticeable. The night skyline in the sixth photo above seemed to give the Razr 2025 trouble, because it ended up being a grainy and blurry mess.</p><p>The main camera is joined by a 13MP ultrawide lens, which is also unchanged this year. By default, you can shoot in 0.5x, 1x, and 2x zoom lengths, and anything further will heavily rely on digital zoom. Unfortunately, there's no telephoto lens.</p>

<p>To be clear, the Motorola Razr 2025's camera isn't bad. It's actually quite good when you consider that this is a space-constrained foldable at a midrange price point. However, I would've liked to see less-aggressive color science and a more natural look to some of the photos.</p>

<p>There's no avoiding the fact that the Razr 2025 is overloaded with AI. There are at least four AI suites offered on this smartphone: Moto AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, Perplexity, and Copilot. If you don't want to use any of these AI features, that's perfectly fine. The Moto AI features require a Motorola account, so just stay signed out if you'd rather not see them. Plus, it's quick and easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/first-things-to-do-with-the-motorola-razr-2025-series">change the double-press of the home button</a> from an AI launcher to a camera launcher.</p><p>I personally didn't enjoy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI experience</a> on the Razr 2025, mostly because the device is too underpowered to process AI queries in a fast and secure manner. For instance, Catch Me Up — a feature that summarizes your notifications — needs to send them to a cloud server for processing before you can get the low-down on what you missed. Not only is the delay inconvenient, the cloud processing could be a privacy concern.</p><p>For what it's worth, Motorola says data sent to its cloud servers is always encrypted, and that data won't be shared with third-party AI assistant apps. That won't be enough for everyone to trust the service, however.</p>

<p>You should know that it's incredibly easy to use the Razr 2025 without ever touching an AI feature, so these criticisms shouldn't be a dealbreaker. The truth is, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> is an excellent AI assistant, and it's all I need. For me, the standard Gemini experience is enough to forget about Moto AI, Perplexity, and Copilot.</p><p>What <em>may</em> be a dealbreaker is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">the Razr 2025's software support window</a>. It covers just three years of Android OS upgrades and an extra year of security updates. That's short compared to other phones in this price range from Google and Samsung. Motorola's track record of shipping timely and bug-free software updates isn't great, either, although it has improved some as of late.</p>

<p>My final nitpick is that the rear camera lenses are a dust and fingerprint magnet due to how far they protrude from the screen. Be prepared to clean them often, especially if you use cover screen apps in full-screen mode.</p>

Usually, I'd recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-2025-razr-makes-me-like-last-years-model-even-more">picking up the older model</a> and saving a few bucks, but not this time. By picking the Razr 2024, you'll get one fewer OS upgrade (since the first was used for Android 15), no dust resistance, a smaller battery, and a weaker hinge. The savings aren't worth what you'd have to give up.</p>
<p>If you have a Razr Plus 2023 or older, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-makes-me-and-my-razr-plus-2023-jealous">the base Razr 2025 will surprisingly be worth the upgrade</a>. It's brighter and way more durable, while offering longer battery life and the same or bigger screen sizes than older models.</p><p>The expensive Galaxy Z Flip 6 isn't in the same price point as the Razr 2025, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">rumored Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a> — a cheaper Samsung clamshell — might be.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Gfr9eqkpTKvJ8MzSobiY7Y" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-28" alt="A side view of the Motorola Razr 2025 hanging off a park bench." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gfr9eqkpTKvJ8MzSobiY7Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a compact and versatile phone with few compromises</li><li>You need a brand-new phone priced at well under $1,000</li><li>You want a foldable with unrestricted cover screen access</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need more than three years of Android OS upgrades</li><li>You find Moto AI more of a nuisance than a helper</li><li>You want a larger and more useful cover screen</li></ul>
<p>There are more than a few reasons to stop and think about whether the Motorola Razr 2025's compromises are worth it. Motorola's sketchy track record with software updates concerns me, and the three-year OS update promise falls short of modern expectations. Moto AI might not be as secure as you'd like, and the cover screen is less capable than the one you'll find on a Plus or Ultra model.</p><p>When all is said and done, I think all these points are forgivable when you consider the Razr 2025's affordable price of entry. Paying $700 or less for a phone sure to last you <em>at least</em> four years is a pretty solid deal. Even if you have the money to spend on a more expensive phone, the Razr 2025 finds a value sweet spot. None of the missing features from the Plus 2025 or Ultra 2025 variants significantly hamper the experience.</p><p>If I had carte blanche to choose a clamshell foldable, I'd choose the Motorola Razr 2025 because of its stellar price-to-performance ratio.</p>

With a bigger battery, newer processor, and key durability improvements, a great entry-level foldable phone gets even better. </p></p>

Veteran developers and VR publisher Creature just debuted four brand new games in its Creature Feature showcase on IGN, plus a handful of other titles that you will be looking forward to once you see them.</p><p>While most of these games are VR-only, two of them are also making their debut on non-VR systems in the very near future. But all of them are playable on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, which means all you'll need to do is wishlist these and get excited for the future!</p>

<p>Seemingly, everyone loves the Nintendo classic Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon series, and Adepts banks on that feeling of nostalgia and elemental charm to immediately draw players into its gorgeous world. But you won't be The Avatar in this game. Rather, you're a powerful Earth Adept soldier who can unearth the rocks all around them in martial combat.</p><p>As you progress through the story, you'll unlock new powers as you achieve mastery over your earth powers. Adepts Arena is a single-player adventure, despite what the name might imply, so no PvP earth bending action just yet.</p><p>This one is debuting on the Meta Quest in VR (obviously), but is also going to be available on Steam with VR and flat screen support. Non-VR Steam gamers will control it like a traditional FPS, while VR gamers are treated to an immersive, active martial arts-style simulation. If you've ever wanted to weave the ways of the Earth Benders from Avatar, this is looking to be your best bet when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://giantstridegames.com/adepts-arena_en.php">hopefully debuts later this year</a>!</p>

<p>Next up is a multiplayer-focused co-op horror game that'll keep you running as fast as possible through haunted mines in an effort to try to deliver as many packages as possible. You and up to three other human-controlled goblins will take on dangerous shifts to deliver packages come Hell or high water. Hey, no one said being a Prime delivery person was easy!</p><p>Of course, things aren't as straightforward as delving down and dropping packages at doorsteps. Traps are laid along the way to prevent intruders of all kinds, and not all goblins are the nice kind, either. This is the game I'm most excited about in the whole showcase, as I'm just imagining all the fun I'll be having with friends on a Friday evening.</p><p>Check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/deadly-delivery/8778947438836641/">Meta Quest page</a> for more info and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadlydelivery.com/">the official website</a> to sign up for the closed beta!</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">Dungeons of Eternity</a> is one of my favorite VR games of all time, but wouldn't it be nice to get a change of scenery every once in a while? Crossings, a new game by the folks who brought us the Budget Cuts series — some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Quest games</a> ever — are back with a new co-op action-adventure roguelite that'll test your skills with the blade in a way I've only ever seen from the VR classic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/until-you-fall-review">Until You Fall</a>.</p><p>As you'd expect from a roguelite, each level and area is procedurally generated to deliver a new experience every time. Unlike most roguelites, however, your only goal isn't just to become stronger. In Crossings, you'll delve into a story of the Norse afterlife, finding hidden stories and rebuilding the memory of your lost village. In essence, it sounds more like a mix of Hades story-heavy quest and the near-storyless world of Dungeons of Eternity rolled into one title.</p><p>Crossings can be played single-player or with friends, ensuring that you can enjoy the game even if your friends aren't available. A demo is coming to Steam Next Fest in June with a full release on Steam and Meta Quest later this year.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought about how you could make the word "rose" from the word "rooster?" Or maybe turning the word "pineapple" into two different words, "apple" and "pen?" It's these strange questions that keep us up at night that led to the creation of Wordbound, a fantastic new mixed reality word game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kettle.games/">coming soon to the Meta Quest platform</a>.</p><p>Each level features a visual puzzle that needs to be solved by deconstructing the available objects into their letters, then rearranging them into the solution object. In one scene, a bowl of three apples needs a fourth to be full, so you deconstruct a plane and a pig, sort the letters, then smash them together to make an apple. It's a brilliant concept that can be played entirely one-handed, so you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-casual-meta-quest-games">wake up and chill</a> with a great brain starter.</p>

<p>John Williams might be the person you think of as the "Star Wars maestro," but a new Maestro in town might just be a Duel of the Fates you've always wanted. That's right, Star Wars is coming to Maestro, one of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/two-meta-quest-rhythm-games-that-rival-beat-saber">favorite VR rhythm games of all time</a>, and the DLC includes none other than the Duel of the Fates track by John Williams, plus a new environment and even a cool little lightsaber baton to conduct with.</p><p>It'll be available on June 20 when the game also launches on PSVR 2 for the first time.</p>

<p>Check out the full Creature Feature Showcase above to see everything else that was announced, including an updated release date for Laser Dance, preorder discounts on Prison Boss Prohibition, the latest Light Brigade update, and news about Thrasher coming to flat screen systems.</p><p>And you can't forget about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/starship-home-mixed-reality-game-impressions">Starship Home</a>, which debuted last Fall and remains one of the coolest, most convincing mixed reality games you can play today. Creature is launching a vinyl soundtrack from the game soon, letting you chill out to the vaporwave tunes after you've landed your starship.</p>

<hr>
<p>Qualcomm seems to have put some chatter to rest after it announced at Computex 2025 that the next Snapdragon Summit will take place this September. It will be a two-day summit held between Sept. 23 and 25 in Hawaii (first reported by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-confirms-late-September-launch-for-Snapdragon-8-Elite-2.1019401.0.html"> Notebook Check</a>).</p><p>According to the publication, "there's a good chance we could see the next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Snapdragon-X-Elite-2-New-rumour-predicts-up-to-a-22-performance-uplift.999825.0.html">Snapdragon X Elite 2</a> (or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-X2-Elite-Leak-reveals-chip-with-18-cores-48-GB-RAM-and-support-for-graphics-cards.971101.0.html">Snapdragon X2 Elite</a>) laptop chips debut here."</p><p>Several rumors that we saw around April this year also indicated that Qualcomm is working on a "Snapdragon 8 Elite 2," and its reveal could occur earlier toward the end of September.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.44%;"><img id="XjRF5FYu5b2mruEqArEGQh" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjRF5FYu5b2mruEqArEGQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1682" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 is expected to be more potent than the first-generation chipset. The website adds that it will keep its 6 + 2 CPU configuration and use an Adreno GPU that is up to 30% faster and has a 26% higher AnTuTu score.</p><p>It is important to note that despite having a rumored same "internal schedule" to launch the chip, the second-gen Elite is expected to show up a month earlier than its predecessor, which was launched in October last year.</p><p>Other rumors have indicated that the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 could achieve 5GHz speeds for its main core and is tipped to come with Qualcomm's "enhanced Pegasus cores." The chip may come paired with the Adreno 840 GPU for a strong gaming experience, as well as LPDDR6 RAM support.</p><p>Smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 are expected to launch in October 2025. These phones include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-16-Leak-reveals-details-of-next-gen-compact-phone-with-Snapdragon-8-Elite-2.1014013.0.html">Xiaomi 16</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-15-tipped-to-launch-with-Snapdragon-8-Elite-2-ultra-slim-bezels-and-lower-display-resolution-than-OnePlus-13.1014408.0.html">OnePlus 15</a>, Realme GT8 Pro, and many others.</p><p>Lastly, the website also notes that Samsung might not use the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 since Qualcomm will allegedly make a chip specifically for the Galaxy, like it did for the Galaxy S25 series. Which means that the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26"> Galaxy S26 series</a> could show up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2600-chip-urgent-push-reported">Exynos 2600 SoC</a>, and previous rumors have indicated that this chip has been pushed into mass production.</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted rolling out a "Search History" function in Gemini, letting users rediscovery past chats with keywords and topics.</li><li>When viewing results, Gemini will show what the original query was to it, alongside a glimpse of what you've search for before clicking.</li><li>Gemini's recent updates have brought more personalization to users, like the ability for the AI save your info and ways to "tailor" its responses to you.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's Gemini app is slowly receiving a small addition to its portfolio that brings rediscovery of past encounters.</p><p>The addition, discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/19/gemini-app-chat-search/">9to5Google</a>, is reportedly tucked into Gemini's side panel (left side). If it's not already open, users can access this by clicking the hamburger menu icon at the top left corner. Now, from there, users will find a small, new magnifying glass. Gemini opens its "Search History" page with a search bar near its center.</p><p>If you know what you're looking for, or a keyword, you can input it there and Gemini will produce what it's found after a brief moment.</p><p>The number of results is stated right beneath the bar. What's more, every instance of the keyword or topic you've searched for will be highlighted in the results. The highlighted portion is simply pulled from whatever Gemini's response was to your old search, which is made apparent as it acts as the title for each result.</p><p>When clicking, users are quickly taken to that old chat with Gemini to see everything they've discussed in full.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-s-recent-history-2">Gemini's Recent History</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:924px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.94%;"><img id="kuYG9UXNCbYGTGqo7TxYjX" name="google-gemini-search-history-example" alt="A screenshot of Gemini's "Search History," which will deliver results based on your search about older chats for rediscovery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuYG9UXNCbYGTGqo7TxYjX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="924" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini would already show a variation of your chat history with it in the side panel. Under "Recent," users could see a handful of old chats, and clicking "Show More" would act as expected. However, this view is quite limited, meaning if you interact with Gemini often, you're going to miss those really old chats.</p><p>We've noticed Gemini's search function on our end, so users should begin noticing it more and more today and through the week.</p><p>Gemini's Search History introduction is wrapped in Google's previous string of more "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-free-version-now-supports-saved-info-for-personalized-responses">personalized</a>" updates for the AI model experience. Earlier this year, Google rolled out an update for Gemini Advanced that saves your information. This information encompasses whatever you've given the AI, like if you're a vegetarian, if you'd prefer responses in a different language, what your profession is, and more.</p><p>All of this is retained, so you don't have to reiterate these key points later. This is an opt-in option. If you don't want Gemini to remember things about you, it doesn't have to.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">a major update about Gemini</a> in March, which also touched on becoming more personal for users. This additional bit of personalization is powered by the 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model, bringing your other apps into the model. From there, Google says Gemini <em>can </em>leverage your behavior in Search and other areas to "tailor" its responses in a way that fits you.</p><p>Still, users remain in control and can disable this function if preferred.</p>

<ul><li>Google's NotebookLM debuts on Android, bringing AI-powered summarized information to a mobile app.</li><li>The app brings Audio Overviews and the ability for users to upload source information from anywhere on their device.</li><li>Google confirmed a standalone app was on the way earlier in May during its Gemini 2.5 Flash integration.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's AI-powered note-taking program., NotebookLM, is finally debuting on Android.</p><p>The Google NotebookLM app for Android <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.labs.language.tailwind">appeared on the Play Store</a> earlier this morning (May 19). The program specializes in condensing lengthy, chunky pieces of research into more bite-sized, manageable notes for users. With it rolling out on the Play Store, Google highlights users' ability to "create and view" notebooks on the go. NotebookLM becomes "an expert" on the topics you feed it.</p><p>Its app details state it will "summarize them" (your notes) and make "interesting connections," which are all things it does on its desktop and mobile website.</p><p>A major highlight of the NotebookLM Android app is the inclusion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a>. Instead of reading through what the AI has condensed, AI Overviews creates a radio talk show-like experience with two AI hosts that deliver the information to you. Moreover, the AI's discussion will still feature those unique connections, just in a conversational format. Details state users can "join" those discussions, likely to put forward their questions vocally.</p><p>Alternatively, if you're reading through NotebookLM's summary, users can type their questions and receive "answers with in-line citations."</p>

<p>Google drew attention to Android users' ability to quickly share files in the NotebookLM app. For example, if you've got a PDF handy that you've found, users can "share" it and find the NotebookLM logo there as an option.

This arrived via a "customize" button, letting users choose what the AI should focus on.

<p>When it comes to affordable smartphones, Motorola and Xiaomi are easily among the most popular brands out there. However, the product portfolios of these companies comprise some truly premium devices as well, with the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and the Xiaomi Mix Flip being two such products.</p><p>Both are flip-style foldables that come with just about everything you could possibly want in a top-tier smartphone, including powerhouse hardware, feature-laden software with lots of AI-based tools, and much more. While the Razr Ultra 2025 is Motorola's latest and most expensive product of its kind, the Mix Flip is Xiaomi's first offering in the clamshell foldable segment and is nearly a year old at this point. The former is also much easier to get your hands on, whereas the latter remains limited in terms of availability. So, the question is, which of these two foldables is overall a better option?</p><p>Let's take a comparative look at the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip and find out.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-xiaomi-mix-flip-design-displays-and-hardware-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip: Design, displays, and hardware</h2>
<p>Motorola has been making foldables for a while now, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> is its finest offering yet. The smartphone's back panel comes in three different finishes (vegan leather, Alcantara, and wood) and there are four colors to choose from. You also get a titanium-reinforced hinge for improved durability, as well as an IP48 certification for better ingress protection.</p><p>The cover display is a 4.0-inch LTPO pOLED panel that comes with a refresh rate of up to 165Hz and is secured with a layer of Corning's Gorilla Glass Ceramic. The inner folding display is a 7.0-inch LTPO AMOLED screen that also has a 165Hz refresh rate and can hit a peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits.</p>

<p>Xiaomi has done a fabulous job with the Mix Flip, which doesn't look and feel like a first-generation product at all. You get an aluminum frame and a dual-link hinge that can hold the device open at multiple angles for capturing photos. The smartphone is available in two colors (Black and Purple), but there's no ingress protection rating.</p><p>The 4.01-inch AMOLED cover display features a refresh rate of up to 120Hz and is protected by Xiaomi's Shield Glass. As for the inner folding screen, it's a 6.86-inch LTPO AMOLED screen that also comes with a refresh rate of 120Hz and can achieve up to 3000 nits of peak brightness.</p>

<p>Now let's talk about the internals. Being the newer product, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is powered by Qualcomm's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, working in tandem with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. Conversely, the Xiaomi Mix Flip features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC under the hood, along with 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>Although the Razr Ultra 2025 does have a slight edge over the Mix Flip due to its better innards, both devices have hardware specifications comparable to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there. Consequently, they can handle even the most resource-intensive of tasks with little to no effort.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Kgb6cQ9v3WoAUFGtAanwHi" name="xiaomi-mix-flip-40" alt="Xiaomi Mix Flip half folded against a purple background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kgb6cQ9v3WoAUFGtAanwHi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The two foldables are matched pretty evenly in terms of connectivity and I/O, with both offering features like Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, multi-band 5G support, and NFC. However, since the Xiaomi Mix Flip isn't officially available in the United States (and many other regions around the world), the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is going to have better carrier compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-xiaomi-mix-flip-software-cameras-and-battery-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip: Software, cameras, and battery</h2>
<p>The Razr Ultra 2025 runs Android 15 out of the box, with Motorola's Hello UI overlay. Even though the software experience is still fairly minimal, there are several thoughtful additions that take it to the next level, with 'Moto AI' being the most notable of them. As the name suggests, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> is the company's own suite of AI-powered tools that work alongside Google's Gemini. These include Image Studio and Playlist Studio, which can be used to generate images and create contextual music playlists.</p><p>The cover screen functionality has also gotten a bit better. You can not only use apps natively on the cover display but also set up shortcuts for in-app functions, configure widgets, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rTNrVFTitJGmdSUchw23QB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-15" alt="Look & Talk on the Razr Ultra 2025 listening for a voice" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rTNrVFTitJGmdSUchw23QB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4149" height="2334" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Running Android 14 with Xiaomi's HyperOS overlay, the Mix Flip comes with its own collection of AI-based features that are aimed at enhancing the overall user experience. Some of these tools include an AI Interpreter (for real-time translation of calls), AI Notes (for automatic formatting and summarization of notes), AI Film (for creating short cinematic videos). Of course, Google's AI features (e.g., Circle to Search) are also bundled. HyperOS comes with extensive customization options, including pet lock screens, dynamic widgets, and more.</p>
<p>While the Razr Ultra 2025 is set to receive three years of OS and four years of security updates, the Mix Flip will get four years of OS and five years of security updates. This update policy isn't really bad, but it doesn't match up to what you get with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> from companies like Samsung and Google.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vzdGhqQuamcr8SWEimpYTJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="Xiaomi Mix Flip unfolded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vzdGhqQuamcr8SWEimpYTJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to cameras, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a dual-lens primary camera system with a 50MP primary sensor and a 50MP ultrawide unit. Thanks to Motorola's collaboration with Pantone, you can expect fabulous photos with good dynamic range and vibrant colors, even in dimly lit environments.</p><p>The Xiaomi Mi Flip features a dual-lens primary camera setup as well, with a 50MP primary sensor and a 50MP telephoto module with 2x optical zoom. While the lack of an ultrawide lens is a bit of a bummer, Xiaomi's association with Leica means that the photos are packed with detail and you have a lot of fun image styles to play with.</p><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 features a 4,700mAh battery that supports 68W fast charging support. As for the Mix Flip, it has a slightly bigger 4,780mAh battery with 67W wired charging support. While these specs are almost identical, the Razr Ultra 2025 also comes with wireless charging (30W) support, whereas the Mix Flip doesn't.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-xiaomi-mix-flip-which-should-you-buy-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip: Which should you buy?</h2>
<p>There's no denying that the Razr Ultra 2025 and the Mix Flip are among the best foldable phones out there. Both these devices not only represent the best that Motorola and Xiaomi have to offer, but also prove that foldable smartphones are here to stay. They come with a similar set of features, and at the same time, have their own share of pros and cons too.</p>

<p>With a starting price of $1,299, the Razr Ultra 2025 packs top-of-the-line hardware, a laundry list of AI-based tools, an all-day battery life, and incredible cameras. It's fairly expensive, but buying one is simple and network compatibility (with both mainstream and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a>) is almost guaranteed. On the other hand, the Mix Flip can be had for a starting price as low as $899, but you'll most likely have to import it. And even if you do, you'll have to do some research to ensure whether it'll work with your wireless carrier or not. Nonetheless, it's an amazing product that comes with a great design, thoughtful software additions, and versatile cameras. So, which one should you ultimately go for?</p>
<p>Here's what we recommend! If you simply need a flagship foldable that ticks almost all the right boxes and don't mind paying a premium for it, go ahead and get the Razr Ultra 2025. However, if you're willing to go the import route and know how to check for things such as carrier compatibility, you can go for the Mix Flip and save at least $400, if not more.</p>

However, rumors point to it being improved so it could have an IP58 or IP68 rating. This would make it the only foldable to achieve this level of dust-proofing, if Samsung manages this feat.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="getting-a-higher-ip-rating-continues-to-be-a-huge-challenge-with-foldables-2">Getting a higher IP rating continues to be a huge challenge with foldables</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the Z Flip 6 were the only two foldables for a while to sport an IP48 rating. This was a big achievement for foldables and Samsung led the charge on this. An IPX8 rating which guarantees protection against only liquids, was also something Samsung pioneered. The first number in the rating denotes protection against solid particles, and the higher it goes (up to 6) the better the device is able to stay protected against much smaller solid particles or dust.</p><p>An IP48 rating ensures the device can survive ingress of solid particles larger than 1mm, which technically isn't dust. For that, we need an IP58 or IP68 rating, which is the gold standard. Going by the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/1909739032264728931">leaks and rumors</a> surrounding the Galaxy Z Fold 7, all we know is that it's expected to have "improved dust and water resistance." This technically means we should be expecting a higher IP rating, at least for the dust part of it.</p>

<p>Sealing off a foldable from water and dust is immensely challenging since there's a massive hinge to contend with, which contains multiple moving parts and intricate mechanisms. Finding a way to block dust from entering the small gaps can be very tricky. We have no doubt Samsung has been working on a way to make its foldables properly IP68-rated one day, but whether that'll happen with the Z Fold 7 remains to be seen.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is going to be yet another expensive foldable but having a higher IP rating would certainly set it apart from the rest, and maybe even convince existing Z Fold users to upgrade. We don't know for sure how secure the Fold 7 will be against dust and water, but you can be certain that it will have an IP48 rating as the bare minimum, if not better.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><u><em>Ultimate Guide</em></u></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Those eagerly awaiting Motorola's newest smartwatch rejoice, as the company delivers on its promise.</p><p>Announced earlier this morning via a press release, Motorola states consumers can expect the Watch Fit this week on May 22. Those in the U.S. will find the device available on Trekking Green for $199 on Motorola.com with "subsequent availability" on Best Buy and Amazon.</p><p>If you're in Canada, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">Moto Watch Fit</a> will be available on the same date; however, it will cost $249 CAD in Trekking Green.</p><p>The Moto Watch Fit is designed to keep active users active and ensure their sights never falter on their fitness goals. As the post reiterates, one of the watch's highlights is its 16-day battery life, meaning you won't have to stress for a while. During its launch last month, Motorola stated the Watch Fit will give users a 1.9-inch OLED protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The display should remain bright, even while out during the day in sunlight.</p><p>Feature-wise, Motorola says the Watch Fit packs support for over 100 sports modes, as well as advanced heart rate tracking, and built-in GPS.</p><p>The Watch Fit's "deep" Android integration brings media controls, photo capture, and more, meaning you can do more from your wrist.</p>

<p>April was busy for Motorola as the company not only debuted the Watch Fit but also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">the Buds Loop</a>. The Buds Loop is the brand's first open-ear buds that keep being stylish close to heart. Consumers will find a sleek design for the Buds Loop that complements its 12mm ironless drivers. This should enable the buds to deliver crisp, bold audio for music/video.</p><p>Like the Watch Fit, Motorola hopes those staying active, hitting the gym, will find comfort with the Buds Loop. In a single charge, these buds can run for up to eight hours. However, pair that with the charging case, and you can reach upwards of 37 hours.</p><p>The Buds Loop and Watch Fit debuted as accessories to Motorola's main dish: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">the Razr, Razr Plus, and Razr Ultra</a>. Instead of its expected pair of foldables, Moto stunned with three. The top-tier Razr Ultra contains a unique wood-finish with a 7-inch internal display and a 4-inch cover screen. Of course, there's tons of unique AI features users can utilize if they desire, ranging from Google's Gemini to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>.</p>

One of the latest features to be included with YouTube Premium is the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-musics-personalized-radio-stations-are-getting-even-smarter">create AI-generated radio stations</a>. Using the Ask Music feature, you can provide a simple prompt to create a custom station based on your mood, interests, genre, or even a specific event, like a themed party or gathering. Once you get started, you can continue the conversation to further refine the playlist so it’s absolutely perfect.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-ai-generated-radio-stations-on-youtube-music-2">How to create AI-generated radio stations on YouTube Music</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>YouTube Music app</strong>.</p><p>2. On the Home screen, scroll down to the <strong>Ask for music</strong> section and enter your text command in the <strong>“Ask way you like” field</strong> or <strong>tap the microphone </strong>and speak what you want. Enter a prompt like “smooth jazz for a relaxing date night” or “upbeat tunes for a cardio workout.” In this example, we chose “UK Punjabi songs.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XhesULZuxKeRnHGisaHrUK" name="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" alt="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XhesULZuxKeRnHGisaHrUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>3. The station should automatically start playing. Otherwise, you can tap the <strong>“Adjust or ask again”</strong> field or the microphone to add refinements to the radio. There are also suggestion bubbles you can choose from to get more of what you want, like, in this example, “More traditional Punjabi music,” “Similar artists from India,” or "latest Bollywood tracks."</p><p>4. Once you’re happy with the playlist, you can <strong>Shuffle play, Save to playlist, Delete radio</strong>, or <strong>Pin to Speed dial</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N6otaivVf62gJcfeTkRUTK" name="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" alt="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N6otaivVf62gJcfeTkRUTK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="how-do-ai-generated-radio-stations-work-2">How do AI-generated radio stations work?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering how this magic happens. The feature uses the power of generative AI. It can take into account the types of music and artists you traditionally love to play and help you discover new music. It can also find music based on your specific command, like tunes of a specific genre, songs or artists from a specific country, or music with a tempo that fits an overall vibe.</p><p>Your prompts will help it further refine until you get exactly what you want. Once set up, your custom playlist can last the entire duration of a summer barbecue with friends, plus the afterparty later. Everyone will wonder where you found this epic station or how long it took you to create it (Shhh, no one needs to know!).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6" name="youtube-music-hero.jpg" alt="youtube music hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Note that, as mentioned, using this feature requires a subscription to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a>, which is $14 per month. That subscription unlocks features in other apps, too, including YouTube, YouTube Kids, YouTube Gaming, and YouTube VR. There’s also the standalone YouTube Music Premium option, which is $11 per month after a one-month trial, and you can cancel at any time. It will give you access to more than 100 million songs, free from ads.</p><p>The ability to create AI-generated radio stations that use your interests or specific needs takes the guesswork out of playlist creation. This feature contributes to YouTube Music's being named among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">the best music streaming services</a>. With features like this, it’s certainly also one of the smartest.</p>

The tools allow users to pair multiple Bluetooth headphones to the same Pixel phone for content sharing, and make it possible to start or listen to a mass broadcast.</p><p>The Auracast and Bluetooth LE Audio feature is set to be a game-changer for both accessibility and content consumption. If you're interested in sharing your audio with multiple Bluetooth headphones or earbuds, you can do so now by following this guide. It'll only get easier when Android 16 officially releases, too.</p><p>If you're still catching up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me">what the terms Auracast or LE Audio even mean</a>, let's dive in, because we'll cover that as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-use-audio-sharing-on-a-pixel-phone-2">What you need to use Audio sharing on a Pixel phone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Zc27Q9iAvirgKJ4xWemU5d" name="Android-16-5" alt="The Android 16 logo on a Google Pixel 8a outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zc27Q9iAvirgKJ4xWemU5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bits of the Audio sharing feature have appeared across multiple Android beta programs, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. Currently, the Audio sharing settings page isn't visible in Android 16 Beta 4, but it can be enabled in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/all-about-your-phones-developer-options">Developer Options</a> on supported Pixel phones. You will need a Google Pixel 8 series or newer phone to access this feature, as it requires Auracast.</p><p>It appears that running the Android 16 beta is actually optional to activate Audio sharing, as the Developer Options toggle you need to find is available on Android 15 devices. If you are interested in becoming a tester, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">follow this guide to install the Android 16 beta on your Pixel phone</a>.</p><p>After that, you can follow these steps to make it appear:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Scroll down and tap <strong>About phone</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap your <strong>build number</strong> multiple times in succession to enable Developer Options.</p><p>4. You'll see <strong>You are now a developer</strong> when you have done this successfully.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SSkJjHFK5eBZTdsjoum2uF" name="Enable-Developer-Options-Pixel" alt="Enabling Developer Options on a Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSkJjHFK5eBZTdsjoum2uF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, you've successfully activated Developer Options and can find the hidden toggle needed to reveal Audio sharing. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>System page</strong>, then press the <strong>Developer Options tab</strong>.</p><p>3. Find <strong>Enable Bluetooth LE Audio Broadcast UI preview</strong> in the list, and flip the toggle <strong>on</strong>.</p><p>4. Follow the on-screen prompts to <strong>restart your phone</strong> so that the changes take effect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="duRnQ87Y4W6VDnF5y5vKcm" name="Enable-Audio-Sharing-Dev-Op" alt="Enabling visibility for the Audio Sharing page in Android 16." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/duRnQ87Y4W6VDnF5y5vKcm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, you'll be able to find the <strong>Audio sharing </strong>page in your <strong>Settings app</strong> on a supported Google Pixel phone. This is a fair bit of work to gain access to a feature, but that's because Audio sharing is still not publicly available yet.</p><p>All the steps in this section won't be required when Google officially rolls out Bluetooth LE and Auracast support via Audio sharing in a public release, but it's unclear when that will be. Since the feature isn't visible by default in the latest Android 16 Beta 4.1 release, it's not guaranteed that Audio sharing will be available on day one.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-start-audio-sharing-2">How to start Audio sharing</h2>
<p>Audio sharing requires supported earbuds or headphones, as you won't be able to start it on a Pixel phone without at least one pair connected. Your audio devices need to support Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio to work with Audio sharing, and we have a rundown of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">some supported earbuds and headphones here</a>. Not all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best Android earbuds</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">headphones</a> support this feature, but many — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-vs-airpods-pro-2">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">3 Pro</a> — offer Bluetooth LE Audio.</p><p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em><em> If you don't immediately see your supported headphones or earbuds show up as Audio sharing compatible, completely forgetting the device and re-pairing should do the trick. Check if there's a toggle for </em><em><strong>LE Audio</strong></em><em> in the device settings page for each set of compatible earbuds, too.</em></p><p>With all that in mind, when you have Audio sharing visible on a Pixel phone and supported earbuds ready, you can start sharing by following these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Connected devices page</strong>, then press <strong>Connection preferences</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Audio sharing page</strong>, which is now visible.</p><p>4. Flip the toggle beside <strong>Audio sharing </strong>to start.</p><p>5. You'll now see a <strong>QR code</strong> appear for your broadcast alongside your device name and optional broadcast password — both of which are needed for others to connect to your broadcast.</p><p>6. Tap <strong>Pair new device</strong> to add earbuds or headphones or <strong>Close </strong>to finish.</p><p>7. You can also join an existing broadcast by tapping <strong>Find an audio stream</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yvovrzykWZkmhXQ2uCUCqY" name="Android-16-Share-Audio" alt="Starting an audio share on Android 16 with a Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvovrzykWZkmhXQ2uCUCqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After that, you've created a broadcast and have the option to pair multiple LE Audio-compatible headsets to your Pixel phone. With full Auracast support, this is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">crucial for accessibility reasons</a> — public events, sporting contests and concerts, and transit hubs can send out Auracast-compatible broadcasts that anyone can listen to. It's also a handy tool in general, as you can share music or a movie with the person next to you or the entire room.</p>
<h2 id="when-will-audio-sharing-publicly-debut-2">When will Audio sharing publicly debut?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nmHuh73Ph6jfqH87JCEXck" name="Android-16-3" alt="The Android 16 logo on a Google Pixel 8a outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmHuh73Ph6jfqH87JCEXck.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Audio sharing, with Bluetooth LE and Auracast, is confirmed to be heading to Pixel phones soon with the release of Android 16. Google touted the feature as part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Android 16 Beta 3's release notes</a>, the same update that reached platform stability for the first time. At the moment, we don't know exactly <em>when</em> in Android 16's lifecycle the feature will release — it could be available on day one or arrive in a future Android 16 update.</p><p>The good news is that you don't have to wait because Pixel phone users running both Android 15 and the Android 16 beta can use Audio sharing today. Whether you need hearing assistance or simply want to share your phone's audio with a friend, this handy Android 16 feature can help.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I have a half-dozen Govee products, including wall lights, TV backlights, gaming-focused lights, and curtain lights, and the brand consistently does a great job delivering useful features and rock-solid connectivity. Govee's latest product is the Gaming Pixel Light, and it is basically a pixel light grid that's highly customizable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GYgeyaFFBUVMPxJEyLeGFL" name="Govee Gaming Pixel Light" alt="Govee Gaming Pixel Light review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYgeyaFFBUVMPxJEyLeGFL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Gaming Pixel Light is available in two sizes — a 32x32 grid that measures 5.3 x 5.3 inches, and a 52x32 grid that comes in at 8.5 x 5.3 inches — and Govee sent both models over. I prefer the 52x32 as it has a bigger canvas. Interestingly, both models get a 3W audio driver, and you can get alerts via the device itself. There's  a stand included in the package that lets you put the Gaming Pixel Light on your desk, and it is wall-mountable.</p>

<p>Govee showcased the product in January, and it went on sale starting May 19. The 32x32 variant of the Gaming Pixel Light (H6630) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Gaming-Real-time-Display-Options/dp/B0DZ6T9VCM">is on Amazon at $119</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Gaming-Real-time-Display-Options/dp/B0DZ6QJ5ZC">52x32 model (H6631) costs $139</a>. Both models are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.govee.com/products/govee-gaming-pixel-light?variant=44661771960505">available on Govee's website</a> as well, and they cost the same as Amazon.</p>

<p>The idea behind the Gaming Pixel Light is that you can put it up on your desk and have it scroll through various scenes; it serves as an analog or digital clock, shows real-time weather (you'll need to enter the city name), and there's a nifty countdown timer as well. And if you're invested in all things blockchain, you even get the ability to view real-time Bitcoin pricing (it refreshes every five minutes).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rEqoqgVGhUbK3TsZBLPycL" name="Govee Gaming Pixel Light" alt="Govee Gaming Pixel Light review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rEqoqgVGhUbK3TsZBLPycL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the ability to use it as an analog clock, but as it doesn't show the seconds hand, I switched to weather mode instead, and it was quite nifty. What's particularly great is that you can use the pixel grid to show various scenes; there are over 150 scenes programmed in the Govee app, and you get a vast selection of choices. The best part about using Govee products is that they can be integrated into Home Assistant, and it is a big reason why I prefer using the brand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2roocSkEP6GR42kLUYN4gL" name="Govee Gaming Pixel Light" alt="Govee Gaming Pixel Light review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2roocSkEP6GR42kLUYN4gL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pixelated grid is decidedly retro, but the LED colors are uniform, and you can adjust the brightness of the panel. There's a music mode as well that changes the patterns dynamically based on music playing in the vicinity (it has a built-in mic), and my favorite feature is the ability to use your own images or videos on the panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Uja5WGHebJ9cPdkUZiuEeL" name="Govee Gaming Pixel Light" alt="Govee Gaming Pixel Light review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uja5WGHebJ9cPdkUZiuEeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like everything else these days, you get an AI-assisted feature that lets you create new scenes by talking to the Govee AI assistant. I asked it to create a Pac-Man scene, and it did a semi-decent job. To round out the features, you get a finger drawing mode that lets you sketch out a pattern to use on the panel.</p>

<p>The design itself ties in with a gamer-focused aesthetic, with the black design intersected by jagged edges and green etched lines. The speaker is housed at the back, and you have controls up top to switch the panel on or off, adjust volume, and change scenes.</p>

<p>The only limitation with the Gaming Pixel Light is that it needs to be plugged in — there's no built-in battery. That obviously curbs its usability as you'll need to house it in a location with easy access to a wall plug, and I would've liked a truly portable unit with a battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zLW4vzkJwbPgr6PJHKLjXL" name="Govee Gaming Pixel Light" alt="Govee Gaming Pixel Light review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zLW4vzkJwbPgr6PJHKLjXL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that, the Gaming Pixel Light is faultless. If you grew up playing 8-bit games and want a pixel grid that's highly customizable, this is the one to get. Govee did a fantastic job with the panel, but it's the customizability where the Gaming Pixel Light truly shines. If you're eyeing this product, I'd suggest getting the 52x32 model.</p>

<p>Xiaomi is all set to announce its new in-house-developed silicon chipset dubbed XRing 01. New information and a couple of leaked benchmark tests reveal what the upcoming chipset will have to offer.</p><p>The XRing 01 is believed to be exclusive to the China region for now, and it will be unveiled on May 22 through a product launch event. The teased posters on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/u/2202387347">Weibo</a> also indicate that it is an advanced 3nm-based silicon (2nd gen), and leaked benchmarks indicate that it is likely a strong contender to Qualcomm’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> that powers most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagship phones</a> this year.</p>

On the other hand, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1924310555445416426/photo/1">tipster Ice Universe</a> has also shared another Geekbench test of the same chipset that revealed even better 3017 single-core and 9264 multi-core readings, which sounds promising for a new unreleased SoC.</p><p>The benchmark also implies that the XRing 01 is being run on an Android 15-based phone, likely the Xiaomi 15S Pro, which is also believed to be announced at the same event alongside the Xiaomi Pad 7 Ultra.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xiaomi XRing O1 pic.twitter.com/KUZ4zeJQaA<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1924244770563785102">May 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, the Geekbench test also reveals the unique deca-core setup featuring two cores with 1.80GHz clock speeds, another two with 1.89GHz, four 3.40GHz speed cores, and two other cores with 3.90GHz.</p><p>The latter are expected to be the two Cortex-X925 cores, and the four are believed to be Cortex A725/X4 cores. The cores with 1.89GHz are likely the Cortex A720/A725 ones, and the first two are expected to be the Cortex A520 cores.</p><p>With the expected configuration and benchmark tests, the chipset alongside the Snapdragon 8 Elite is likely to take on Dimensity 9400 and Exynos 2400 SoCs as well. The chipset ahead of the release already sounds promising, which is understandable since the company has invested four years in research and development in making the SoC. It also makes Xiaomi join the list with its counterparts like Huawei, Apple, and Google, who all already develop their in-house chipsets for their flagships.</p>

<hr>
<p>2025 is turning out to be an interesting year for smartphones as we are getting to see more diverse models than the conventional flagships. While we recently got to see a slim phone from Samsung, OnePlus is set to debut its compact phone.</p><p>Dubbed OnePlus 13s, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact handset</a> is making its way to the Indian market on June 5, and the teasers indicate that it is coming in at least three colors: black, pink, and a military green hue. The device also makes a notable departure from the conventional circular camera visor and instead opts for a squarish design that features two sensors.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A new icon debuts. Save the date. #OnePlus13s pic.twitter.com/Hdgx6Afhf4<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1924352478390403208">May 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Needless to say, the upcoming OnePlus 13s is pretty similar to what the company has announced in China last month, which is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">OnePlus 13T</a>. Like the latter, the OnePlus 13s is also confirmed to have a 6.32-inch display and is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/launch/13s">OnePlus website listing</a>.</p><p>The other confirmed features of the OnePlus 13s include an all-new Plus Key, which replaces the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-to-ditch-alert-slider-in-favor-of-new-button">famous Alert Slider</a>. While the slider offered minimal functionality, like changing the sound profiles, the Plus Key promises to offer several other functionalities, like setting it for sound profiles, enabling Do Not Disturb mode, invoking the camera, flashlight, to translate what’s on screen, and several others, which can also be AI-powered.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WsXqpghfmNZgJws7MdHM7e" name="OnePlus-13s-teaser-image" alt="OnePlus 13s tease for India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WsXqpghfmNZgJws7MdHM7e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13s will also be 5.5G ready and also have an independent G1 Wi-Fi chipset and further promises to offer the best battery life on a compact phone. The OnePlus 13T in China notably featured a larger 6260mAh battery, a tad bit higher than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and 13R, which had 6000mAh batteries each. And, the latter two are significantly bigger in size than the OnePlus 13T’s compact offering. So, we expect a similar approach on the OnePlus 13s as well, including the incorporation of the company’s Glacier battery technology.</p><p>It is finally good to see the OnePlus 13s finally having a launch date after a host of teasers from the company that were shared on social media, and also on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/b?_encoding=UTF8&ie=UTF8&node=206845240031&store_ref=SB_A0221685GDPRJL3VQSBS-A06744412OMDOB09ESPP0&pd_rd_plhdr=t&aaxitk=ab41b09131f3ab6de73dfc7db206c1e3&hsa_cr_id=0&lp_query=oneplus+13s&lp_slot=auto-sparkle-hsa-tetris&pd_rd_w=ePE30&content-id=amzn1.sym.5e94cbee-68a7-46b5-b2e9-bb5445edd00f:amzn1.sym.5e94cbee-68a7-46b5-b2e9-bb5445edd00f&pf_rd_p=5e94cbee-68a7-46b5-b2e9-bb5445edd00f&pf_rd_r=AM3FJ89TXFNSSS4PXNXB&pd_rd_wg=8SFde&pd_rd_r=be384195-b096-4101-b91e-706a6f498047&linkCode=sl2&tag=prsocial-21&linkId=fd1f401f3512d91f0cdec15cd78b3fca&language=en_IN&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Amazon India listing</a>. Starting with the Indian market, the compact phone from the company is hopefully expected to make its way to other regions in the near future.</p>

<p>A lot is going on inside the M18i. Internally, the DAC uses dual ESS ES9219Q DACs and other hardware powered by a 16-core XMOS XU316 processor. You also get a Qualcomm chipset that includes its latest clear voice communications chipset and Infineon MEMS microphones. We’ll talk about those components more in a moment. There are a few other things inside the DAC, but I’ll go over those as I talk about audio quality. Check the spec table for other odds and technical ends you may be curious about.</p><p>The build quality is very reassuring. The unit is small, and all components are wrapped in a CNC anodized aluminum alloy. There’s a tempered glass screen on the front of the device with an OLED display. The information you’ll get from the top row of that screen is: volume, gain level (<strong>L</strong>ow or <strong>H</strong>igh), earbuds/headphone connected indicator, and battery charge indicator. Below that, you’ll see your sample rate in a larger font, and below that, the mode and decoding indicators.</p>

<p>Holding the device vertically with the screen facing you, the top is where you’ll find the 3.5mm (SE) and 4.4mm (Balanced) outputs. The right side is where you’ll find the delightfully clicky function buttons. You get a power button that will also dim the screen, separate volume up and down buttons, an MFB or multifunction button that controls gain and Bluetooth functions, and a mode sliding switch that is stiff and doesn’t feel like it will get loose anytime soon.</p><p>You’ll find one of two USB-C ports at the bottom of the unit. This one is primarily for data transfer, but in PC mode, the unit does charge from the source it’s connected to. The second USB-C port is on the left side and doesn’t support data. Charging only.</p>

<p>Overall, the M18i is one of the more transparent, nuanced mobile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android" target="_blank">DACs I’ve had the pleasure of testing</a>. Let’s talk about using it to drive the equally transparent, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie900-review" target="_blank">analytical Sennheiser IE900s</a>: This pairing is <em>not</em> for bass lovers, though tracks mastered with a heavy-handed low end sound superb with regard to their low-end nuance and resolve. Using the IE900s with the gain set to low and the 4.4mm Balanced connection, I could drive them beautifully with the volume only halfway up at 30 of 60 steps.</p><p>What is the “flavor profile” of this pairing? Very transparent. No color. An enjoyably large soundstage for IEMs, but the most compelling sonic feature is the nuance. Playing the DSF file of Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Starting Somethin’,” there are backing vocals mixed to almost a whisper, you can clearly discern during the song’s intro at 15 seconds in. A feature of that mix that gets lost in less transparent sound reproduction with more colored DACs and earbuds/headphones.</p><p>Regarding tracks mastered with bass emphasis, The Roots’ “Do You Want More??!!!?” sounds exactly like it should, with no coloring of the boom bap heavy bass. The bass is still quite satisfying with this pairing. A PCM file of Marvin Gaye’s “Trouble Man” exposes an awesome orchestral arrangement! All the nuance, layered electric and analog pianos, saxophones, and cymbals. It’s an engrossing sonic experience with the M18i. In terms of signal-to-noise, the M18i is very dark!</p><p>There is no audible noise during the quiet parts of the intro to Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KzRN8jwKpueHSZ9gkmB5kk" name="questyle-m18i-dac-sample-rate.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i showing PCM file sample rate and Low gain in use" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KzRN8jwKpueHSZ9gkmB5kk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My sound test, pairing the M18i with Campfire Audio’s Mammoth IEMs via the 3.5mm connection, brought more weight and drama to the music with its more entertaining, punchier sound reproduction in the low end and sub-bass. There was some nuance lost in the low end with the IE900 that was realized with the Mammoth IEMs. This is the bass lovers' pairing.</p><p>Sennheiser HD660S2 was the first pairing that benefited from the high gain option, even with more juice flowing through the 4.4mm cables. I had to increase volume by nine steps, to 39. Over-ears allow the M18i to “stretch its legs” and expand that soundstage, giving it greater depth and layers as I listened to “Violin Duel” from the Chevalier OST.</p><p>The detail in the attack and decay of the violins in Violin Duel was top tier! Next up, Ladysmith Black Mombazo’s ethereal a cappella on Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” was equally enjoyable, being so immersive thanks to the rich timbre and clarity provided in part by Questyle’s patented current-mode amplifier SiP technology found in all of their DACs.</p><p>In Bluetooth mode, the sound quality is still delightful. That said, there is a difference between the wired and Bluetooth 5.4 presentations. Still, thanks to the broad support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained" target="_blank">Qualcomm aptX and LDAC HiRes Wireless Audio codecs</a>, that difference is minimal and likely indistinguishable to those new to active listening.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Q6NcKS7gUMsr2aGiLC9dfj" name="questyle-m18i-dac-microphone.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i showing power and volume buttons, along with the microphone port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q6NcKS7gUMsr2aGiLC9dfj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Continuing with the Bluetooth implementation, the Qualcomm chipset gave me better mic audio than expected. Frankly, this Infineon MEMS mic setup in the M18i sounds better than many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">Bluetooth earbuds</a> I've reviewed, up there with Jabra, Beats, and AirPods Pro. It doesn't 100% eliminate background noise, but it gives you a healthy balance of background noise dampening with crystal clear voice pickup, so you don't sound like you're in a closet, as some TWS earbuds do.</p><p>Overall, from mobile to PC, the M18i presents an impressive sonic image. It’s balanced and transparent, with beautifully layered instrumentation separation. It also has the versatility to go anywhere and connect to almost anything, including Linux and HarmonyOS.</p>
<h2 id="the-m18i-is-almost-perfect-except-for-2">The M18i is almost perfect, except for….</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Pn4jkfVxLpcnTohUA8jVEj" name="questyle-m18i-dac-charging-port.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i showing the dedicated USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pn4jkfVxLpcnTohUA8jVEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life will be a pain point. One hour of wired hi-res file playback drained the battery from 97% to 41%. My results in battery testing were pretty consistent across modes, except for PC mode. That means the max you can expect out of the M18i is roughly two hours of playback.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a feature that mitigates the disappointing battery life of the internal 500mAh cell. Switching to PC mode will power the DAC from whatever device it’s plugged into. I tested that with my Google Pixel 9, and the phone’s battery drained at a rate of approximately 10% per hour. I tested with the phone in airplane mode because I wanted to see what the pull looked like without additional factors draining the battery, like weak cellular signal strength.</p><p>The side USB-C port also helps mitigate the short battery life. It supports charging <em>during</em> playback, so you can have a battery bank with you on that long-haul airplane ride to keep the tunes going as you cross the Atlantic or Pacific.</p>

<p>I’ve had the pleasure of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android" target="_blank">testing some wonderfully entertaining audiophile-grade mobile DACs</a> from iFi, Quedelix, and Fiio, and this is now one of my favorites. The sound quality is one of the best on the market, with the utility to ensure you get the most bang for your hard-earned buck.</p><p>Its MSRP is $400, but it’s currently on sale direct from Questyle’s website for $350. At the time of writing, it's also on Amazon with a $50 coupon, bringing the price down to $300. If you already have a good pair of IEMs or wired headphones, consider the M18i as you read reviews of competing products.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-samsung-being-so-stingy-with-charging-speeds-on-the-fold-7-2">Why is Samsung being so stingy with charging speeds on the Fold 7?</h2>
<p>Samsung's 2025 A series phones are looking more exciting by the day than its upcoming foldable, which does not bode well for a phone that'll cost north of $1,500. We've gotten quite a few details about Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, and it's expected to be the company's slimmest foldable yet.</p><p>A leak from prolific tipster Ice Universe claims that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will use the same 4,400mAh battery capacity as the Z Fold 6. This is not terrible news when you consider the phone is expected to be a lot thinner, so keeping the same capacity while being thinner is commendable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW" name="multi-window-galaxy-z-fold-6.jpg" alt="Multi-window apps on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sadly, what's also going to be the same is the charging speed. In early February, it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-to-carry-z-fold-edition-features">tipped</a> that the Z Fold 7 would be nothing more than an upscaled Z Fold 6 Special Edition, and this recent filing on China's 3C regulatory website, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-charging-speed-3536509/">reported</a> by Android Authority, almost confirms this rumor about the charging speed being unchanged at 25W.</p><p>It is a real shame that a $1,500+ smartphone would have just 25W fast charging when Samsung's own $300 A series phone gets 45W charging. While not everyone is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-are-we-obsessed-with-charging-speeds">obsessed with having the fastest charging</a>, it doesn't hurt to be able to charge your phone quicker if you can.</p><p>Samsung has been very stubborn with charging speeds, even for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best flagship</a> S series phones, reserving the faster 45W charging only for batteries larger than 4,500mAh. And since the Galaxy Z Fold 7 won't be getting a larger battery capacity, it's most likely stuck with the measly 25W charging.</p><p>While this is still speculation at this point since the Galaxy Z Fold 7 isn't officially out yet, all the credible rumors point to the fact that it will most likely have 25W fast charging, and not the 45W we were all hoping for.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Much like phones, smartwatches became sophisticated over the past decade, limiting the need for annual updates. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 wasn't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-galaxy-watch-6">that much different from the Galaxy Watch 6</a>, for instance. If you needed any evidence of that, Samsung's two-year release cadence for Classic and Ultra models is a good indicator. But with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8</a> on the horizon, is it finally time for Galaxy Watch 6 owners to consider an upgrade?</p><p>The answer might just be yes. While the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 likely won't be official for another few months, there's reason to believe it'll offer features that build on Watch 7 improvements. We have leaks and rumors predicting a design change, new health sensors, and other fitness features.</p><p>Want an early look at how the Galaxy Watch 8 might compare to the Galaxy Watch 6? Here's the speculative breakdown.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-6-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 6: Pricing and availability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="epMw6fX5kQaJBUuk4svWca" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-and-6-Classic-on-desk.jpeg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic and Galaxy Watch 6 side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/epMw6fX5kQaJBUuk4svWca.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic and Galaxy Watch 6 side-by-side/ </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> launch date is far from official, but leakers have tipped that the company will host a Galaxy Unpacked event in New York City sometime in mid-July. That tracks with past Galaxy Watch launches, as the last two generations launched on July 10 and July 26 in 2024 and 2023, respectively. That means the launch is only months away, and leaks should intensify as that date gets closer.</p><p>The big uncertainty is whether Samsung will raise prices this year, as the ongoing U.S. tariff situation ensures price hikes are always a possibility. However, we haven't seen any leaks regarding price increases for the Galaxy Watch 8 series yet. If pricing remains the same, the 40mm Galaxy Watch 8 could start at $299, and the 44mm Galaxy Watch 8 could start at $329.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 launched at those exact same prices roughly two years ago, but has since come down in price. You can pick up a Galaxy Watch 6 for around $150 to $180 in new condition at major retailers like Best Buy and Amazon. Color options include Graphite, Silver (44mm only), and Gold (40mm only).</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-6-design-and-hardware-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 6: Design and hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Rj2HbGVfYtuV8N6etzrJSH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-6-3.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rj2HbGVfYtuV8N6etzrJSH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) stacked. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is already making bold claims about the Galaxy Watch 8's design, even before it is publicly announced. The company's corporate VP of MX Division, Daniel Araujo, previewed the upcoming smartwatch by saying it'll feature an "innovative design" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-q1-device-earnings-soar-its-chip-sales-take-a-hit" target="_blank">in a Q1 2025 earnings call</a>.</p><p>Specifically, Araujo said Samsung plans to "launch a new Galaxy Watch with an innovative design and enhanced health-related features." It's all part of an effort to grow Galaxy wearables "with a strengthened premium experience while expanding our lineup across all price segments."</p><p>It's unclear what exactly Samsung is referring to by an "innovative design," because there are only so many ways to design a smartwatch. Likely, the Galaxy Watch 8 will take a few design cues from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. There have been reported internal talks at Samsung about a squircle smartwatch design, and a squircle chassis with a circular display — like the Ultra — could be a way for the company to achieve this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.99%;"><img id="rA8x92xSnWTA8k4dJkeC4V" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leaked-graphics" alt="A set of leaked graphics of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 and 8 Classic with a "squircle" design and a "Quick" button on the latter." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rA8x92xSnWTA8k4dJkeC4V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="962" height="327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A set of leaked graphics of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 and 8 Classic with a "squircle" design and a "Quick" button on the latter. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This seems to be the path Samsung plans to take with the Galaxy Watch 8, as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-series-imagery-squircle-quick-button-leaks">set of leaked images</a> reveal a similar look in device mockups. It's also another indicator that the company indeed plans to launch a Watch 8 Classic variant for the first time in a generation. Otherwise, current rumors indicate Samsung will retain the same general form factor, with 40mm and 44mm variants, for the Watch 8.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ng7EwTzTP7RFHNdYehnDVE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-watchface-detailed.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ng7EwTzTP7RFHNdYehnDVE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does that compare to the current Galaxy Watch 6? If the rumored design changes actually happen, the Watch 6 will have a completely different look due to its circular chassis. This could be a pro or a con, depending on your style preferences. The screen sizes will likely be the same between models, even if the Watch 8 has a larger case size as a result of its squircle housing.</p><p>If Samsung doesn't change the display itself on the Galaxy Watch 8, both models will sport the same Super AMOLED panels with matching resolutions. The Galaxy Watch 7 was offered in 1.3-inch, 432x432, and 1.5-inch, 480x480 display options, just like the Watch 6 that came before it. Both watches are also expected to offer IP68 water and dust-resistance certifications while meeting military durability standards.</p>

<p>The big difference between the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Galaxy Watch 6, in terms of hardware, will be their health sensors. The former will likely include Samsung's latest optical bio-signal sensor, while the latter has a last-generation BioActive sensor. Samsung introduced a newer sensor with the Galaxy Watch 7, but could tap further into it with new features on the Watch 8.</p><p>One thing that isn't likely to change much is the battery life. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has a 40-hour battery life estimate, and the Galaxy Watch 8 should come with the exact same promise. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/new-leak-hints-at-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8s-existence" target="_blank">This is according to a leak</a> that revealed the Galaxy Watch 8's battery specs in regulatory filings.</p>

<p>Per the documents above, the bigger Galaxy Watch 8 will get a 10mAh size increase, raising the total capacity to 435mAh. However, the 40mm model won't get any additional capacity, which strongly suggests there will be no battery life improvements for the Galaxy Watch 8 this year.</p>

<p>Samsung is widely expected to launch the Galaxy Watch 8 with Wear OS 6, which has already been teased ahead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-io-2025">Google I/O 2025</a> and shown off during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">The Android Show</a> (at least the stock Pixel version). Meanwhile, the Galaxy Watch 6 launched with Wear OS 4 but has since received the upgrade to Wear OS 5. Among the improvements in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">10% battery life increase for some models</a>.</p><p>Keep in mind that the Galaxy Watch 6 still has roughly two years of software support left, so it should eventually get the boost to Wear OS 6.</p><p>Separately, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-gemini-galaxy-watch-buds-integration-announcement">confirmed</a> that Galaxy Watch models will get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> support, replacing Google Assistant. This change will hit Galaxy Watch hardware "in the coming months," potentially lining up with the Galaxy Unpacked event where the Galaxy Watch 8 should debut.</p>

<p>Gemini on Galaxy Watch will offer "hands-free assistance using natural voice commands," per the company. It can help with reminders, summaries, and notifications. If prior Samsung launches are any indication, Samsung could launch the Galaxy Watch 8 with extra Gemini and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, with basic functionality trickling down to devices like the Galaxy Watch 6.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 could be a worthy upgrade over the Galaxy Watch 6, but only for the right kind of person. If you use your Galaxy Watch for basic smartwatch features — like media controls, messaging, and notifications — there's no reason to toss aside your Galaxy Watch 6. It's running the latest One UI 6 Watch version and will get the boost to Wear OS 6 eventually. In other words, there's a lot of life left in it.</p><p>If you're the kind of smartwatch user who craves accurate and advanced health and fitness metrics, the Galaxy Watch 8 becomes a much more enticing option. Samsung introduced a new BioActive sensor with last year's Watch 7 that addresses many of the accuracy problems we had with the Watch 6, and those improvements will likely compound with the Watch 8. If we're lucky, we may even get brand new Watch 8 health capabilities.</p><p>Either way, we won't know for sure whether the Galaxy Watch 8 is a clear victor over the Galaxy Watch 6 until the former is officially announced. The good news is that we won't have to wait much longer.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Oriveti is a Hong Kong-based audio manufacturer that's doing all the right things in the budget audio segment. I just looked at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/orivetis-blackbird-are-entry-level-iems-that-soar-high">entry-level Blackbird IEMs</a>, and the brand somehow managed to create a set with plenty of bass and a vibrant sound — something that usually isn't the case with entry-level products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QugSs2zZeeCf6Z2KtPSMdY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QugSs2zZeeCf6Z2KtPSMdY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sitting in the tier above is the OD200; I've had these IEMs for over four months now, and they've held up well. The OD200 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oriveti.com/product-page/oriveti-od200-single-dynamic-driver-hifi-iem">available on the brand's website for $199</a>, and over in India (where I got my unit), the brand teamed up with local retailer Headphone Zone and is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.headphonezone.in/products/headphone-zone-x-oriveti-od200">selling the product at ₹9,999</a> ($118). After launching last year, it has consistently been among the best-selling budget IEMs on the site, and that alone is indicative of its potential.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="STVNHoa6b8RBizWEujyvkY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/STVNHoa6b8RBizWEujyvkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, let's start with the design. The OD200 has possibly the best build quality of any budget IEMs; it has an all-metal chassis with an anodized finish, and the contoured design ensures you get a great fit. I thought the IEMs would be on the heavier side, but that isn't the case — I didn't see any issues with comfort even with extended use.</p>

<p>What I like is that you can significantly alter the sound by switching out the nozzles — there are two available in the package. Another interesting addition is the unique airflow, with Oriveti using a custom system that ensures better airflow to the acoustic chamber, leading to much better sound quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jiFQgRNjThbiqQE9ZX3hiY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jiFQgRNjThbiqQE9ZX3hiY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll also note that Oriveti is particularly generous with the accessories it bundled with the OD200; you get a massive package that includes 13 sets of ear tips — much more than what's normally provided in this category — and a high-quality cable and hard-shell carrying case.</p>
<p>Continuing with the positives, the OD200 comes with an interchangeable cable, with 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 4.4mm plugs bundled as standard. Again, this is something that you just don't see in the budget segment, and the attention to detail that Oriveti lavished on the design and accessories is unmatched.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="827iFokj352WjKGsVbmgjY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/827iFokj352WjKGsVbmgjY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the OD200 predominantly with the silver nozzle, and it produces a distinctive sound that's highly engaging. I paired the monitors with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m15s-review">Fiio's M15S player</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19</a>, and I recommend using a DAC that has decent power.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TGmZywEWvg9iPVXKyNdSiY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TGmZywEWvg9iPVXKyNdSiY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like the Blackbird, the OD200 shines with the low-end, delivering a wonderfully rich and detailed bass with vigor. The bass is very engaging, and it's easy to see why these IEMs sell so well — they're ideally suited to listen to modern music. The mid-range is clean, and you get good instrument separation along with vocal clarity. If anything, I think the mid-range detail is where the OD200 comes into its own; it is wonderful in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gK3CseWaJeEe5odjkj4gkY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gK3CseWaJeEe5odjkj4gkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's good treble extension as well, but it isn't fatiguing in the least, and you don't notice any sibilance. Overall, there really isn't anything to criticize with the OD200; the IEMs have a robust design that's built to last, and they include an extensive range of accessories. But where they stand out is the sound quality — these may just be one of the best-sounding IEMs I've used, and they're now my go-to recommendation in this category.</p>

The new additions include an IP48 rating, a sturdier hinge, and Pantone-validated cameras for better color accuracy.</p></p>

While it made a good alternative to the Samsung Z Flip 4 at $999, you can now find the phone for about $499 online, making it a great bargain for a flagship flip phone. You'll still have to live a few compromises though, most of which are addressed by the 2025 model.</p></p>

<p>Motorola really hit the ground running when it reimagined the Razr line in 2023 with the standard phone and the Plus model. The Razr Plus 2023 is still being sold online for nearly half of the $999 price tag it launched for back in 2023. This certainly makes it tempting for anyone wanting a brand-new flip smartphone but is put off by the outlandish prices.</p><p>We really enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus 2023</a> when we reviewed it, despite its many shortcomings. But Motorola has iterated fast and hard since then, making the 2024 model even better, while the new 2025 Razr Plus adds more refinements to an already great phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr Plus 2025</a> is not longer the hero product, that spot has been taking up by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>. The Razr Plus 2025 still costs $999 and features some big improvements over the 2023 model. It also costs twice as much though. If you're looking at a Motorola Razr Plus 2025 vs. Razr Plus 2023 comparison, should you spring for the latest one or save a lot and pick the older model?</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4162px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKqyUEQvAG4dBBd6W6EPeG" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Razr-Plus-2023-2.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 next to the Razr Plus 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKqyUEQvAG4dBBd6W6EPeG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4162" height="2341" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 2025 Razr Plus and the 2023 model look quite similar at first glance. Both have roughly the same thickness of about 7mm when unfolded and around 15.1mm when closed. The new model is actually a bit heavier at 189 grams, compared to 184 grams of the 2023 model. The older Razr has broader metal strips on the back where the two halves meet when unfolded, compared to much slimmer ones on the 2025 model.</p><p>A quick way to differentiate the two is by the colors. The 2023 Razr Plus comes in Infinite Black, Glacier Blue, Viva Magenta, Peach Fuzz, while the 2025 model comes in Pantone colors of Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink.</p><p>What's not immediately visible is the ingress protection. The 2023 Razr Plus only had a splash-resistant coating but the 2025 Razr Plus has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">proper IP48 rating for dust and water resistance</a>. This puts it on par with the more expensive Galaxy Z Flip 6 (and in all likelihood, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Z Flip 7</a> too). This is a big upgrade that Motorola has given to the new Razr and one many buyers will be paying attention to.</p>

<p>The other big change in the 2025 Razr Plus is to the outer display. It features a 4-inch LTPO AMOLED panel with a 165Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 2,400 nits. The 2023 Razr Plus had a 3.6-inch display with a slightly lower resolution, a 144Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1,100 nits. The outer displays of both models are still way ahead of what Samsung offers.</p><p>The size of the main folding display of both phones has stayed the same at 6.9 inches. The resolutions and refresh rates are the same, too, but the brightness in the 2025 Razr Plus is 3,000 nits, compared to 1,400 nits in the 2023 model. This spec alone should make using the folding screen under direct sunlight infinitely better, as we had some trouble clearly viewing the Razr Plus 2023's display in sunlight.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 might not be that different from the 2024 model, but it has some big upgrades compared to the 2023 model. Firstly, it ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, so you're already on the latest software version when you buy it. I would have liked a longer update commitment from Motorola by now, but it's still three years of OS upgrades only.</p><p>The next notable change is the core hardware. The 2025 Moto Razr Plus features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a> SoC from the 2024 model, which is a mildly cut-down version of the 8 Gen 3. You do get 12GB of RAM, versus 8GB on the 2023 model.</p><p>Cameras are a big upgrade on the 2025 model, with a 50MP main and 50MP telephoto, although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">we would have preferred an ultrawide here</a>. The resolution jump should produce much sharper images and better low-light photos, as this is one area where the 2023 Razr Plus fell short.</p><p>Finally, the battery is a lot bigger and charging is faster too, both wired and wireless. We weren't impressed with the 2023 Razr Plus' battery life, so this 2025 model should provide a good boost.</p>

<p>Motorola has already rolled out the Android 15 update for the 2023 Razr Plus, so you can start enjoying all the new features right away. It should also get Android 16 later in the year, but anything beyond that is questionable. We revisited the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">2revisited the 3023 Razr Plus</a> after using it nearly daily for a year, and we're happy to note that the phone held up fairly well despite its delayed Android 14 update. Performance is still smooth, apps and games run well, and unfortunately, what was bad is still the same.</p><p>The 2025 Razr Plus ships with Android 15 and comes with some new features that are currently exclusive to the 2025 series. These include Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and Remember This, among other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI features</a>. We found Group Shot to be an interesting new camera feature for taking group photos. Many of these features should make it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr Plus</a> model since they share the same processor, but we might not see them on the 2023 model.</p>

<p>If you have the budget or were looking for an upgrade from the 2023 Razr Plus, the new 2025 model offers just the right upgrades to keep you happy, while still being familiar. Technically, you could get the 2024 Razr Plus, too, if you find it on sale for $200 (or more) lower than the 2025 model; otherwise, you might as well get the latest one if the price difference isn't much.</p><p>I'd choose the 2025 model over the 2023 model purely because of better battery life, cameras, and the IP48 rating. Plus, it doesn't hurt to have longer software support and useful AI features.</p><p>Having said that, our Managing Editor Derrek Lee's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">long-term verdict</a> on the 2023 Razr Plus is that if you can live with the compromises of the weak battery life and average cameras, it's hard to beat at its current discounted price. As of writing this article, the 2023 Razr Plus is on sale on Amazon for just $500, making it an insanely good value.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is likely still a few months away, but there's already a lot to look forward to about the device. We have talked about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8</a> possibly being the first smartwatch to run Wear OS 6, adding new health features, and bringing an "innovative" design. But the thing everyone wants to know is how the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 will stack up against the existing Google Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 and the current Galaxy Watch 7 already have key differences, as the former offers style and simplicity while the latter provides a more advanced feature set. That should continue with the next Galaxy Watch 8, based on Samsung's public teasers about the device. Let's dive into how these two Wear OS smartwatches might compare based on current rumors, leaks, and speculation.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Rumors indicate that Samsung will host a Galaxy Unpacked event in New York City sometime in mid-July, and this is likely when we'll see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> for the first time. For reference, the last two Galaxy Watch models were released on July 10 and July 26 in 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p><p>If pricing holds from the Galaxy Watch 7 series, we're looking at $299 for the 40mm Galaxy Watch 8 and $329 for the 44mm Galaxy Watch 8. There aren't any rumors pointing to price hikes at the moment, but with the ongoing uncertainty regarding U.S. tariffs, there's always a good chance costs could increase when new products are announced.</p><p>Luckily, we do know exactly how much the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> costs, as it has been out for more than half a year. Here's the full pricing breakdown:</p>

<p>There haven't been many Galaxy Watch 8 leaks to date that reveal Samsung's design plans, but we may not need to speculate much. In the company's Q1 2025 earnings call, Corporate VP of MX Division Daniel Araujo teased its upcoming smartwatch, which will have a new design.</p><p>Samsung plans to grow its wearable market "with a strengthened premium experience while expanding our lineup across all price segments," Araujo said. "We plan to launch a new Galaxy Watch with an innovative design and enhanced health-related features."</p><p>As for what that "innovative design" might be, there have been reported rumblings internally at Samsung about switching to a squircle wearable design, like the 2014 Samsung Gear S. However, it seems unlikely this is the path Samsung will take with the Galaxy Watch 8, as Apple seems to have claimed the squircle form factor with the abundantly successful Apple Watch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d4YctZJs5WUyJHBJq7YKrG" name="Samsung-Gear-S-display.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Gear S display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d4YctZJs5WUyJHBJq7YKrG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Alex Dobie / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, we could be looking at a hybrid of sorts, with a squircle chassis and a circular inset screen. This would mimic the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, bringing it down to the standard models. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-series-imagery-squircle-quick-button-leaks">set of leaked images</a>, shown below, gives us a glimpse of what that might look like.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.99%;"><img id="rA8x92xSnWTA8k4dJkeC4V" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leaked-graphics" alt="A set of leaked graphics of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 and 8 Classic with a "squircle" design and a "Quick" button on the latter." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rA8x92xSnWTA8k4dJkeC4V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="962" height="327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A set of leaked graphics of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 and 8 Classic with a "squircle" design and a "Quick" button on the latter. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> is offered in 40mm and 44mm case sizes, and we expect these to remain similar on the Galaxy Watch 8. The wild card here is the smartwatch's new design, because a different shape or display aspect ratio could tweak the watch's case size or screen size. As for durability, we can expect an IP68 dust and water-resistance rating and MIL-STD-810H certification for shock protection.</p><p>Compared to the Pixel Watch 3's "waterdrop" design, any iteration of Galaxy Watch 8 design is going to look different. The Pixel Watch 3 has a circular design with black bezels that help the display blend into the frame, and is offered in 41mm and 45mm sizes. It has a recycled aluminum case that can be configured in matte or polished finishes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="V4LxpJjZ88vsDoXPQrbNrg" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-water" alt="A close up of an info-packed watch face on the Google Pixel Watch 3, held above a pond" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4LxpJjZ88vsDoXPQrbNrg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a crown on the right side of the watch that is used for navigation, providing haptic feedback as you scroll. You also get another button for controls and power options.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, the Pixel Watch 3 has slimmer display bezels, a higher 60Hz refresh rate, and a brighter 2,000 nits of peak brightness. However, those figures simply help the Pixel Watch 3 catch up to the Galaxy Watch 7. That's why the Galaxy Watch 8 will likely continue this trend, and unless you like the Pixel Watch 3's minimalist design, the Samsung offering feels superior.</p>

<p>Due to regulatory filings, we have a better idea of the Galaxy Watch 8's hardware than its design. There will likely be a standard Galaxy Watch 8 and a Galaxy Watch 8 Classic available, with minor or no battery capacity increases.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/new-leak-hints-at-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8s-existence">Per a leak</a>, the larger Galaxy Watch 8 will receive a 10mAh capacity bump, bringing the total capacity to 435mAh. Meanwhile, the 40mm variant will see no change in capacity, suggesting both models will retain their 40-hour battery estimate.</p><p>By comparison, the Pixel Watch 3 has a more limited 24-hour battery life estimate. For what it's worth, Android Central's testers found that the Pixel Watch 3 often outperformed that figure. Battery life is likely to be worse compared to the Galaxy Watch 8 in either case.</p>

<p>While Samsung has given the Galaxy Watch a new processor for the last two generations, it's unclear if that trend will continue. No leaks point to a new chip, but it's always possible. For now, we know that the Galaxy Watch 8 may at least have the Exynos W1000 chip, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage — matching the Galaxy Watch 7.</p><p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 is equipped with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oppo-watch-3-official-qualcomm-next-gen-snapdragon-wear-platform">Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 5100 chip</a> and a Cortex-M33 co-processor, plus 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Both the Pixel Watch 3 and the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 should be more than capable of handling all your smartwatch needs.</p><p>The following is a specs table comparing expected, rumored, or assumed Galaxy Watch 8 specs to the Pixel Watch 3, but it should be noted that hardware leaks have been extremely limited so far. We'll have to wait until the Galaxy Watch 8 is closer to an official release before we have a definitive idea of what hardware it will offer.</p>

<p>Software and health sensing is where the Galaxy Watch 8 may pull away from the Pixel Watch 3. Our testers found that while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> can handle basic activity tracking and running workouts, other workout metrics are less reliable. Plus, there have been inconsistent experiences with GPS data on the Pixel Watch 3. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Watch 8 is known for offering more detailed data with better hardware sensors.</p><p>That should continue with the Galaxy Watch 8. We know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">Samsung is working on blood-glucose monitoring technology</a> based on patent filings, but it's not clear whether this feature could be ready for the brand's next smartwatch.</p><p>Either way, it'll feature the new Samsung BioActive Sensor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">added to the Galaxy Watch 7</a>, which hasn't reached its full potential yet. Given that a Samsung executive teased new health features at its recent earnings call, it's safe to expect the Galaxy Watch 8 to add new tools and metrics using that BioActive Sensor.</p>

<p>Right now, it's too early to say whether the Galaxy Watch 8 will be better than the Pixel Watch 3. If you're after AI features and advanced health metrics, there's a good chance Samsung's upcoming smartwatch will impress. However, the Pixel Watch 3 is catered more to a casual audience, and it's unlikely the Galaxy Watch 8 will beat Google's smartwatch in that regard.</p><p>Of course, more leaks and rumors will continue to pile in as the Galaxy Watch 8 launch gets closer, so stay tuned to our coverage for more.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) — usually observed on the third Thursday of May every year — Samsung showcased its capabilities of Auracast technology and organized an event in London in conjunction with hearing aid maker GN.</p><p>Together, both companies had an event at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London last Friday (May 16) where the attendees were wearing Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>/ GN hearing aids paired with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast,</a> allowing them to experience shared listening from a single audio source.</p>

<p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/global-accessibility-awareness-day-samsung-auracast-transforms-cathedral-acoustics-with-unmatched-audio-clarity/">shared newsroom post</a>, Samsung further goes on to explain what’s actually went on at the event — “Auracast microphones and transmitters will broadcast audio directly into participants’ Galaxy Buds3 Pro or GN hearing aids, decreasing background noise to enhance clarity.”</p><p>Prior to the May 16th event, Samsung even had a pilot event in May to showcase the potential of Auracast, wherein the participants seemed to have shared their experiences as well.</p><p>“The experience with the tour guide was amazing,” said one participant.</p><p>“Ordinarily I wouldn’t be able to join in with the tour because I would be unable to hear properly, but today it was completely different. This technology allowed me to hear everything so clearly so I didn’t miss a word.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4atpUko5ZahdGFqABcWrSV" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-hero-closeup.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4atpUko5ZahdGFqABcWrSV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Auracast feature allows users to enable “simultaneous audio streaming to multiple devices, listeners can enjoy a unified and enriched experience whether using earbuds or a compatible hearing aid."</p><p>The Auracast utilizes LE Audio — the power-efficient and higher-quality Bluetooth wireless transmission technology, which has been adopted by various Samsung products like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and even the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a>, also got the support through a software update.</p><p>Other than the shared audio experiences, other notable benefits of Auracast include seamless audio hand-off, better audio clarity, and personalized sound, which can be tweaked through settings — helping users with varying hearing abilities.</p><p>The London event is an indication of Samsung’s commitment to accessibility and to be able to redefine hearing accessibility for users through its products. Auracast is set to be playing a significant role in bridging the gap between consumer audio and compatible hearing devices — all to ensure a better listening experience.</p>

<p>The Garmin Forerunner 570 and 970 are more expensive than their predecessors. Other 2025 Garmin watches skimped on new features to keep prices low, so I'm happy Garmin didn't hold back on its Forerunners. But it's also become clearer that Garmin doesn't feel a need to compete with other brands' features — only against itself.</p><p>The jump between the $599 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> and $749 Forerunner 970 is significant. You get the newest Elevate v5 generation for better HR accuracy, ECGs and skin temperature readings, flashlight, mic & speaker for calling and commands, sapphire crystal protection, and new metrics like running tolerance.</p><p>Or if you're weighing the $549 Forerunner 270 against the $449 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>, you also get the gen5 HR accuracy boost, doubled screen brightness on a larger display, the same mic & speaker, and skin temperature with heat acclimation.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Vivoactive 6</a> stuck to last-gen HR sensors, treading water on hardware so that Garmin could keep them in their fixed price ranges. I feared Garmin would do the same with its Forerunners, making us wait until 2027 for real changes.</p><p>That's why I'm excited for the Forerunner 970, but also feeling frustrated at how Garmin holds back mid-tier watches like the Forerunner 570.</p>

<p>The $499 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Instinct 3 didn't have offline maps</a> despite being an "adventure" watch, while cheaper rival watches like the $349 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS PACE Pro</a> and Suunto Race S did. I complained at the time, but Garmin hadn't given it storage space for maps, prioritizing a lightweight CPU for battery life.</p><p>The $549 Forerunner 570 <em>does</em> have storage space for maps, and no need to hold back the processor. There's no logistical reason it <em>shouldn't</em> support maps; even if they're not pre-downloaded like on the 970, Garmin could let you download a specific region's topo data, at least.</p><p>The only real explanation is that their absence makes people more likely to pay for the 970.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en" name="Garmin-Venu-3-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG summary page on the Garmin Venu 3 saying the author's sinus rhythm is normal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The same applies to the 570 health sensors. I obviously appreciate the enhanced HR accuracy and skin temperature. But every other gen5 watch has ECGs, including the $449 Venu 3. And outside of Garmin, ECGs are the norm, from mainstream watches to fitness rivals like the COROS APEX and Polar Vantage series.</p><p>But Garmin ignores the context of its rivals; the only competitor that matters is the Forerunner 970. That needs to stand out, so the 570 misses out. Heart health warnings become a $750 bargaining chip.</p><p>It's a common-enough strategy for Garmin. With the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a>, you can't see your training load even though it clearly <em>calculates</em> load in the background to determine your VO2 Max, recovery time, and daily suggested workouts with anaerobic or low aerobic focuses. Blocking that data upsells you to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>.</p><p>I accepted <em>that</em> artificial feature block because the 165 costs $249, and training load is still fairly niche. But Garmin watch prices keep creeping up. It's harder to swallow blocked features when these mid-tier models cost much more than a Galaxy or Apple Watch.</p>
<h2 id="with-garmin-watches-every-component-has-a-price-tag-2">With Garmin watches, every component has a price tag</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="iRg7gPJWU45C5rK9RAWsnF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-mic-calling" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 rendered in a black void, angled from the bottom to emphasize the titanium bezel and the screen showing a phone call." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRg7gPJWU45C5rK9RAWsnF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smartwatch "tiers" are common enough these days, and every company wants to upsell you. But they're also selective about which features are price-locked because they know it'll look bad if a competitor offers something for much less.</p><p>You obviously pay more for steel or titanium casing, or other hardware boosts like better battery life. But otherwise, they squeeze most features into the mainline model while sticking to the same pricing every year (aside from the occasional inflationary boost).</p><p>With Garmin, every new feature to modernize its watches comes with a price bump. MIP-to-AMOLED display swaps for the Forerunner and Instinct lineups cost tacked on another $50–100 to the usual price. On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, collectively adding AMOLED, better sensors, and a mic & speaker added $200 to the price.</p><p>You won't find dual-band GPS on any watch $300 or less, nor offline maps on any sub-$600 watch. And even though Garmin's Gen5 HR sensors came out in 2023, it will keep using the Gen4 sensors on "cheaper" models like the $500 Instinct 3 today.</p><p>I don't know how much the components cost Garmin, but it wants <em>us</em> to know that it'll pass that cost onto us.</p>

<p>Other factors like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">tariff concerns</a> bump up pricing, too. But Garmin's 2025 strategy establishes a clear Garmin precedent: Once a watch costs a certain price, you shouldn't expect new hardware at that price, nor features already established at the flagship tier.</p><p>The next version will either cost the same but make minimal upgrades, or add new tools and cost much more.</p><p>Garmin treats any new feature as an opportunity to ask athletes for more money in exchange for more value. And it can do this because it doesn't feel as much pressure to price its fitness watches competitively as other brands.</p><p>Garmin users like its ecosystem too much — or are too invested in it — to leave. And so Garmin accepts the negative press around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect+ paywalled features</a> and price-locks the coolest new features because its loyal customers will pay $750 or more for them, even if they grumble about it.</p><p>If you think the Forerunner 970 and 570 are too expensive, then at least you know the last-gen Garmin watches are still available — and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/amazon-quietly-drops-huge-sale-on-garmin-smartwatches-here-are-the-5-deals-that-matter">discounted for Memorial Day</a>, so a Forerunner 965 costs $50 less than the 570.</p><p>Otherwise, we have to accept this new normal with new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>.</p>
