If you believe it is, you'll want to do your research on what size Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 or 8 Classic you should buy. There are significant design differences between the regular Watch 8 and the Classic model.

There are three case sizes in total: 40mm, 44mm, and 46mm. You can get the Galaxy Watch 8 in 40mm or 44mm sizes, with both options available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/which-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-color-should-you-buy">Graphite and Silver colorways</a> each. Meanwhile, the upsized Galaxy Watch 8 Classic with the popular rotating bezel is only available in one 46mm case size. Customers can choose from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/which-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-color-should-you-buy">Black and White color options</a> when shopping for the Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>Choosing the right case size when buying a wearable depends on the size of your wrists. If you've got big hands, a larger case size like 44mm or 46mm, is best suited. Something as small as 40mm may not be proportional and might end up looking strange or funny. You don't want to seem like you accidentally wore a kids' smartwatch.</p><p>Naturally, the petite 40mm case size looks the most aesthetically pleasing on tinier wrists. It's also more functional. You don't want an oversized, chunky wearable that covers the entirety of your wrist, feels heavy, and ends up knocking around every single thing in close proximity to your hands.</p><p>Small wrists have a disadvantage when looking at the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, because it only comes in a gigantic 46mm case size. So you'll be stuck between the Watch 8's 40mm or 44mm variants if you have smaller hands.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This year, Samsung added the best mobile processor, a 200MP main camera sensor, and a refreshed thin-and-light design to its premium Fold. However, Galaxy Z Fold users might have also gotten something they <em>didn't</em> want, and that's the $2,000 starting price of the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>For those keeping track at home, that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> the most expensive Samsung foldable to ever launch in the U.S. It's even pricier than the original Galaxy Z Fold that launched in 2019 for $1,980. Of course, inflation, tariff uncertainty, and a host of other factors might explain the price hike, but this just goes to show that the decision of whether to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is more complicated than ever.</p><p>People considering an upgrade will have to look at their current phone and figure out whether having the newest Samsung foldable is worth the high cost. For anyone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">recent foldable</a> from Samsung, Google, or OnePlus, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is probably out of reach — unless you take advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deals">insane pre-order trade-in deals</a>. It's easier to justify an upgrade with an older model because the changes compound across multiple generations.</p><p>Let's dive into the Galaxy Z Fold 7's price and specs to help you figure out whether you should upgrade or pass.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-from-a-galaxy-z-fold-6-2">Should you upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 from a Galaxy Z Fold 6?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5naTkQoLMYoejCq4GVAp3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-mint-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5naTkQoLMYoejCq4GVAp3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> was already a standout foldable, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 builds off those initial upgrades. Is there enough added to the newer model to make current owners want to upgrade? That probably depends on who you ask. There are a lot of noticeable changes, but it'll be tough to justify spending $2,000 on a foldable just one year after spending $1,900 on the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">major differences between these two models</a> will be their display sizes and form factors. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has bigger inner and outer screens, measuring 8 inches on the main display and 6.5 inches on the cover screen. That's up from a 7.6-inch main screen and a 6.3-inch cover screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Most importantly, the newer model has a wider cover screen, which should make typing and general use more comfortable.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications </caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folding display</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2184 x 1968 QXGA+</p></td><td  ><p>7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2160 x 1856 resolution, 20.9:18 aspect ratio, 374 ppi, 2600 nits peak brightness, 480Hz PWM dimming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover display</p></td><td  ><p>6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 2520 x 1080 HD+, Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2376 x 968 resolution, 22.1:9 aspect ratio, 410 ppi, 2600 nits peak brightness, 480Hz PWM dimming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating System</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (One UI 8)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (One UI 6.1.1) [upgradeable]</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor </p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery </p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging </p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5 reverse wireless</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5 reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras </p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie cameras </p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 10MP (folding display)</p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 4MP (folding display)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9 mm (folded); 158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2 mm (unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>Folded (68.1 x 153.5 x 12.1 mm); Unfolded (132.6 x 153.5 x 5.6 mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>215g</p></td><td  ><p>239g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Silver Shadow, Blue Shadow, Jetblack</p></td><td  ><p>Silver, Shadow, Pink, Navy</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is <em>significantly</em> thinner and lighter than its predecessor, which is probably the most compelling reason to upgrade. It's only 8.9mm thick when closed, and that means you can add a case to it if you'd like while still remaining under the Galaxy Z Fold 7's 12.1mm thickness. Meanwhile, the new version weighs only 215 grams, and that's less than every big flagship from Apple, Google, and Samsung.</p><p>Hardware upgrades are a mixed bag. The new model has the advantage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip</a> and a 200MP camera, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6's comparable offerings are no slouch. You probably won't notice that big of a difference in performance during daily use. Plus, the amount of RAM, battery capacity, and charging speed is completely unchanged between models.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 half-opened with the display on.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it would be nice to have the thinner and lighter Galaxy Z Fold 7, most Galaxy Z Fold 6 users should probably stick with the phone they have for another year. I recently put a SIM back into the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, and it's an excellent foldable that still holds up in 2025. It was tough to go from Galaxy S25 Edge to a thicker device, and I absolutely noticed a difference holding the Galaxy Z Fold 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>Still, we're talking about $2,000 here. Unless you have boatloads of cash, there just isn't enough to justify the upgrade from the prior model. And this isn't a knock on Samsung — I don't think there's <em>anything</em> that could make me justify spending $2,000 annually on new foldable phones.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-from-an-older-galaxy-2">Should you upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 from an older Galaxy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AyWqFJxSNfYNphoXTCDSPL" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-13.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyWqFJxSNfYNphoXTCDSPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, the situation changes a bit when we're talking about older Samsung Galaxy models. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, which is only two years old, is starting to show its age. It has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip that wasn't built for the AI era, and a 6.2-inch cover screen that isn't wide enough by 2025 standards. Additionally, the phone's 252-gram weight and 13.4mm thickness when folded is pretty chunky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5">compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>There are positives to sticking with the Galaxy Z Fold 5, as it has the same battery capacity, charging speed, and secondary cameras as the newer Galaxy Z Fold 7. While some things are way better on the newer model, others are exactly the same.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LsUgPUqdiJTcnSKTa76yv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Circle to Search mid-game hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LsUgPUqdiJTcnSKTa76yv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's bigger main screen.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a> or older, the situation becomes a bit clearer. These Galaxy foldables had the older wedge-shaped hinge with a gap between the two halves of the phone. This not only made the foldables thicker but also less durable. Samsung's hinge design and build quality have vastly improved since this generation of foldables, and there are many reasons to upgrade.</p><p>For those with a Galaxy Z Fold 5 or a Galaxy Z Fold 4, an upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 makes a lot of sense. Samsung is offering $900 of trade-in credit for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and $800 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 toward the newer model, which is excellent. It means your device will have retained about half of its value even after two or three years of use. If you like the Galaxy Z Fold form factor and have no regrets, I'd jump on this Galaxy Z Fold 7 pre-order offer now before your phone loses value.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-from-a-pixel-fold-pixel-9-pro-fold-or-oneplus-open-2">Should you upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 from a Pixel Fold, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or OnePlus Open?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anyone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a>, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or OnePlus Open should probably take a pause before jumping toward the new Galaxy Z Fold 7. For starters, switching from phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and OnePlus Open to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is more like a lateral move. Many of Samsung's new additions, like a wider cover screen and thin form factor, have been staples of Google and OnePlus foldables.</p><p>For example, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the thinnest foldable available in the U.S., the Pixel 9 Pro Fold measures 10.5mm when folded, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/you-should-love-the-oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> measures 11.7mm when folded. Both of those are still thinner than the Galaxy Z Fold 6. So, even though Samsung's changes are impressive, they seem better because of how far behind Galaxy Z Fold models already were.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VkZ6nwWXb3q7SN5ammb5v3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-13" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in Tent Mode hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VkZ6nwWXb3q7SN5ammb5v3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As such, if you're an owner of a Google or OnePlus foldable, I'd recommend waiting to see what the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> holds.

For owners of the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, OnePlus Open, or even an Honor or Oppo foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 isn't going to feel as impactful of an upgrade.</p><p>To figure out whether you need to upgrade, think about the ways your current phone isn't cutting it. Evaluate whether the Galaxy Z Fold 7's upgrades — a thinner and lighter design, bigger main and cover screens, and a 200MP camera sensor — will address those concerns. Finally, decide whether you can afford to spend $2,000 to fix your current device's shortcomings.</p><p>Remember that you can walk into your nearest Best Buy store to try out the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 for yourself — that's how I got my hands on it before release day.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c749f321-4c35-402e-a736-8ded4d096094">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A worthy upgrade</strong></em></p><p>If you have an older Fold or are trying one out for the first time, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best foldable we've seen come to the U.S. However, anyone with a recent big-screen foldable might find it hard to justify the $2,000 price tag. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

That streak will soon be broken, as the RG477M was announced in a 21-second video published to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@anbernic">Anbernic's YouTube channel</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RBArKfpkZE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The company didn't provide any further details besides showing off some quick B-roll footage. This confirmed the metal shell along with the button, joystick, and D-pad placement. And although it wasn't mentioned, it's safe to assume that the joysticks will have RGB lighting, based on the close-up shots in the video.</p><p>However, based on Anbernic's history, there are a few gaps we can try to fill just from the name. With only a couple of exceptions, the majority of Anbernic handhelds carry a naming scheme of "RGXXYZZ," and are broken down as such:</p><ul><li><strong>XX -</strong> Screen Size</li><li><strong>Y - </strong>Processor</li><li><strong>ZZ -</strong> Version</li></ul><p>So, looking at the RG477M, Anbernic's next handheld will feature a 4.7-inch screen. The "7" likely denotes a more powerful chip, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gemini-notebooklm-gaming-guide-creation">RG557</a>, making use of the MediaTek Dimensity 8300. And the "M" simply denotes that it will feature a metal shell.</p><p>Provided that Anbernic doesn't throw a curveball, it's pretty safe to assume that the RG477M will feature similar internals to those of the RG557. In addition to the Dimensity 8300, the RG557 includes 12GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="nVK46NxPnCeAFZm4VY96mb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-6" alt="Anbernic RG477M promo banner render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVK46NxPnCeAFZm4VY96mb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RNffGvaN4E7ZKVHPcJGAkb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-4" alt="Anbernic RG477M bronze shell - angled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNffGvaN4E7ZKVHPcJGAkb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="QbCNu6FgSCu7rwZTfBeajb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-5" alt="Anbernic RG477M silver/gunmetal close-up on left joystick" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbCNu6FgSCu7rwZTfBeajb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One interesting tidbit to note is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rgslide">Anbernic RG Slide</a> from June features a 4.7-inch IPS display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1280x960 resolution. It wouldn't come as any surprise if Anbernic ended up using the same panel from the RG Slide in the forthcoming RG477M.</p><p>That being said, we probably won't have to wait very long to learn more about what Anbernic has been working on. Once the initial teaser video is released, the company usually trickles out more information on a semi-rapid pace, leading up to pre-orders being made available. Given that retro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> with metal shells don't come around very often, I'll be keeping a close eye on the launch of the RG477M.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Diving in supposedly provided the tipster with Google's early design of the feature. Reminiscent of At a Glance, Gemini Spaces will seemingly appear as a widget users can place on their home and lock screens.</p><p>Regarding the latter, the Gemini Spaces card will appear above your Pixel's lock screen clock if the larger numbers are used. If the smaller clock is chosen, the cards will appear right beneath it. The cards on the home screen seem relatively the same; however, the tipster offered a look at its Sports and Calendar event (birthday), which delivered a transparent background for the latter.</p><p>Another important detail is the dots right beneath Gemini Spaces cards.</p><p>These dots seem to indicate users can swipe through whatever Gemini has procured for the user. AssembleDebug was able to swipe from some sports scores to the calendar event, and it looks like there's room for more (if only Google had it working). The tipster adds that these cards should display finance information alongside what was already working early on. Considering Gemini's involvement, it's likely we'll see a whole host of topics/genres available in its new "Spaces" cards.</p><h2 id="gemini-becomes-integral-2">Gemini becomes integral</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="SZUbz5m4VKo44PMkJrU3NJ" name="google-gemini-spaces-at-a-glance-lock-screen-leak" alt="A leaked screenshot of Google's "Gemini Spaces" redesign for At a Glance showing a birthday calendar event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SZUbz5m4VKo44PMkJrU3NJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="SDf8W3Hdgk5PjVuZLZzFNJ" name="google-gemini-spaces-at-a-glance-home-screen-leak" alt="A screenshot leak of a Pixel's home screen, showing sports scores, courtesy of Google's rumored "Gemini Spaces" feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDf8W3Hdgk5PjVuZLZzFNJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>In June, Google's development of "Gemini Spaces" was reported. Those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-give-at-a-glance-a-gemini-makeover-with-extra-smarts">early reports</a> claim the feature was similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung's Now Bar</a>, a feature that delivers real-time information on whatever your interests are. It was originally reported to be a feature for your lock screen, but as we've now seen, it seems Google plans for this to be a true Gemini-fueled successor to At a Glance for your home screen, too.</p><p>The initial report was mostly code; however, that early code showed Gemini Spaces is aiming to "go beyond" what At a Glance can currently do: weather and calendar events. Only finance information and sports scores have been alleged, but it's not hard to imagine what else Gemini can pull for us. Perhaps sales on products we like or quick news blurbs.</p><p>What's more interesting is how much of Android Gemini is moving into. The AI has truly become a part of Google's vision <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-exec-android-gemini-future-os-interview-report">about the future of Android</a>, according to its president of Android Ecosystem, Sameer Samat. Not only is Google planning to merge ChromeOS with Android, but Gemini is taking center stage. Per Samat, Gemini has turned Android into a "helpful experience," which the company undoubtedly plans to evolve.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the app can already "assemble high-quality sources" for users researching hard topics, Google states this update will make things even easier. For this, the post states two new partners, the Atlantic and the Economist, have helped to create public notebooks, such as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/750a23df-fd98-4954-b9c4-71f16c3ee937">How to Build a Life</a>" (Advice) and the analysis journal, "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/5881d15d-7b82-4002-8613-df59b6eece4c">The World Ahead 2025</a>," respectively.</p><p>Soon, when opening NotebookLM, users should notice a "featured notebooks" button beside "My notebooks" on its main page.</p><p>Google will produce several cards of its available featured notebooks with thumbnails, the number of sources, and their titles. These featured notebooks already have everything you'd need available, as well as the option to generate an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overview</a>. These topics, such as the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/19bde485-a9c1-4809-8884-e872b2b67b44">Complete Works of William Shakespeare</a>," have a mind map available to see how things connect.</p><p>Users retain the option to pose questions to the AI to get a little more understanding. However, if you're more interested in reading, you can certainly do that. Gemini's AI summary will be located at the top of those lengthy texts, just in case, too. NotebookLM's "featured notebooks" are rolling out today (July 14) for desktop computers.</p><h2 id="notebooklm-helps-streamline-learning-2">NotebookLM helps streamline learning</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUUZlcUgEis" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Users will also find these publicly available notebooks, courtesy of this new feature:</p><ul><li>Longevity advice from Eric Topol</li><li>A science fan’s guide to visiting Yellowstone National Park</li><li>An overview of long-term trends in human wellbeing, published by the University of Oxford-affiliated project, Our World In Data</li><li>Science-backed parenting advice from psychology professor Jacqueline Nesi</li><li>A notebook tracking the Q1 earnings reports from the top 50 public companies worldwide</li></ul><p>The feature currently rolling out for NotebookLM feels like an extension of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/public-notebooks-are-coming-to-notebooklm-for-easy-sharing-and-studying">Public Notebooks</a>, which debuted in June. Kind of like sharing a Google Doc, users can compile their latest notebook in the app and share a link with other users, so they can see and interact with it, too. Considering NotebookL:M is about studying and learning about topics in a way that doesn't feel so heavy, teachers and other educators may find this useful.</p><p>Topics that you need to teach or learn about take center stage without all the other fluff that doesn't matter. Moreover, your sources are clear, and if you need to scour the internet for them, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM would take care of it</a>.</p><p>Google rolled out Discover Sources in the app this spring, which takes away the necessity for users to search around manually for important sources. Now, users need only describe their topic and let NotebookLM look around and add in what's important. The AI will display what it found, leaving it in the user's hands to go through and check off which ones they want and don't want.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The device was reportedly spotted moving through the World Power Consortium (WPC) for certification purposes. There, the Qi2 wireless standard was noted; however, the listing failed to detail its charging strength. The flagship Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-fast-samsung-galaxy-s25-charging-speed">boasts 15W wireless support</a>, so <em>maybe </em>we're looking at that here, too.</p><p>Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 series is also where it seems to want to bring its Galaxy S25 FE closer to—charging-wise, that is. The series, specifically the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra, features 45W wired support. Latest leaks claim the S25 FE will hop over the base S25 in terms of charging, just like last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-galaxy-s23-fe">S24 FE</a>, which only had 25W.</p><p>Early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">rumors from April</a> alleged Samsung was creating a Galaxy Tab S10 "Lite," which is seemingly an even more toned-down variant, under its FE line. While it might also see two-year-old Samsung tech—the Exynos 1380 SoC—a report claimed the company had started testing it with One UI 7. It suggests the device has "progressed" in its development cycle, as rumors purport a fall launch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-battery-specifications-leak">main Galaxy Tab S11 lineup</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The goal was simple: build a website using Gemini detailing the history of Android.</p><p>Since then, we've been a little busy around these parts, so the project was slightly delayed. I was determined to come up with a (mostly) final result, but wasn't really a fan of the site design that I shared before.</p><p>As a result, I basically started over, firing up Google AI Studio and using a combination of prompts and my own knowledge to reach the goal. So, without further ado, I introduce you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://androidrewind.com/">AndroidRewind.com</a>.</p><h2 id="android-rewind-2">Android Rewind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NFjPeACJRmYqqz2RQsoe6c" name="android-rewind-home-page-screenshot" alt="Android Rewind home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFjPeACJRmYqqz2RQsoe6c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3896" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Funnily enough, Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand recently published his own "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-evolution-of-android-decades-of-transformation">ode to Android</a>," providing snapshots of history since Google acquired Android Inc. back in July 2005. I implore you to check that out before anything else, as you'll get a Jerry-infused history lesson, and there's really nothing better than that.</p><p>As for Android Rewind, I wanted to provide digestible snippets about Android over the years. So you'll find the following landing pages:</p><ul><li><strong>Releases - A timeline of every major version of Android:</strong> Each entry shows the Codename, Release month/year, and Key Features.</li><li><strong>Devices - The hardware that defined generations of Android: </strong>Clicking a device will pull up the full name, OEM, release month/year, and a brief description.</li><li><strong>OEMs - The companies that build the hardware for the Android ecosystem: </strong>Select a company to view the name, primary location, and a bit about each company's impact.</li><li><strong>Notable Figures - The architects and visionaries behind Android: </strong>This one's pretty self-explanatory.</li></ul><p>Initially, the home page was nothing more than the header and a block of text at the top, along with the boxes at the bottom. But that was a bit too bland and boring for my taste, so I prompted Gemini to add a background image to the header section. More importantly, there's also the "Recent Release History," which is just an overview of the last five Android versions.</p><p>Almost all of the images you see on the site were sourced from the Android Central archives. With the exceptions being on the Figures page and images for the very early days of Android releases. Oh, right, and the actual website logo, which I asked Gemini to create and then tweaked to get what you see.</p><h2 id="lean-on-gemini-or-do-it-yourself-2">Lean on Gemini, or do it yourself</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3924px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3bAgZVNZbZgEcydFETvw2c" name="android-rewind-code-assistant-file-tree-preview" alt="Code Assistant with Files and Preview in Google AI Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3bAgZVNZbZgEcydFETvw2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3924" height="2208" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since basically this entire website is built using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, that means there's no "backend" or CMS for me to interact with. So after I managed to get most of the pieces in place, I realized I needed a way to edit the content on the page.</p><p>Following the path of least resistance, I just asked Gemini to make certain elements editable. Then, I realized that all I really needed to do was edit the website code myself.</p><p>That kind of speaks to the versatility of working with Gemini, at least from the confines of Google AI Studio. Basically, if you want or need Gemini to do the legwork for you, it's right there. But if you want to take a more hands-on approach, that's also at your disposal.</p><h2 id="a-few-headaches-2">A few headaches</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3931px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cfbkpJWrGtmwQgamaBcr2c" name="android-rewind-google-cloud-deployment-revisions" alt="Android Rewind Google Cloud Deployment History" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cfbkpJWrGtmwQgamaBcr2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3931" height="2211" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Gemini made all of this possible, not everything about building Android Rewind was smooth sailing. The most frustrating aspect was when I wanted to revisit the project at a later time, in order to make changes before the final push.</p><p>It turns out that even after connecting the created app to Google Cloud Run for deployment, there are a couple of ways that I lost progress. The first was actually clicking the "Deploy" button, which results in a pop-up that says the project was "successfully deployed to Google Cloud."</p><p>This is technically true, but it turns out that you have to click the "Redeploy app" if you make any changes to the code. There were a few times in the beginning when I would make changes and hit deploy, thinking that what appeared in the Preview window would be what showed up on the deployed site. That wasn't the case, so I ended up losing a few hours' worth of changes and manual tweaks.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="feePwDWyFAMZLb6avr5Cvb" name="android-rewind-google-cloud-project-deployment-message" alt="Android Rewind Google Cloud Project Deployment from AI Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/feePwDWyFAMZLb6avr5Cvb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other frustration I ran into is trying to edit the code after it's been deployed. One might think that you would be able to just come back to the same project in AI Studio later and pick up right where you left off.</p><p>Unless there's something I'm missing, that's not the case. So I had to dig through the Google Cloud Console to find the site code. After downloading the ZIP file, I opened up the initial project in AI Studio, then copied and pasted all of the contents into the specific files, and created new ones where necessary.</p><p>This is something that both Claude and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">ChatGPT</a> excel at, as I can close a window and pick right back up where I left off by selecting the pertinent "conversation." Hell, I can even upload an entire ZIP file to either of those and have it make edits for me, while AI Studio only lets me upload individual files and not entire projects.</p><h2 id="looking-to-the-future-2">Looking to the future</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3884px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="AzMrjDtjwDZEaJPxcSvD3c" name="android-rewind-android-release-details" alt="Android Rewind Release window" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AzMrjDtjwDZEaJPxcSvD3c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3884" height="2184" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm pretty happy with the current state of Android Rewind, at least for now. I'm sure that others will tell me about things that are missing, but I'm also going to eventually add more information where it makes sense.</p><p>First, I will add more details to each Android Release and Device entry. I've also toyed around with the idea of having dedicated OEM pages, providing a list of every major device release. Admittedly, I did think about having a full device history, but then I remembered just how many devices Samsung releases any given year, which quickly changed my mind.</p><p>More importantly, I will soon be adding devices like tablets, wearables, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> to the mix. These are all just as important to the history of Android as phones, but for the sake of getting the site launched, I decided to omit them for now.</p><p>Be sure to keep an eye on Android Rewind, as the changes will (hopefully) come swiftly, and with Gemini at my side.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It builds on the original Balance with new features, including HYROX training, scuba support, and a brighter sapphire-glass display. Battery life remains a highlight, easily lasting up to two weeks in everyday use. While it's heavier than past models, it still looks sharp enough to wear all day.</p><p>The Amazfit Balance 2 pushes even closer to Wear OS territory, offering features such as Bluetooth calling through its built-in speaker and microphone. It also supports smart replies with a full QWERTY keyboard, making it easier to respond on the go. You'll find a solid mix of built-in apps, NFC for payments via Zepp Pay. The large 1.5-inch AMOLED display is bright enough for Outdoor use, and the upgraded sapphire glass and aluminum frame give the watch a premium, durable feel.</p><p>That said, the Balance 2 isn't without its drawbacks.

It keeps the familiar rectangular design that many users love, but upgrades the experience with a larger, sharper 1.97-inch AMOLED display. The lightweight aluminum frame strikes a good balance between style and durability, and at 27.9 grams without the strap, it's comfortable enough for all-day use. You can choose from a range of colors, including black, charcoal, stone, and red.</p><p>The 14-day battery life is comparable to that of some of the more expensive Amazfit watches on this list, which is impressive. When you compare that to competitors that last for a day or two, this is a great accomplishment. The Amazfit Bip 6 offers over 140 sports modes, including popular options like outdoor running, strength training, and cycling. You'll also find more specialized activities, such as HYROX racing, yoga, and high-intensity interval training, providing fitness enthusiasts with a wide range of options.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-under-100"><span>Best under $100</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2587px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="keaEodb2MAR2ugvAA5t9YE" name="Amazfit-active-2" alt="Amazfit Active 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/keaEodb2MAR2ugvAA5t9YE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2587" height="1455" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazfit)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-amazfit-active-2-2"><span class="title__text">3.

The polycarbonate watch body is available in two unique colors: Desert Black and Sahara. The 1.3-inch AMOLED display has a touchscreen for easy navigation and four side buttons that you can use to navigate the watch if that's your preferred method. The best thing about this design is that it's tough and ideal for outdoor enthusiasts since it has military-grade durability. The Amazfit T-Rex Ultra is easily one of the toughest watches, as it has passed 15 military-grade tests instead of 12 on the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-t-rex-review">Amazfit T-Rex</a>.</p><p>No matter how long you plan to be outdoors, this is also one of the best Amazfit smartwatches for extended battery life. You can expect this beast to last up to 20 days with typical use. Those who use their smartwatch heavily can expect an average of around 12 days. In continuous GPS mode, the battery will last for 28 hours, and you can get as much as 80 hours from the endurance GPS mode. You also get an incredible water resistance rating. The Amazfit T-Rex Ultra can handle a depth of up to 100 meters, also known as 10 ATM water resistance.</p><p>Speaking of tracking, most users will be happy with the Amazfit T-Rex Ultra's health and activity features. You'll have over 160 sports modes, including outdoor cycling, treadmill, trail running, and walking. You can also record specific activities like hiking, climbing, hunting, and more. During a workout, you can also track your route with the built-in advanced GPS.

This model offers better GPS features than most smartwatches, with the GPS antenna able to pick up 100% of satellite signals instead of the 50% that most watches can manage. As a result, the Cheetah Pro will let you track your route far more accurately than other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running smartwatches</a> on the market.</p><p>Its slew of features includes 24-hour monitoring of various metrics and multiple triathlete modes. These features make it well worth the price tag, along with over 100 apps and multiple face options to tailor the watch to suit your needs.</p><p>There are arguably <em>too</em> many features here, though, with hidden menus and an overwhelming number of options that don't work as well as they should. This suggests that Amazfit could have benefitted from a little more streamlining rather than going the route of "jack of all trades, master of none."</p><p>However, while running, the watch comes into its own, boasting an impressive 14-hour battery life and a super lightweight design. The price tag is competitive, too, with the number of features justifying a purchase for serious runners.</p><p>The touchscreen is bright and impressive, but it is a little inconsistent during use. Overall, though, the Cheetah Pro is impressive, but it is a little more niche than other offerings on this list. If you are into running, though, this is definitely the watch for you.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-battery"><span>Best battery</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="S9ZHSccc36QHj6CCdA4RoV" name="Amazfit Balance" alt="Amazfit Balance smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S9ZHSccc36QHj6CCdA4RoV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="6-amazfit-balance-2"><span class="title__text">6.

As with any smartwatch, you first ask yourself why you're getting it. Is it to keep track of steps, specific sports or activities, or get a good handle on your overall health and wellness? Then consider what else you want to do with it. Do you need access to third-party apps? Would you like to load music directly onto your watch? Do you want to read notifications and answer calls or texts directly from your wrist?</p><p>Create a list of features you want the watch to have, as well as the ones you need. Then, run through this list and eliminate or highlight models one by one. Soon, you'll be left with one or two models to choose from. From there, it might come down to price and design: Which one fits better on your wrist, suits your lifestyle, and is more affordable for your pocketbook?</p><p>The good news is that Amazfit has a smartwatch for just about everybody. When you focus on fitness, fashion, or both, you can find a model with everything you need. However, if you're looking for the absolute best Amazfit smartwatch, we highly recommend the Balance. It features a sleek design with fitness tracking capabilities, ensuring exceptional battery life.</p><p>To recap, the Amazfit Balance is equipped with over 150 sport modes, built-in GPS, sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, blood oxygen tracking, Amazon Alexa integration, and a microphone and speaker, allowing you to answer calls. It's not the type of watch that you'll have to charge every night, either. With average use, you might only need to charge it once a week.</p><p>Regardless of your preferences, you can likely find an Amazfit smartwatch that meets them. Whether you're a professional athlete looking to track your workouts and improve endurance, a runner training for the next big 5K, or a first-time user just getting started in the smartwatch world, there's bound to be a fitness-focused wearable from Amazfit that's perfect for you.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-we-test"><span>How we test</span></h3><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Why you can trust Android Central</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">☑️ One of the <strong>oldest and most trusted</strong> Android sites on the web<br>☑️ Over <strong>15 years</strong> of product testing<br>☑️ <strong>Thousands </strong>of products reviewed and tested since 2007<br>☑️ <strong>Dozens </strong>of smartwatches tested every year by our team</p></div></div><p>Testing smartwatches at Android Central involves much more than strapping them to our arms and taking a few pictures. Android Central Senior Editor Michael Hicks runs a weekly column called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">Sunday Runday</a>, where he discusses how smartwatches and exercise can help improve your life and promote health. Other smartwatch reviewers on the team, like Managing Editor Derrek Lee and Senior Editor Nicholas Sutrich, take numerous watches to the gym and competitions, putting them to the test exactly as you might.</p><p>In addition to comparing various watches during workouts, we wear each one to bed to evaluate sleep tracking and take them on long walks to test step accuracy. These everyday routines help us judge comfort, durability, and battery life over time. Therefore, when we recommend a smartwatch, it's because we've thoroughly tested it in real-world conditions and have the data to back it up.</p><p>Then there's the watch's operating system itself. Like Amazfit's smartwatches, many watches use proprietary operating systems that are compatible with Android and iOS devices. However, that can sometimes mean they aren't as full-featured as the OS made by Apple or Google. We take these things into account and ensure that you understand what might be missing from the experience on these watches, because, often, they excel in areas where watches from Google or Apple fall short.</p><p>Of course, all this affects how long a smartwatch's battery lasts. More features can sometimes mean worse battery life, but watches from brands like Amazfit or Garmin aim to help you stay healthier without requiring daily battery charging. We wear our watches for weeks or months to ensure accurate data and testing, so you can expect our battery life estimates to be exact.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both the inner and outer displays are AMOLED with 120Hz refresh rates, and the FlexWindow also utilizes Samsung's Vision Booster technology so you can use the screen in any light. </p><p>Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 boasts the powerful Exynos 2500 processor with all of the latest Galaxy AI-boosted software features. The phone also features seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed, and the 4,300mAh battery is the largest ever used in a Z Flip device.</p><p>The only problem is that the $1,099.99 price tag may put the Z Flip 7 out of reach for some folks, which is all the more reason why the T-Mobile deal above is so, so sweet. </p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-quick-links-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 / Z Flip 7 quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on: a new hope</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Unpacked 2025: your ultimate guide</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-deals">Galaxy Z Flip 7 preorder deals</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deals">Galaxy Z Fold 7 preorder deals</a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The teardown of the HeyMelody <strong>v115.8</strong> version has revealed new code referencing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-use-spotify-tap-samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro">Spotify Tap</a>.</p><p>For the unaware, Spotify Tap is a feature that lets users start playing tracks with a double tap or triple tap on compatible earbuds without the need to unlock the phone or open the Spotify app. The feature is already a prominent one on audio products made by Bose, Jabra, Sony, and Marshall or some Samsung Galaxy Buds, for that matter. The latest evidence suggests that OnePlus and Oppo are joining the list sooner.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:302px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:198.68%;"><img id="P6jkgftgDZRr5iNPF3Ce55" name="OnePlus-HeyMelody-Spotify-tap-feature" alt="Spotify Tap feature spotted for OnePlus/Oppo earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P6jkgftgDZRr5iNPF3Ce55.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="302" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication further notes that the mention of Spotify Tap in the HeyMelody app didn't specifically say whether it is for current audio products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/oneplus-buds-4-review">OnePlus Buds 4</a> via an update or tailored for the upcoming products from both the sibling companies.</p><p>Early testing, however, indicates that the alleged feature is in the works, and once enabled, users will be able to assign either a double or triple tap on the earbud connected to an Android phone to play their favorite song from Spotify and repeat the aforementioned process to switch to the next song.</p><h2 id="still-in-works-2">Still in works?</h2><p>These APK teardown findings need to be taken with a grain of salt as the feature needs more polishing, according to the publication.

However, going by the recent rumors of Samsung replacing the Plus model in favor of the Edge phone, the NPA2 is likely an indication of the next iteration of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>And according to the supposed database, either of the handsets is likely to feature an ultra-wide angle lens featuring a 50MP lens. If it turns out to be accurate, it marks a significant upgrade over the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and S25 Edge handsets.</p><p>Lastly, there isn't any notable information regarding the NPA1 model, which is likely the regular Galaxy S26 model. Since these are just specs based on the internal codenames and databases, things are likely to change when the devices launch officially sometime early next year, which is at least six months from now. So, consider the latest developments with a grain of salt.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Even though there was an "end of 2025" deadline, Samsung hasn't shared much about how things go forward, even in any of the recent Unpacked events held this year.</p><p>What this means is that the Galaxy AI features comprising Live Translate, Note Assist in Samsung Notes, Zoom Nightography, Audio Eraser, Browsing Assist, Generative Wallpapers, and several others that come by default on Galaxy phones, like the Galaxy S25 series, for instance, will remain free, which sounds promising.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dCRgAQhcjbG28XCcx6NSw3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-10" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Google Gemini hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCRgAQhcjbG28XCcx6NSw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, Google provides advanced features with paywalls like Gemini AI Pro and Ultra subscriptions.

HMD Global, the company behind Nokia-branded smartphones, is shifting its focus away from the U.S. market, leaving fans wondering what this means for the future of the Nokia brand.</p><p>HMD Global told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/705046/hmd-global-nokia-scaling-back-us-market" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that it is scaling back its presence in the U.S., which could mean no new Nokia phones will be launching stateside anytime soon. The company reiterated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-global/hmd-global-barbie-phone">existing devices will still get support</a>, meaning security updates and warranties will continue as promised.</p><p>The company is calling it “scaling back,” but it looks more like it's fully stepping away from selling phones in the U.S. It’s a quiet exit from a market HMD never quite managed to crack.</p><p>As it stands, all buy buttons are gone from HMD's product pages. You might still spot a few Nokia phones on places like Amazon, but those are probably just leftover inventories, and once they're gone, that’s likely it.</p><h2 id="tariffs-took-a-toll-2">Tariffs took a toll</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="ghtTu477BqoshoXmRuGhUa" name="Nokia-C1-Plus-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Nokia C1 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ghtTu477BqoshoXmRuGhUa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1535" height="863" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nokia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>HMD blames its U.S. retreat on geopolitical and economic challenges, which is basically a polite way of saying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/trumps-tariff-threat-now-targets-samsung-and-your-favorite-smartphones">U.S. tariffs made things too expensive to be worth it</a>. Higher costs, thinner profits, and the market just wasn’t working in its favor.</p><p>The U.S. smartphone market is a tough battleground, dominated by big players like Apple and Samsung. HMD struggled to gain traction with carriers and consumers, despite Nokia’s nostalgic appeal. Meanwhile, the company may be refocusing on markets where budget and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a> sell better.</p><p>Last year, it began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nokia-no-more-hmd-global-shifts-gears">moving away from the Nokia brand</a> to focus on creating original devices and building new partnerships.</p><p>To be clear, HMD is not closing shop. Right now, it is focused on making sure the exit doesn’t leave customers or partners hanging. Warranties, support, and service are still on the table, backed by its global teams.</p><p>HMD took over Nokia’s feature phone business from Microsoft back in 2016, after Microsoft had its own go at reviving the brand in 2014. At the same time, HMD scored a deal to use the Nokia name on budget and mid-range phones and tablets. That licensing deal runs until March 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With the new findings in the Canary build, it showcases Google's intent in enhancing protection for kids with the inclusion of supposedly robust controls as part of digital well-being, and we expect to see more of it in the upcoming releases, probably after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> series, which are set to launch sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id="coming-with-the-pixel-10-launch-2">Coming with the Pixel 10 launch?</h2><p>Pixel 10 models are anticipated to have an early launch, which is on August 20, following a similar approach from last year's models.

But <em>should</em> you upgrade to the Galaxy Watch 8, or should you hold off for the Galaxy Watch 9?</p><p>As the person who reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 and 6 Classic</a>, owns the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, reviewed the first-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, and is currently testing the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, I feel more than qualified to answer the question!</p><p>I'll talk about the polarizing Ultra-fication of the Watch 8 lineup, something my colleague Andrew discussed in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8 hands-on</a>. But whatever your tastes, upgraded specs and new Samsung Health features should matter just as much as design.</p><p>Here's the gist, if you're in a hurry: Galaxy Watch 7 owners have only one tentative reason to upgrade, but with a Galaxy Watch 6 (Classic) or older, you should be seriously tempted.</p><h2 id="the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-isn-t-as-different-as-it-looks-2">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 isn't as different as it looks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="e2XQUEGeVYWuj3GdMkZRJG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2XQUEGeVYWuj3GdMkZRJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 8 vs. 7</a>, it's immediately apparent how similar they are. They share the 3nm Exynos W1000 chip, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, dual-band GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity standards, and the latest BioActive Sensor suite with extra HR LEDs.</p><p>If you're switching from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Watch 6 to the Watch 8</a>, however, you do get a faster, more battery-efficient processor, dual-band GPS, more accurate health sensors with more data, faster charging, and doubled storage. Slightly more tempting, right?</p><p>Samsung slightly switched up its display sizes with the Watch 8: It measures 1.34 and 1.47 inches instead of 1.3 and 1.5, with a 326 pixels-per-inch ratio that's right in the usual ballpark. I doubt most people will notice that the display is different from previous years, aside from the extra brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-11" alt="The Galaxy Watch 8 (left) and Watch 8 Classic (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 8 (<em>left</em>) and Watch 8 Classic (<em>right</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is 1.1mm skinnier than the Watch 7, or 2mm thinner than the Watch 8 Classic. So even if it looks thick in photos, it's the opposite because Samsung redesigned its internals to shrink things down.</p><p>The photos above and below show what the Galaxy Watch 8 looks like in person. Active-style Galaxy Watches have cases that hug the display edge so it feels like one seamless package; now, the bezelless display looks more isolated and elevated, and the squircle aluminum case stands out more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pryAeGXhZDXVRmSfCcJUXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pryAeGXhZDXVRmSfCcJUXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Personally, I've always found Galaxy Watches to be comfortable and functional, but fairly boring and far from a "normal" watch look. So I don't mind the Galaxy Watch 8 design experiment, because it switches things up after years of monotonous repetition.</p><p>Both the Watch 8 and 7 look artificial; the newer model just leans into this a bit more. Samsung superfans might dislike it, but since this squircle redesign is probably here to stay, you may want to try it out and see if you like it in person.</p><p>My colleague Andrew prefers the Watch 8 Classic look more and doesn't mind heavier watches, but he admitted that the Watch 8 is light enough to "forget" you're wearing it. With the default band attached, the Watch 8 40mm and 44mm will only weigh about 52–56g, very reasonable and comfortable for a smartwatch.</p><h2 id="no-other-smartwatch-looks-like-the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-except-the-ultra-2">No other smartwatch looks like the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (except the Ultra)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dWtbcgRrNYoq22gE4hH4vZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in a top-down view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dWtbcgRrNYoq22gE4hH4vZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Galaxy Watch 6 Classic owners may feel conflicted about the Watch 8 Classic look, because the Ultra chic runs directly counter to the idea of a "classic" smartwatch design. But if you're strictly buying for the rotating bezel paired with two generations of upgrades, the Watch 8 Classic fits the bill nicely.</p><p>Where the Watch 8 display looks naked above the square-ish case, the Watch 8 Classic fills that gap with the zero-to-sixty scale border and the rotating bezel. From your top-down perspective wearing it, the Watch 8 Classic looks stylish and doesn't seem "unnatural."</p><p>To others, however, its flat sides may look bulky, calling attention to the fact that it's a smartwatch.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-display" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the default watch face, display border, and rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2766" height="1556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="m5SWPtuvZkHymD45EFs36a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-quick-button" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sitting on top of an ornamental gold bowl, the right side with three buttons showing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m5SWPtuvZkHymD45EFs36a.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PWL6aEAvifsKmW9YPQfxzZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-side-view" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on the left side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWL6aEAvifsKmW9YPQfxzZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>You may be rightly concerned that the extra steel casing makes the Watch 8 Classic overly heavy. In practice, both my Watch 8 Classic 46mm and Watch 6 Classic 47mm weigh 86g or 3oz. And the newer model is 0.3mm thinner, though you can barely tell the difference in person.</p><p>The bulk <em>does</em> have an impact, because Samsung gave its Watch 8 Classic a smaller 1.34-inch display; there's no 1.5-inch option this time because (presumably) it would be <em>way</em> too heavy. You'll have to accept that visual downgrade, though you get an extra 1,000 nits of brightness, the Quick Button, 64GB of storage, and the other Watch 8 upgrades as consolation.</p><p>It's clear that Samsung made the Classic a more affordable spin-off of the Ultra, without the benefit of an extra day of battery life.

As with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it feels like Samsung has something to prove with the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and its bold yet familiar design shows us that it does listen to consumers… at least somewhat.</p><p>There's certainly a lot to like about the Galaxy Z Flip 7, but there are some big question marks. This includes the move to another chipset despite Samsung's other phones this year using the latest from Qualcomm, as well as Samsung's insistence on not following Motorola's footsteps with regard to exactly how that newly expanded cover screen is handled.</p><p>So, should you buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>? Should you opt for the cheaper Galaxy Z Flip FE or maybe even last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>? Or should you skip Samsung's flip phone altogether and get the Motorola Razr instead?

This is thanks in part to a redesigned hinge, which is thinner and more durable. In fact, Samsung says the Z Flip 7 is 1.1mm thinner than the Galaxy S23 when unfolded.

Stretching across the entire top half of the phone, the external display measures 4.1 inches, making it slightly larger than the cover screen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>.</p><p>This is great because it means content on the cover screen will have much more room to breathe, from selfie previews to app panels, and more.

However, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 still doesn't let you use apps on the cover screen out of the box. As noted by Andrew Myrick in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">hands-on</a>, Samsung still keeps this functionality behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">MultiStar module in Good Lock</a>, meaning users will have to do a bit of extra work to enable this.</p><p>We haven't had a chance to see if there are any improvements to the overall experience, but this already doesn't bode well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Tg6AxfFftiir4PJqXAv866" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-25" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Now Brief hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tg6AxfFftiir4PJqXAv866.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, using apps on the cover screen is very handy, but it's not the be-all end-all of the entire Galaxy Z Flip 7 experience.

The Razr Ultra 2025, for example, doesn't seem to hit awe-inspiring benchmarking numbers compared to other 8 Elite devices, despite the phone performing very well in daily use. The compact Z Flip 7 may not require all that power, and Samsung may be more interested in efficiency than anything else.</p><p>I should note that I don't put much stock in benchmarking and instead rely solely on my experience using devices. The Razr Ultra 2025 can handle just about anything I throw at it, but I can't help but wonder if all that power is why Motorola stuffed a 4,700mAh battery into it. Meanwhile, Samsung seems content with a 4,300mAh battery for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and given the difference in how these two chips are configured, I imagine Samsung is able to etch out more battery life with less.</p><p>Of course, time will tell how the chip will perform, and you'll have to wait for our review for more details.</p><h2 id="verdict-who-should-buy-this-phone-2">Verdict: Who should buy this phone?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in Blue Shadow hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 feels like a huge step in the right direction for Samsung. The improved design and larger cover screen make this a much more competitive flip phone, which should make Motorola nervous. That said, the jury is still out on whether the Exynos 2500 will shine or fall flat when compared to the competition.</p><p>The lower price tag is one of the advantages the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has over the Razr Ultra 2025. You can get it in a lower storage configuration than what Motorola offers, saving you about $200. Even at 512GB, it's still cheaper than Motorola's flagship, although that's with less RAM.</p><p>Overall, I think that almost anyone interested in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 should consider buying one, especially if you're coming from anything older than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. If you do have last year's model, you might wanna hold off upgrading, as the differences aren't as drastic.

July 11, 2005, is regarded by many as the official date when the Android team relocated to the Google campus and became part of the Google team.</p><p>Initially, Android Inc. was developing an operating system for digital cameras, but Google quickly pivoted its focus towards the burgeoning smartphone market, recognizing the immense potential. This acquisition laid the foundation for Google's entry into mobile software, setting the stage for a revolution.</p><p>The first commercially available Android device, the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1), launched in October 2008. At this time, smartphones were still a niche, dominated by BlackBerry. Early Android phones were characterized by physical keyboards, small resistive touchscreens (typically around 3.2 inches), and a focus on basic internet browsing, email, and communication. Consumer needs were relatively simple: a reliable device for calls, texts, some basic web access, and a handful of apps.</p><p>Android's open-source nature quickly attracted developers, leading to a rapid expansion of the app ecosystem. By the early 2010s, Android had begun its meteoric rise, with devices like the Motorola Droid and Samsung Galaxy S series pushing touchscreen-only designs and incrementally larger displays (around 4-5 inches), signing the death certificate for physical keyboards.</p><h2 id="growing-pains-2015-2017-refinement-and-the-rise-of-the-big-screen-2">Growing pains (2015-2017): Refinement and the rise of the big screen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qsuQSb7ouMb2R6KiKUSYFR" name="htc-one-nexus-4-04.jpg" alt="LG Nexus 4 versus HTC One." src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsuQSb7ouMb2R6KiKUSYFR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>By 2015, Android was a <em>mostly</em> mature and dominant platform, having surpassed its competitors in market share. Devices were becoming sleeker, and screen sizes had settled into a comfortable range, typically between 5 and 5.5 inches. The "phablet" category, once a novelty, was starting to influence mainstream design, with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-6p-specs">Nexus 6P</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-review">Galaxy Note</a> series pushing the upper limits. Consumer needs at this time revolved around reliable app performance, improved battery life, and access to a rapidly expanding and increasingly sophisticated app ecosystem for communication, social media, entertainment, and basic productivity.</p><p>Android's strength continued to be its open-source nature, fostering diverse hardware options from numerous manufacturers, which in turn catered to a wide range of budgets and preferences.</p><p>This period saw the solidification of core Android features, the refinement of Material Design for a more cohesive user interface, and significant improvements in camera technology. As users consumed more media, played more graphically intensive games, and engaged with more complex apps, the desire for slightly larger and more vibrant viewing areas began to subtly emerge, pushing screen sizes incrementally upwards and setting the stage for the next wave of innovation.</p><h2 id="the-era-of-edge-to-edge-displays-2018-2020-maximizing-screen-real-estate-2">The era of edge-to-edge displays (2018-2020): Maximizing screen real estate</h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="F6G2N7CAH334QDScAfamr4" name="google-pixel-3-xl-white-4.jpg" alt="Pixel 3 XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F6G2N7CAH334QDScAfamr4.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The years between 2018 and 2020 marked a pivotal shift towards truly expansive, edge-to-edge screens. Manufacturers, driven by consumer demand for more immersive content consumption and enhanced multitasking capabilities, began to minimize bezels aggressively. Innovations like the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-notch-add-screen-space-or-take-it-away">notch</a>," "punch-hole," and later under-display camera designs became common, pushing displays closer to the very edges of the device.</p><p>Screens grew significantly, with 6-inch and even 6.5-inch displays becoming standard, often in taller, narrower aspect ratios that made them more comfortable to hold despite their increased diagonal size.</p><p>Consumer needs evolved beyond basic functionality. Users now expected powerful multi-lens cameras capable of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/computational-photography">computational photography</a>, robust performance for demanding games and applications, and intelligent features powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> (although AI didn't quite mean what it means today).</p><p>Android responded with improvements in camera APIs, enhanced notification management, and deeper integration of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>. The larger, more immersive screens facilitated better split-screen multitasking and provided a superior canvas for media, gaming, and productivity apps, cementing the idea that a bigger display offered a more premium and functional experience.</p><p>This period also saw a greater emphasis on software updates, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-important-are-android-security-patches">security patches</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-privacy-location-data-collection">privacy controls</a>, as smartphones became increasingly central to users' personal and professional lives.</p><h2 id="the-foldable-frontier-2021-present-a-new-form-factor-2">The foldable frontier (2021-Present): A new form factor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PTZZY2kKG6QR9StcMURpS7" name="podcast-addict-android-central-podcast-z-fold-3-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Podcast Addict app playing Android Central podcast on a Galaxy Z Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTZZY2kKG6QR9StcMURpS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most radical change in Android's recent history has been the introduction and maturation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, beginning around 2019 but gaining significant traction and refinement from 2021 onwards.

These devices directly addressed the desire for even larger screen real estate, offering a tablet-sized display when unfolded, while maintaining a pocketable form factor when closed.</p><p>This innovation necessitated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-is-google-getting-serious-about-foldables">significant adaptations within Android itself</a>. Google introduced specific optimizations for large screens, improved app continuity (seamless transitions between folded and unfolded states), and enhanced multitasking features tailored for the expansive inner displays, including better drag-and-drop and multi-window support. Consumer needs now include not just a large screen, but a versatile screen that can adapt to different use cases – from a compact phone to a mini-tablet, and even a laptop-like experience with external accessories.</p><p>Beyond foldables, the trend of large screens continued in traditional slab phones, with premium models routinely sporting displays well over 6.7 inches, often with high refresh rates for smoother scrolling and animations. Privacy and security have also become paramount consumer concerns, leading to more granular permission controls and transparency features within Android.</p><p>The platform continues to evolve, focusing on seamless connectivity, deeper integration with other devices (like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables">wearables</a> and smart home devices), and a more personalized, intelligent user experience, all while pushing the boundaries of hardware innovation with the foldable form factor leading the charge.</p><h2 id="evolving-android-2">Evolving Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iowDZd4ev9eQV6gdinVrbK" name="Android" alt="The Android sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iowDZd4ev9eQV6gdinVrbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4146" height="2332" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since Google's foresightful acquisition of Android Inc. in 2005, the Android ecosystem has undergone a remarkable and ongoing transformation.

Nowadays, things have mostly calmed down, with Amazon, Apple, Google, and Roku leading the charge. Last year, Google shifted its focus, as it introduced the Google TV Streamer 4K, while also retiring the beloved Chromecast line.</p><p>Now, the Google TV Streamer sits atop the mountain in Google's ecosystem, operating as both a smart home hub and an excellent 4K streaming device. It wasn't really something that I expected to be part of the Prime Day festivities, but as it turns out, it's actually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Streamer-Streaming-Entertainment-Porcelain/dp/B0D8WJYSF9/"><strong>$15 off over at Amazon</strong></a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9645927358031349343-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><em><strong>Prime Day 2025 ends tonight!

Google thankfully rectified that with the TV Streamer, as it includes 32GB of storage. And if that isn't enough, you can connect a USB-C hub and a thumb drive to expand it even further.</p><p>There are also a few AI features on board, but they aren't really intrusive and are more novelty than anything else. However, the biggest reason why I love the TV Streamer is that it can basically turn my TV into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">massive smart display</a>.</p><p>Google integrated both Matter and a Thread Border Router into the TV Streamer, ensuring that it would be compatible with just about any smart home ecosystem. Of course, it works best when you use the Google Home app, but if you take the time to set up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-one-app-has-made-my-life-so-much-easier">Home Assistant</a>, you can connect and control all of your smart home devices right from the Google Home app.</p><p>I'm not sure what the future holds for the Google TV Streamer, but it's still performing well enough that it's not something I've even thought about.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-7">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4573639154595610853-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1212356707565852129-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9376992827335726461-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1233177422277781313-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4012941798439036658-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide.</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Even though Prime Day ends at midnight on July 11, some deals will persist on competing sites like Best Buy through the weekend, and one cheap (for Garmin) deal that's currently still available is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-venu-sq-2-gps-smartwatch-40mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-slate-2022/6517040.p?skuId=6517040"><strong>Garmin Venu Sq 2 at $149 ($100 off) at Best Buy</strong></a>.</p><p>We called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Garmin Venu Sq 2</a> the "Goldilocks smartwatch" in our original review because of how it struck a nice balance between smarts and fitness. Since then, Garmin watches have gotten smarter, but also more expensive; I'd love to recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-x1-bizarre-premium-watch-stuck-between-two-worlds">Venu X1</a>, but they're just too dang expensive for an impulse buy to try out the brand.</p><p>That's why I'm recommending the Venu Sq 2 as an affordable gateway into the world of Garmin, to see if you can change your lifestyle and become more fit with a little help, while also benefiting from perks like an 11-day battery life, all-systems GNSS tracking, and a 1.4-inch AMOLED display.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1cd4efa2-456e-408e-8eb3-30a2eb870a1d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Garmin Venu Sq 2 still holds up as an intriguing entry-level option to the brand.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Every time I go on vacation, I haul out my collection of Blink Mini Pan-Tilt cameras and set them up around my house. Each plugs into an outlet with a tiny power brick that fits anywhere, and thanks to the diminutive size, the PTZ camera also fits on any shelf or dresser.</p><p>Since it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/"><strong>just $23</strong></a> for the rest of the day today, July 11, I can grab a few more to ensure I see every nook and cranny of my home while I'm away. That's $23 out the door, no subscription needed or strings to pull, and no garbage or hassles, and no worrying about someone spying on me since I only set them up when I'm away.</p><p>If you've got any other Blink cameras, these will tie right in with them in the Blink app, letting you monitor everything from one handy dashboard. Blink cameras don't require a subscription to work, and you can even pick up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ">Blink Sync Module</a> to configure local storage on an SD card.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ffc90257-7011-43ec-9d72-4f83dc0c7612" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension48="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension25="$23.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="uApUTnYB7nq2dT8wwMyFid" name="blink-mini-pan-tilt-official-product-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uApUTnYB7nq2dT8wwMyFid.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>There's no getting around it. For the price, it's nearly impossible to argue with what Blink offers. Great camera quality, a wider range of movement than Ring, a quick 360-degree pan button to scope out the whole room, and the ability to store footage locally or in the cloud. </p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/blink-ptz-vs-ring-ptz-cameras-which-amazon-brand-should-see-your-home" data-dimension112="ffc90257-7011-43ec-9d72-4f83dc0c7612" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension48="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension25="$23.99"><strong>Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison </strong></a>📷</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for an amazing indoor PTZ camera that has a full 360-degree range of movement, 135-degree tilt range, motion detection, and even a two-way speaker so you can hear what's going on in your house and speak to whoever is there, invited or not!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a camera with 4K resolution, AI-powered object detection, or something more advanced.

It's a horrible security risk if anyone ever gains access to your account, but these cameras are so small and so easy to set up that it's never a hassle to pull them out when I want to use them.</p><p>It's worth noting that this camera is only designed for indoor use. It's not weather-rated at all, so it's definitely going to break if it gets soaked in a rainstorm or baked in the summer heat. Blink sells other cameras that are made for outdoor use. I actually have several of them in my chicken coop, and they do a great job of monitoring the temperature there and in the outdoor rabbit hutch we have.</p><p>Overall, I love Blink and use it for almost all my smart home cameras. It's especially handy that I can keep the footage on local SD cards and not have to pay for cloud storage, although that option is great for people who would rather skip the hassle of dealing with swapping out SD cards or changing video sources.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The fact of the matter is, investing a tiny bit of cash into a stellar charging ecosystem can result in big quality-of-life improvements. If you don't have quality chargers and cables, you're probably not making the most of your flagship tech products.</p><p>Luckily, as Amazon Prime Day winds down, there are still deals that let you build out a fantastic charging portfolio on a budget. I've put together a list of four Anker products that'll help you do just that. Some are priced <strong>as low as under $6</strong>, while the most expensive charger in this roundup is <strong>only $17.99</strong>.</p><p>If you're someone that rolls their eyes at buying new chargers or hates overpaying for unnecessary junk, this is the practical list of Prime Day charging deals you need to jump on — all from popular charging brand Anker.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-8764089166276989524-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Amazon Prime Day is ENDING today!

If the wall adapter plugging into your outlet doesn't support a fast charging speed, nothing else matters. The Anker Nano 3 can deliver 30W fast charging, and considering its small size, that's wildly impressive. Foldable wall prongs mean you can easily throw the Nano 3 in a bag or pocket without issue.</p><p>I've been using Anker Nano chargers for years, and have convinced a few friends and family members to switch to them. After they gave Anker Nano a shot, they didn't want to use any other wall charger. You can pick one up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">only $12 on Prime Day.</a></p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="43b5d6e6-2560-46e2-bd60-2d5bf12c0f07" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker Nano 3:  $19.99" data-dimension48="Anker Nano 3:  $19.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="7HiXjadHykh6wMgScDbGBE" name="Anker 511 Nano 3 USB C GaN Charger 30W.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HiXjadHykh6wMgScDbGBE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="1066" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anker Nano 3: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="43b5d6e6-2560-46e2-bd60-2d5bf12c0f07" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker Nano 3:  $19.99" data-dimension48="Anker Nano 3:  $19.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$19.99</del> <strong>$12.29 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Anker Nano 3 should be the default USB-C wall adapter.

They're durable and support 60W fast charging speeds — enough to make the most of the Anker Nano 3 charger and future upgrades.</p><p>You can get two, three-foot-long USB-C to USB-C cables for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Charge-Samsung-MacBook/dp/B0BPC6TTNX/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">under $6 on Prime Day.</a> That's less than $3 per cable, which is honestly insane.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ba11e642-2ea4-4e6e-9069-e72bf0a0a28c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (2PK):  $7.99" data-dimension48="Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (2PK):  $7.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Charge-Samsung-MacBook/dp/B0BPC6TTNX/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="eTpve6bvRjsiRc5PfPym5g" name="Anker-USBC-Cable-2pk" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eTpve6bvRjsiRc5PfPym5g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (2PK): </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Charge-Samsung-MacBook/dp/B0BPC6TTNX/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="ba11e642-2ea4-4e6e-9069-e72bf0a0a28c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (2PK):  $7.99" data-dimension48="Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (2PK):  $7.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$7.99</del> <strong>$5.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>After double-checking the price, I can confirm it's real: you can get TWO braided USB-C cables supporting 60W charging for only $6.

This isn't some back alley deal, it's just the best smartphone deal you'll find today since it's so darn cheap. And yeah, I have four of them. Don't judge me.</p><p>The Nuu N20 is a surprisingly capable phone that'll do all the basics and then some. It's a great choice for your kid's first phone, a vacation phone (so you don't have to worry about something more expensive getting stolen), or even just as a backup device to keep in a drawer.</p><p>This one ramped up in price in May because of the lovely tariff situation in the U.S. but it's back down to pre-tariff pricing until the end of the day today, Friday, July 11. That's the last day of Prime Day, if you hadn't heard!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="cb6b0bc0-78b0-459c-9174-4a1c21d75fa9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Coral" data-dimension48="Coral" data-dimension25="$109" href="https://www.amazon.com/NUU-T-Mobile-Teenagers-Octa-Core-Unlocked/dp/B0DLG4WKKG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1432px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:104.75%;"><img id="ua5jKrVxHZ77XWbeQF5ugJ" name="nuun-20-product-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ua5jKrVxHZ77XWbeQF5ugJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1432" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Also check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLG5C7SD/" data-dimension112="cb6b0bc0-78b0-459c-9174-4a1c21d75fa9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Coral" data-dimension48="Coral" data-dimension25="$109"><strong>Coral</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLGHZ3YN/"><strong>Purple</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLGKWNMR/"><strong>Green</strong></a> colorways for the same price!</p><p>The Nuu N20 is a no-frills Android 14-powered phone that can download all your favorite apps from the Google Play Store and works perfectly with U.S. 4G networks like T-Mobile. Grab one for your kids, your next vacation, or just as a backup phone in case yours breaks.</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a simple Android phone that can do all the basics — phone calls, messaging, downloading apps, taking pictures and video — but don't need anything high-powered or expensive. This one doesn't look or feel cheap, despite what you might assume!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you have no interest in a cheap backup phone.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/NUU-T-Mobile-Teenagers-Octa-Core-Unlocked/dp/B0DLG4WKKG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="cb6b0bc0-78b0-459c-9174-4a1c21d75fa9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Coral" data-dimension48="Coral" data-dimension25="$109">View Deal</a></p></div><p>As you might imagine, the Nuu N20 isn't going to win any awards for best display, camera, or processing speed. But what it will win is the best Prime Day value award, because it gives you a full-fledged Android 14-powered experience without all the fluff that comes with other devices.</p><p>Nuu is based in Miami, Florida, and does an excellent job crafting a stock-like Android experience without the bloat or preinstalled nonsense that some other budget brands fill their phones with.</p><p>This one's got 6GB of RAM, which is 50% more than any Motorola phone at this price range, and the 90Hz display feels smoother than even the $1,000 iPhones. No, I'm dead serious there. The non-Pro iPhones use a paltry 60Hz screen, which feels just plain awful in 2025. Meanwhile, this $109 phone eclipses half of Apple's recent lineup in this one area. It's pretty wild.</p><p>Nuu also advertises that the N20 works perfectly with any parental control app, so you can keep your kids safe online. I personally use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bark.us/">Bark parental controls</a> for my son and love how it can catch even bad images that might appear on your child's phone, thanks to the "wonders" of the internet. Whatever you do with it, though, make sure you buy it before midnight tonight, otherwise this deal is gone.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a phenomenal system with lots of upgrades over the original model, but some people are unhappy with the LCD screen on the system. While Nintendo doesn't sell an OLED-equipped model yet, you can get an OLED on the go when using a pair of smart glasses, but you'll need this clever battery pack to get the job done.</p><p>Thankfully, the Viture Pro Mobile Dock is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW"><strong>on sale for $98.10</strong></a> on the last day of Prime Day, which ends Friday, July 11. This 10,000mAh battery pack has a set of special USB-C ports that trick the Switch 2 into thinking it's docked to a TV, unlocking the full power of the system and making it possible to play it on a pair of OLED-equipped smart glasses. Not only that, but this supports <em>two</em> smart glasses at a time, so you and someone else can play at the same time with a giant virtual OLED.</p><p>See, with most handheld systems, you can just plug smart glasses into the USB-C port and your system thinks it's docked, but not the Switch 2. Nintendo locked down the USB-C port on this system just as with the original Switch, but Viture cleverly designed the Mobile Dock to work with Nintendo's security, making this the <em>only </em>way to play on a Switch 2 with smart glasses.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vitures-new-luma-glasses-are-incredible-and-this-viture-prime-day-sale-is-impossible-to-resist"><strong>Viture's new Luma glasses are incredible, and this Viture Prime Day sale is impossible to resist</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="03daf6d7-3403-4322-88d2-8268e68c337a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central review" data-dimension48="Android Central review" data-dimension25="$98.10" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HWLY3T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1425px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tUS3fEEJW9kcgoeZyj8NwR" name="viture-pro-mobile-dock-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tUS3fEEJW9kcgoeZyj8NwR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1425" height="1425" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Be sure to clip the </em><em><strong>10% off coupon</strong></em><em> on Amazon's page before checking out to get the full discount.</em></p><p>Plug the Viture Pro Mobile Dock into your Switch 2 and enjoy docked performance and quality on the go.

Trying out these glasses, and their embedded speakers, showed me how freeing it is to listen to music on-the-go without clogging up your ears. Enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds" target="_blank">the best open-earbuds</a>, designed to provide a personal listening experience without the hassle.</p><p>Why might you want a pair of open earbuds? This style of audio gear might make sense if you're someone that has a hard time finding ear tips and buds that fit perfectly. Since the Bose Ultra Open earbuds sit outside your ear canal, this isn't a problem at all. They gently rest outside your ear canal while subtly clipping onto your earlobe for comfort and security.</p><p>The open design means you can also let ambient noise in, which can be desirable in a few kinds of situations. Maybe you're a runner or cyclist who needs to hear the world around you for a safe workout. Or, perhaps you work at a jobsite or office where it's necessary to hear what's going on nearby.</p><p>There are a few tradeoffs — without passive isolation, bass reproduction won't be at its best and you might need to crank the volume up in noisy environments. But for the right person, these are small sacrifices that become worthwhile to get the perfect fit. At the right price — under $200 at Best Buy for a limited time — the Bose Ultra Open earbuds are an excellent buy.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-32">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1247058908279972596-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE July 8-11: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1710879167675793923-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2723093340651576047-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1324054839394922680-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1144969634142208516-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Rumors suggest we might see one pretty soon.</p><p>A render of a fancy-looking Motorola Razr was posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-motorola-razr-swarovski-edition-is-launching-soon-first-look/">YTECHB</a> today (July 11), suggesting an incoming collaboration edition (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_is_working_on_a_blingedup_razr-news-68590.php">GSMArena</a>). The publication claims Motorola is preparing to bring a fancy new "crystal-studded" Razr 2025 foldable edition. From the rendering, the device looks mostly the same, save for the small crystals (kind of like diamonds) popped into its form factor.</p><p>On the cover display, there are supposedly three crystals implanted near the hinge, just above the screen. The back of the device is where the design is reportedly going to shine the most. It seems Motorola will implant crystal studs into a (seemingly) soft fabric material, which looks almost like a fancified purse.</p><p>Prominent X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1943538675964342466">Evan Blass</a> got in on things, stating this phone is looking at a debut on August 5; however, we might know who it's with. The tipster's post and the publication both claim Motorola is looking at Swarovski, a jewelry company, to bedazzle its foldable.</p><p>Moreover, it seems this collaboration edition will only concern the base Razr 2025 foldable. The rendering doubles down on this, furthered by the thicker border between the cover display and the hinge. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra</a> offers a slightly larger display (4-inch), so the border is much thinner on it.</p><h2 id="motorola-and-its-collabs-special-editions-2">Motorola and its collabs/special editions</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:591px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.49%;"><img id="7dpZ2q5aERYqm45FBGiMs8" name="motorola-razr-2025-swarovski-render-leak" alt="A leaked render of the Motorola Razr 2025 with a light blue color scheme for its rumored Swarovski jewelry collaboration." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7dpZ2q5aERYqm45FBGiMs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="591" height="588" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YTECHB)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The name Swarovski might sound familiar, and that's because Motorola collaborated with them once before (or you like their jewelry). Earlier this year, when the Razr 2025 series debuted, Motorola launched its first-ever open-earbuds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">the Buds Loop</a>. These buds are offered with 12mm drivers for rich sound, and they come in the following colors: Pantone-curated Trekking Green and a dazzling Pantone-curated French Oak.</p><p>However, there was a third option: a crystal-encrusted version, thanks to Swarovski. These buds are lighter in color, and the crystals are present along the band that connects the two halves of the device for each ear. It seems Motorola was pleased with the first round, so it's looking into the collaboration again for its foldable phone.</p><p>Motorola has always been one for unique collaborations and special editions. Back in February, the company launched a special edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-paris-pink-limited-edition-launch">Razr Plus 2024 with Paris Hilton</a>. The device was offered in a new Paris Pink with a vegan leather finish, as well as two wrist straps in Pink Sparkle and Pink Vegan Leather. Consumers could also grab a vegan leather case that continues the Paris Pink trend with her signature and iconic phrase, "That's Hot."</p><p>On a more subtle note, the Razr Plus 2024 also received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-2024-razr-plus-pantone-rich-mocha-shade">a Mocha Mousse color</a> from Pantone late last year.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Of course, immediately facing a lot of people is the main Android OS: Android 16. While Google has fast-tracked Android 16, moving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">into the "Trunk Stable" process</a> for quicker development cycles, Samat says the software's goal remains letting users "fit the ethos of what’s on your home screen with the rest of your phone."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is a noteworthy upgrade; however, Samat states the goal was to create an OS that felt “modern and delightful” without disrupting your muscle memory.</p><p>While Samat feels confident in his work at Google with Android, stating, “I think you see the future first on Android," there's more to do. Specifically, Samat is concerned about bridging the gap between iOS and Android for users who <em>want </em>to switch. Samat says, "...this should be simple. It's 2025." Currently, there's an issue when switching platforms, and risks.</p><p>Samat is interested in utilizing in using more modern "industry standards to move data between the two, and that is a lot of what we’re advocating for and pushing for."</p><p>Google is leaning into its large design changes in Android 16 (and likely the future) when it comes to statements like seeing the "future first" on the software. Android 16 adds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>, which largely changes animations, colors, and more.</p><h2 id="gemini-takes-center-stage-2">Gemini takes center stage</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum" name="Gemini-Era-Google.jpg" alt="The Gemini Era graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthering Android's future are plans to merge "ChromeOS and Android into a single platform." Samat teased that there's a strong curiosity behind understanding how users (such as those on iOS) are using their phones with their laptops.</p><p>TechRadar and Samat's discussions boiled down into another key Android area: Gemini. Per Samat, "...Gemini integrated in a phone really provides a much more helpful experience." The AI is a part of Google's plans for Android, and its assistance will likely only continue to progress and evolve. In their interview, Samat showed off Gemini's ability to summarize a YouTube video, equipped with timestamps for fact-checking.</p><p>The publication called it a "powerful demonstration," partly due to Apple's lack of such capabilities with its Intelligence/Siri software.</p><p>Samat praises Google's AI once more, highlighting its ease of use for consumers. He says, "Gemini is the best assistant out there. Hold down the side key on any flagship Android phone, it’s gonna bring up Gemini, right to the context of where you’re at. Those two capabilities are built by Google."</p><p>TechRadar and Sameer Samat continued their interview, discussing the idea of "too much AI" and what's empowering Android XR.

While it brought some substantial design changes, Google also packed in a host of new features for users. Among them, you'll find Live Updates, which are real-time updates concerning navigation and even food orders. Android 16 also streamlined notifications, making it easier for alerts belonging to the same app to be displayed without overwhelming (or cluttering) your device.</p><p>Additionally, the OS added Advanced Protection software, a feature that better protects a user's phones from unsafe websites and "most sophisticated attacks."</p><p>Google has also been working with other OEMs like Samsung and OnePlus to help flesh out their features for Android 16 for a more cohesive OS. The future of Android continues as the company recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-canary-release-channel-devs-rigorous-testing-pixels">Android Canary Release Channel</a> for developers.

There's also a stigma attached, and I won't lie to ya: many audio aficionados can be a little snooty when it comes to gear. I'm not one of them.</p><p>To me, audiophile means you love music and want it to sound great, and if you like the way things sound with the gear you love, you're one of us.

You can find headphones that offer a better sound, but you're going to pay a lot of money for a relatively small gain in quality. In fact, these rank as one of my favorites, along with "budget" picks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E/ref=sr_1_9?th=1" target="_blank">from Sony</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-XS-Headphones-Audiophiles-Studio-Black/dp/B09PH1N67T/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank">Hifiman</a>. They sound a lot better than their price tag would indicate.</p><p>The perfect pair of headphones doesn't exist, but if it did, they would inflect nothing of their own into your music; reproducing it exactly as it comes from the source. With a THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) of less than 0.1% these come really close. Close enough that you probably wouldn't notice it at all.</p><p>Open-back headphones offer a unique experience, but come with drawbacks. If you are the type who carries around a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">portable headphone amp</a> for your phone, don't use these while out and about unless you want everyone to "enjoy" whatever you're listening to. Outside of that, open-back cans offer a wonderful sound stage and almost sound like you're listening at a concert instead of a chair.</p><p>Big over-ear headphones with wires aren't for everyone, and I get it. You should use whatever you love when you want to enjoy your music. If you really like what you hear from a good set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">wireless earbuds</a>, save your $100 and put it towards the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds Pro</a> model.</p><p>If you want to try something different, know you want something better, or are just curious, you'll be hard pressed to find a cheaper way to get started down the wonderfully frustrating and expensive path of the audiophile.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-47">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When you think of a protective phone case, you probably think of something that covers the entirety of the phone to ensure maximum protection. The Arc Pulse case series says "you don't need all that nonsense," but usually doesn't give you a price break for its lack of materials. Thankfully, Prime Day changes that with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Arc-Pulse-Compatible-Minimalist-Protective/dp/B0FBMDPGW7/"><strong>rare 20% discount</strong></a> on what are otherwise pretty expensive phone cases.</p><p>Arc Pulse works by covering the area of your phone that most commonly come in contact with the ground when it's dropped. That's the top and bottom edges, as well as all four corners. It's even got protective lips around the front edge of the display, but the rest of the phone is totally exposed for the whole world to see.</p><p>Arc Pulse cases are often limited-run items. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-arc-pulse-case-impressions">Pixel 9 Arc Pulse case</a> can no longer be found on Amazon, even though the manufacturer sells them in limited quantities on its website. That makes a discount on the cases a special event, but it's only good <strong>until the end of the day</strong> Friday, July 11.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="33716586-805b-4f61-ae48-a1fbbb6df27e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central review" data-dimension48="Android Central review" data-dimension25="$71.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Arc-Pulse-Compatible-Minimalist-Protective/dp/B0FBMDPGW7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Tzpz7tBJRSCDcDwSuVgk3V" name="arc-pulse-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tzpz7tBJRSCDcDwSuVgk3V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>"I don't often drop test phones in cases because so many cases are very similar, but Arc Pulse is a different beast entirely. For the test, I dropped the phone on three different flooring types: a wood floor, an area rug placed on concrete, and bare concrete. I dropped it at pocket height, roughly 3ft, and at head height, roughly 6ft, to simulate the two most common ways someone might drop their phone. To my surprise, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL was spotless after all these drops. No scratches, cracks, or any other damage was found, and the case's unique design is surprisingly effective." — Nick Sutrich for Android Central</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-arc-pulse-case-impressions" data-dimension112="33716586-805b-4f61-ae48-a1fbbb6df27e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central review" data-dimension48="Android Central review" data-dimension25="$71.99"><strong>Android Central review</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐</a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you love the way your phone looks and hate covering it up, but are afraid to drop something that costs $1,300 outright.

I prefer to use my phones without a case, but not everyone is as crazy as me. This, at least, gives you protection on the most important parts without ruining the look and feel of a caseless phone.</p><p>The case is made entirely of metal, so you know it's super sturdy, and has a rubberized interior shock layer that keeps the metal from scratching or impacting your precious glass phone in the event of a drop.</p><p>When I got the first Arc Pulse case for the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL earlier this year, I made a quick video showing the drop test performance on carpet, wood, and concrete from two different heights. Check out that video below to see how it would protect your Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lMcYXG5BWCM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Even with this video evidence, I totally understand being nervous about buying an ultra-minimalist case like this. <em>In that case</em>, I recommend grabbing the Pitaka Aramid Fiber case for Galaxy S25 Ultra, also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/pitaka-Compatible-MagSafe-Samsung-Ultra-Slim/dp/B0DQ1V2J7W"><strong>on sale for 20% off</strong></a> for the rest of the day today.</p><p>An Aramid Fiber case is designed to offer additional grip for these super slippery glass-and-metal sandwich phones, as well as scratch protection in the event of a drop. Not that they are generally <em>not</em> great for drops on concrete or similar situations, while the all-metal and rubber-lined Arc Pulse case above will almost certainly do a better job, ironically.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Over the years, I've slowly stopped wearing smart watches during the day and typically only wear them for working out, hiking, or other outdoor activities. Turns out, the Instinct 2X Solar was <em>made</em> for this kind of use and beyond, as its <strong>40-day battery life</strong> was a staggering improvement over my previous favorite Wear OS watches.</p><p>The Instinct 2X Solar has a dope solar panel on top, which can not only measure the UV intensity (letting you know when to put more sun coverage on), but it also charges the super bright flashlight built into the side. If that's not enough, its ability to understand which muscles you're working out while on the go feels like pure magic, and it will help you better log and train for specific fitness improvement.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ff418896-5e1d-4275-a82a-0a7040186f29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension48="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability-Multi-Band/dp/B0BW34M77J/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="v7uqQbSmikoXGmg4i53mS" name="Garmin Instinct 2x Solar" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v7uqQbSmikoXGmg4i53mS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability-Multi-Band/dp/B0BW34M77J/" data-dimension112="ff418896-5e1d-4275-a82a-0a7040186f29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension48="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$449.99</del><strong> $299.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>Price check 💵: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-smartwatch-50-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-gray-2023/6541150.p?skuId=6541150"><strong>$299 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>"I loved the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar when I reviewed it last year, but what a difference a year makes!

I sprained my ankle last week so I've been doing more upper-body stuff this week to give me ankle a rest (plus a lot less cardio since, you know, it hurts to use the ankle). All I did was set my Garmin Instinct 2X Solar to a HIIT workout and click the "go" button. It magically figured out what I was working out, all without me needing to tell it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:110.01%;"><img id="HmBDb8wjcLctzVr2uPtKoE" name="garmin-instinct-2x-solar-hiit-workout" alt="A HIIT workout with muscle usage as measured by a Garmin Instinct 2X Solar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmBDb8wjcLctzVr2uPtKoE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="2253" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Amazfit Balance 2 I've been using can do something similar, but it usually only assigns muscle usage based on specific workout types. For instance, I used it to log "strength training" and it was able to figure out that I was doing deadlifts, so it logged my legs as being heavily used. But selecting a HIIT workout on the Amazfit Balance 2 will only give me heart rate data, not muscle usage.</p><p>While this muscle data might seem superfluous at first, it's actually incredibly helpful for specific training. That way, you know exactly which muscles were used by each type of workout, even if you go to a CrossFit or WOD type of gym with a lot of variety. If I were in the market for another smartwatch right now, this is the deal I'd be buying today. There's absolutely no question.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Thinborne cases are sleek, svelte, and offer excellent protection thanks to the use of Aramid Fiber. Plus, since Samsung didn't include the magnetic element of Qi2.1, Thinborne picks up the slack by integrating MagSafe compatibility. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FDV764HR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="05f37a28-2b47-461e-a7b9-41a03437ee1c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Thinborne Aramid Fiber Galaxy Z Fold 7 Case:  $89.98" data-dimension48="Thinborne Aramid Fiber Galaxy Z Fold 7 Case:  $89.98" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're not really a fan of cases, or just prefer them to be ultra-thin while still offering excellent protection. Or you want a thin case that is actually compatible with MagSafe.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a phone case that protects your Fold 7 or Flip 7 from every angle, regardless of how hefty it is.</p><p>Something else to take into consideration when trying to find a case for the Fold 7 or Flip 7 is that neither offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-qi2-wireless-charging-support">full Qi2.1 support</a>. Instead, both of these phones meet the bare minimum requirements for Qi2.1 certification, but lack the internal hardware magnets. This is partially why Samsung is releasing a few of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-cases">its own</a> cases with the necessary magnetic ring built in.</p><p>I can only assume that Samsung didn't add magnets because that would potentially mean not being able to make these phones as thin as they are. And while that's definitely disappointing, having something like a Thinborne case more than makes up for it.</p><p>Nevertheless, I'm grateful that I don't have to deal with trying to get a dbrand skin aligned properly before trying to do the same with an adhesive MagSafe adapter. I can't tell you how many times I've thought that everything was lined up, only to find that the phone wouldn't charge when mounted on a MagSafe charger. Or even more annoying is trying to take off my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PopSockets-Compatible-Wireless-Charging-Wars-Long/dp/B0CZS4S32H/">MagSafe PopSocket</a>, only to pull the adapter off with it.</p><p>Thinborne solves all of those problems, while actually offering quite a bit more protection than a phone skin will. And like I mentioned above, both the Fold 7 and Flip 7 versions are on sale for 30% when using either code <strong>5ZOUHBLK</strong> or <strong>5ECY7ANJ </strong>at checkout.<strong> </strong></p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-57">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4671599217540639638-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1426801779885312155-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9718275238151007431-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1026980263717059872-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-6189443266861686266-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The thin and lightweight Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge just hit store shelves on May 30th, and yet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVL6DB5/"><strong>you can already score a record-smashing 29% discount on the phone</strong></a> if you buy it before Prime Day ends. </p><p>Deals on the S25 Edge have been few and far between since the phone was first announced, so I really didn&apos;t expect Amazon to go full throttle with the discounts right away. $100 off or something, sure, but a $315 discount?

Despite the lightweight frame, the S25 Edge is still packed with a ton of flagship-level specs, such as the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 12GB of RAM, and a massive 200MP camera. The device also boasts a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a durable Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 construction, plus you get seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. </p><p>With its 3,900mAh battery, it&apos;s true that the S25 Edge may not last as long as other modern flagships, but it&apos;s a small price to pay if, like me, you want the sleekest Android phone on the market today. My only major concern with the Edge was its price, but thanks to this last-minute Prime Day deal, that&apos;s much less of a problem. </p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-x2014-quick-links-7">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

According to the post, the chip has received the codename "Aspen," it's known as "SW6100" internally for Qualcomm, and it's "testing phase." At the moment, the publication claims the chip is preparing a noticeable CPU upgrade, courtesy of a 1+4 core setup.</p><p>This core setup reportedly features one Arm Cortex-A78 alongside four Arm Cortex-A55 cores. Despite these cores being roughly a year old, speculation suggests this CPU upgrade could benefit the chip's "efficiency and performance."</p><p>Other alleged specs include the use of a TSMC node and a RAM controller upgrade. The chip will reportedly support LPDDR5X for a slight "battery life boost." There have also been whispers about a new coprocessor; however, the publication states concrete information about that hardware is still in the dark.</p><p>Rumors add that this Qualcomm chip for future Wear OS devices could debut sometime in 2026.</p><h2 id="take-a-step-back-into-2024-2">Take a step back into 2024</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5193px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MRmBQzMmweVwxvaQX2ZfQb" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-w5+-embedded-in-watch.jpg" alt="Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ on device up-close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MRmBQzMmweVwxvaQX2ZfQb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5193" height="2921" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's where things get interesting. Android Central's Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">sat down with Qualcomm's VP & GM of Wearables</a>, Dino Bekis, about the future of the company's Wear OS chips after previous disappointments. While Bekis stated the "next" chip would be more "feature-focused" for Wear OS devices, with AI and PC-like additions, it might need a little more time in the oven. Bekis mentions that Qualcomm was still working with Google to figure out its RISC-V cores.</p><p>Moreover, the company has thought about using its Oryon cores in this wearable chip (the same ones that power its flagship phone SoC), but there's no telling if this recently rumored chip is <em>that </em>chip.</p><p>These were all things talked about in 2024, and it seems we're still floating around the same bits of information. As Android Authority also speculates, this chip could be called the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 or, perhaps, something else, when it debuts.</p><p>The last chips to come from Qualcomm for wearables were the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 and W5 Plus Gen 1</a>. While they generally fixed some of the issues plaguing the Wear OS market, the chips provided a ~50% battery life boost based on a 4nm process. Considering the recent rumors, perhaps we'll see this improve to a 3nm process for the next iteration.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 has become my favorite tablet of the year, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/tablets/android-tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3/len103g0002"><strong>is now $120 off</strong></a> in a Lenovo Doorbuster deal.</p><p>When it was announced, I was already excited, seeing as it packs the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 behind a gorgeous 8.8-inch screen. It was also expected to be pretty affordable with a $499 launch price. However, the U.S. tariff situation resulted in the price being increased to $549 just days after it was released.</p><p>Since then, we've seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo/3-reasons-why-this-is-the-android-tablet-you-should-buy">Legion Tab Gen 3</a> drop as low as $449, but now, you can get it for even less.

Unlike many other premium tablets out there, Lenovo opted against using an OLED panel. This is great news for those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">who suffer from PWM</a>, such as my colleague Nick Sutrich.</p><p>While I could continue gushing about how great this tablet is, there are a couple of sticking points. The first of which is that you're stuck with one RAM and storage configuration (12GB/256GB), and there's no microSD card slot. Lenovo remedied this with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo/even-lenovo-knows-that-you-want-to-use-your-tablet-as-a-gaming-handheld">latest Y700 tablet</a>, but that has yet to see a release here in the States.</p><p>Another surprising omission is that the Legion Tab Gen 3 lacks a fingerprint scanner. When the tablet was announced, I just assumed it would be embedded in the power button. That's not the case, so you're left relying on the traditional unlock methods, and while there's Face Unlock, it's the rather basic version that adorned older and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/no-joke-this-is-the-cheap-android-phone-that-i-would-buy-right-now">cheaper phones</a>.</p><p>Despite those pitfalls, the Legion Tab Gen 3 is still my favorite tablet of the year, to this point. It's so good that I ended up picking up a second one that will be used for my various tinkering projects without needing to worry about something happening to the one I already have.

And, this seemed to be the case for the last five years.</p><p>"So, we're making updates to better match how people discover trending content today by shifting away from one all-encompassing Trending list towards category-specific charts that we’ll continue to invest in over time," the YouTube team stated in the aforementioned post.</p><p>So, technically, instead of finding all types of content in a single Trending page, YouTube is diversifying through a new Charts feature.

You also get 12GB of RAM straight out of the box, and like other Pixel phones, seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed.</p><p>As for the wireless, Mint Mobile&apos;s Unlimited plan will give you unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile&apos;s groundbreaking 5G network, plus you get a free mobile hotspot and free calling to Mexico, Canada, and the UK. There&apos;s a reason we listed it as one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited plans</a> for Android users. This deal locks you in to two years of coverage at a 50% discount, after which you&apos;re free to keep the phone and switch carriers at your discretion. </p><p>Some folks may not wish to tie themselves down to one carrier for two years, but imagine getting a great new phone AND unlimited wireless for only $30 per month until 2027. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/amazon-prime-day-google-pixel-deals-2025">Prime Day&apos;s Pixel sale</a> is great and all, but if you can make this Mint Mobile deal work for you, it&apos;d be a mistake not to consider it. </p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-x2014-quick-links-12">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide.</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
