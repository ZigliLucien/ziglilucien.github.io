That's exactly what I mean. Google was able to pull off a major OS update in a way that seems familiar to everyone, which can't be easy when adding the things the platform is missing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FgLGN6ffKxpzHiEBeJY7qF" name="android-16-qpr-beta-1-home-screen-pixel-9-pro-fold-2" alt="Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 home screen on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgLGN6ffKxpzHiEBeJY7qF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What you might call a boring iterative update and something you would expect from Apple is anything but. Under the hood are some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-intrusion-detection-advanced-protection-code">big changes and improvements</a> that we deserve, including changes to the official Google Play Store and other Google apps. It's like Google took a long, hard look at what was wrong and decided to start fixing it.</p><p>Yet on the user-facing side, you might not even know you're using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-i-o-2025-prepares-sessions-list-android-xr-ai">an entirely new platform</a> aside from the fresh coat of paint introduced as part of Material 3 Expressive (which will come via a SPR1 update later this year). The less obvious changes are there if you know what you're looking for, but installing the latest beta on a phone that was running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> moments before isn't the jarring slew of changes that we've seen in the past.</p><p>Those were changes you and I may have liked, but they may have seemed strange and discomforting to the average consumer; you know, the people buying billions of phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA" name="Android-16-Pixel9PF" alt="The logo for Android 16 on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most importantly, I'm not seeing sharpened pitchforks from upset app developers like I have in the past. Maybe the company spent more time listening and addressing issues before they became serious, or it found a way to change without causing a ruckus in the developer community. Since apps are what drives any software platform in 2025, that's a smart move.</p><p>I'll be honest, I didn't expect this. Not that I was thinking it would be another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-ui-design-holo-material-design-material-you">early-2000s sci-fi look</a> and feel or anything, but I did not assume an Android update would be this subtle, again, if you discount the cosmetic changes coming with the QPR1 update.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xbrBEuPwP6RdkBtdUXNfmF" name="android-16-qpr-beta-1-multi-tasking-menu-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="New multi-tasking context menu in Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbrBEuPwP6RdkBtdUXNfmF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I always say to hold off from installing any beta update to the phone you use every day, especially when it comes to the developer previews, and I'm not saying otherwise here. However, if you do <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">install the beta</a>, I'm betting you'll notice the same thing. It's not <em>really</em> the same as it ever was, but it kind of feels like it, even if it looks a little different. That's a good thing.</p><p>You can install the latest Android 16 QPR1 beta on some phones, most notably Pixel smartphones like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>. Even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-might-drop-the-one-ui-8-beta-way-earlier-than-we-think">Samsung is rumored to be ready early this time</a>. When it does get to you, I think you're going to like it; you're for sure going to be familiar with it. That's the best thing of all.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One of the most unique features is Playlist Studio, which lets you ask Moto AI to create a music playlist based on any criteria you want.</p><p>Whether you're looking for upbeat music to take the edge off a stressful day or you're trying to relax to some calming zen music, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> is able to assemble quick playlists that'll last roughly 30 minutes per session. It's all accessible in the Moto AI app, and here's how to use it.</p><h2 id="how-to-create-an-ai-generated-playlist-on-a-motorola-phone-2">How to create an AI-generated playlist on a Motorola phone</h2><p>1. Download the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mp3"><strong>Amazon Music app</strong></a><strong> </strong>from the Google Play Store and sign in with your Amazon account.</p><p>2. Open the <strong>Moto AI app </strong>from the app drawer of your Motorola phone.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Playlist Studio</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>Amazon Music</strong> from the list of available services and sign in using your Amazon account.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.13%;"><img id="oKTJxm53662qXnhwmLYBaL" name="moto-ai-playlist-studio-how-to-01" alt="Moto AI's Playlist Studio feature running on a Motorola Razr Plus (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oKTJxm53662qXnhwmLYBaL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now that Amazon Music and Playlist Studio are both set up, it's easy to ask Moto AI to make you a playlist. Follow these steps each time you want to make a playlist:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Moto AI app </strong>from the app drawer of your Motorola phone.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Playlist Studio</strong>.</p><p>3. <strong>Type or say</strong> what sort of music you want to listen to. Motorola's favorite marketing prompt is "Y2K pizza party jams," but you can be more or less specific, if you'd like.</p><p>4. Once the playlist is generated, tap the <strong>Open with Amazon Music button</strong> in the bottom right corner.</p><p>5. Enjoy your tunes!</p><p>Moto AI launched on the latest Motorola phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>, but it still works perfectly well on some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a>. Since the cloud powers Moto AI's Playlist Studio and uses streaming music services to deliver tunes, you need to be connected to the internet for it to work.</p><p>Since Playlist Studio is still new, its scope is a bit limited. For the time being, it can only use the Amazon Music app and can only make playlists of 10 songs at a time, but Motorola will likely expand this functionality in future updates. We hope that Motorola will also expand the feature to support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">best music streaming services</a>.</p><p>You can use <em>any</em> prompt to create a playlist in Playlist Studio, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-ai-generated-radio-stations-youtube-music">creating AI-generated radio stations in YouTube Music</a>, so be as creative as you want or just ask Moto AI to suggest some music based on your tastes. The sky's the limit, so long as it's available in Amazon's library!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="45e93fd5-d681-4d54-bd2f-5e8e314952f6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdWkC6F5EinhiN99YnWz7D.jpg' alt="Razr 2025 render in Spring Bud"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Motorola Razr 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Affordable flip phone</strong></em></p><p>Upgrade to one of the coolest flip phones ever made without breaking the bank!

For starters, the flagship boasts an eye-friendly 6.8-inch OLED display that&apos;s simply a joy to look at, while the IP69 water/resistance rating means that the phone is tough enough to stick in a dishwasher (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl5QVUadfbs"><strong>yes, we actually did this</strong></a>). </p><p>Things get even more impressive under the hood, as the OnePlus 13 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, widely considered to be the best chip used in Android phones today. You also get exceptional battery life and Oxygen OS 15 with six years of software updates guaranteed.</p><p>Sure, $749.99 is still a lot to spend on a smartphone, and if you want all of the latest AI-boosted software features with offline connectivity then you might be better off investing in a Samsung or Pixel phone. But if you simply want a powerful device with great performance, long-lasting battery life, and a durable construction that you can count on, then the OnePlus 13 is a dream come true.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's either the uber-expensive Galaxy S25 Ultra or more affordable options from the likes of Motorola. Luckily, Motorola does a stellar job of making its smartphones feel far more premium than their price tags. The leather-backed Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is no exception.</p><p>Boasting the powerful Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chipset, the 2024 iteration of Motorola's stylus-bearing lineup has some seriously impressive specs for the price. For starters, the device comes with a 6.7-inch pOLED panel with super-slim bezels and a snappy 120Hz refresh rate, so the visual experience is a delight.</p><p>Performance-wise, you'll find no complaints either.

Qualcomm and MediaTek effectively have a duopoly in this regard, and although Samsung is still chugging along with its Exynos designs, it isn't anywhere close to what the other two chip vendors manage to deliver on a consistent basis.</p><p>Google is doing a decent job with its Tensor portfolio, but these products are customized to focus on AI and not necessarily deliver the best power. That isn't the case with the Xring O1; Xiaomi is clearly positioning it as a rival to the best that Qualcomm and MediaTek have to offer; the chipset built on a second-gen TSMC 3nm node, and comes with a 10-core CPU and 16-core Arm Immortalis-G925 GPU.</p><p>Xiaomi is using Arm's v9.2 cores, and the 10-core design gives it a distinct edge over its rivals, which have stuck to an octa-core configuration for a while now. The Xring O1 uses two Cortex X925 cores clocked at 3.9GHz, a quartet of Cortex A725 cores at 3.4GHz, two additional A725 cores at 1.9GHz, and two Cortex A520 cores at 1.8GHz. The manufacturer is leveraging Arm's CoreLink Interconnect system to make the most of the tri-core architecture.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="syi2xrU98AhSEgGr9pW3Hb" name="Xiaomi Xring 01" alt="Xiaomi Xring O1 render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/syi2xrU98AhSEgGr9pW3Hb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, thanks to 16 shader cores in the Immortalis-G925, Xiaomi is able to claim a definite win over MediaTek — which uses 12 cores in its Dimensity 9400. That's not all; it gets Xiaomi's own ISP (now in its fourth generation), and a 6-core NPU with 44 TOPS — similar to what Qualcomm is offering on the 8 Elite. Xiaomi notes that this is just the start in a decade-long investment that's set to exceed 6.9 billion USD, with 2,500 engineers working in its chip division.</p><p>Xiaomi dabbled in custom chip design with the Surge S1 back in 2017, but that was aimed at the budget category, and it isn't anything as ambitious as what the manufacturing is doing now. In fact, Xiaomi is so confident about what it has achieved that it slotted in the Xring O1 in its latest products: the Xiaomi 15S Pro and Pad 7 Ultra tablet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="n5HxFCYZzQgK2vZe2K4AGb" name="Xiaomi 15S Pro" alt="Xiaomi 15S Pro render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5HxFCYZzQgK2vZe2K4AGb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 15S Pro is identical to the 15 Pro that debuted at the end of last year, with the only key difference being the switch to the Xring O1 silicon. The phone has a new design and comes with 512GB of UFS 4.1 storage as standard (instead of 256GB), and Xiaomi is limiting it to China.</p><p>The Pad 7 Ultra is of greater interest to me, as the tablet gets an oversized 14-inch OLED panel — a considerable upgrade from the 11.2-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-is-a-convincing-ipad-air-clone-that-costs-half-as-much">LCD-toting Pad 7</a> and Pad 7 Pro. It also has a massive 12,000mAh battery, and I'm excited to get my hands on it to see what the Xring O1 is able to deliver in a device of this size.</p><p>I'm interested in testing two things with the Xring O1: how the modem holds up, and battery efficiency. Xiaomi doesn't have an integrated modem, and is instead using an external MediaTek T800 modem that's built on a 4nm node. The use of an external modem usually affects battery efficiency, and it will be interesting to see how it runs in real-world scenarios against Qualcomm and MediaTek rivals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="FVncfJVfFUwJuUAns8WFj5" name="Xiaomi-Pad-7-Ultra" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Ultra render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FVncfJVfFUwJuUAns8WFj5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I haven't gotten my hands on the 15S Pro yet, but Chinese YouTuber Geekerwan did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=cB510ZeFe8w">extensive testing of the Xring O1</a> (the video is in Mandarin, but it has English subtitles) and found that it does better than the Dimensity 9400. Interestingly, the CPU has energy efficiency in line with what Qualcomm and MediaTek are delivering, and that's an achievement in and of itself.</p><p>However, testing the battery efficiency showed that the use of an external modem affected battery life, with the Qualcomm-based model lasting 40 minutes longer in the same test. Ultimately, Xiaomi needs to make its own 5G modem, and given how difficult that has proven to be for anyone other than Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Samsung, we'll just have to wait and see how the Chinese manufacturer does in this area.</p><p>In addition to the Xring O1, Xiaomi unveiled the Xring T1, a smartwatch platform that will see a decent amount of use on the brand's wearables. The timing of this announcement is interesting as it comes just a week after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/xiaomi-and-qualcomm-are-powering-the-future-together-with-a-multi-year-extension">Xiaomi and Qualcomm released a joint statement</a> extending their 15-year partnership, and confirming that upcoming Xiaomi flagships will continue to use Qualcomm silicon.</p><p>While it's entirely possible that Xiaomi uses Qualcomm for phones it releases globally, it's clear that the brand is positioning its own designs for devices that are exclusive to its home market. That's a significant shift in strategy, and at least based on the hardware the brand has detailed thus far, it's clear that the Xring O1 is able to hold its own against the Dimensity 9400 and Qualcomm's flagship silicon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Do you want XR glasses or AI glasses? Do you need a giant virtual display on your face, or would you rather be able to take pictures and video from your glasses? Do they need prescription frames? Be able to be worn all day? Wireless or USB?</p><p>Even once you determine what hardware specs you want, getting into the software part of the equation is truly overwhelming.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">AC thVRsday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC" name="ac-thvrsday-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="AC thVRsday logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.</p></div></div><p>That's because there's no standard for glasses software. It's a lot like the smartphone landscape of the mid-2000s, but this time, the major players don't have a full-fledged operating system that powers their glasses. Instead, it's a hodgepodge of random capabilities. For instance, some glasses, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a>, support spatial tracking out of the box, while others need you to download an app on your phone or computer for that functionality to work.</p><p>On the other side of the coin, AI glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> don't have an OS at all in the traditional sense. Sure, there's an operating system that runs the hardware and connects to your phone, but there's no way to interface with it directly as a user. Instead, a middleware program on your smartphone does all the work, including processing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/new-meta-ai-app-provides-llama-4-powered-challenge-to-gemini">Meta AI</a> queries and syncing your photos and videos to the cloud.</p><p>But every single one of these requires a different app from a different company, and <em>none</em> of them work together. So what's the fix? Hopefully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>.</p><h2 id="a-unified-software-platform-2">A unified software platform</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8xkX6WCMVdDqV3sqtavv59" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-3" alt="Michael Hicks wearing Android XR prototype glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8xkX6WCMVdDqV3sqtavv59.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's been a big debate in the XR community about whether <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye">Xreal Project Aura</a> is a "true" pair of smart glasses or just another "wearable display," as the company's existing glasses are. Xreal didn't exactly give us a lot of details when it unveiled the glasses, but it made one thing clear: these are powered by Android XR.</p><p>At the end of the day, that means that Xreal Project Aura glasses should be able to run the same apps and basic features as every other pair of Android XR-powered smart glasses. That's good for you and me because it means we can expect things to work well rather than wondering how many Reddit threads you're going to have to scroll through in the dead of night to cobble together a hack job.</p><p>Wear OS is the closest equivalent to Android XR that we have available, as it not only powers standalone wearable devices that are primarily designed to connect to your phone for communication, but it also ensures that all of these devices have a base set of functionality to work from.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1586px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Xbyk4gvQHVzCbah7aBVC3j" name="3D Google Maps view through Android XR smart glasses" alt="3D Google Maps view through Android XR smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xbyk4gvQHVzCbah7aBVC3j.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1586" height="892" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like smartwatches powered by Wear OS, smart glasses powered by Android XR will be able to run apps and services from the Google Play Store. Just as you would expect of apps on a tiny watch screen, some of these apps will need to be specifically designed for use with smart glasses and the different screens those devices will employ.</p><p>Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google smart glasses reference design from Google I/O</a> as a good example. These glasses feature a monocular display, which means the display is only in one lens. It's a relatively small square that only takes up a portion of your field of view. In essence, it's a slightly larger smartwatch screen for your face.</p><p>Google demoed the glasses on stage — you can see it in the image above — and that demo gives you the perfect example of what you can expect from apps on these screens.</p><h2 id="meeting-expectations-2">Meeting expectations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE" name="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" alt="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1584" height="891" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we don't know all the capabilities of Android XR-powered smart glasses just yet, we have an idea of what Google is aiming for based on what it showed us so far. Android XR should power the two main types of smart glasses — mainly glasses with screens and glasses without any screens — yet offer an effortless way to get the content you want on them.</p><p>Right now, it's not clear if Google will require all glasses to support 6DoF movement, but the pair Google showed off at I/O this year included a display engine, speakers, and a mic onboard. We know Google is working with Qualcomm on Android XR development, but we don't know if all glasses will have to have an independent chip inside for processing. But, thankfully, none of that matters if Android XR can offload these tasks to your phone. Basic capabilities will work, regardless of how your glasses handle the task.</p><p>If a Google Play Store app is made for Android XR glasses with a display, it will work on any pair with a display, just as you would expect any Wear OS watch to run any Google Play Store app designed for Wear OS. There will always be exceptions to this rule, just as there are on phones and smartwatches, but the vast, vast majority of experiences will work everywhere.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-5" alt="Android XR prototype glasses and Pixel smartphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's not clear right now is if Google is allowing different types of displays on glasses or if it'll mandate a specific size or shape for the early days of the OS. We'll just have to wait until later this year to find out, specifically regarding Xreal Project Aura since that pair is shrouded in so much mystery.</p><p>But glasses with and without screens should always be able to tie into Gemini, just as a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses always tie into Meta AI. This ensures that you can ask Gemini to do what you need and never have to worry whether your glasses support the feature. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is a base part of Android XR, as Google has laid out many times, and that will ensure you can do what you want, regardless of what company makes your favorite pair of smart glasses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xobnQS7SntjuXsTvXqS5j6" name="android-xr-assistance-and-coaching" alt="Google's assistance and coaching pillar concept of Gemini on Android XR devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xobnQS7SntjuXsTvXqS5j6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYMt7Ddzz6Y">Google's Android XR pillars</a> is allowing Gemini to offer "assistance and coaching" for users. This means that Gemini can look through the cameras on your glasses and not only understand what you're looking at, but also offer helpful information. It's like using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">Gemini Live</a> on your phone, except a lot less awkward, and letting you free up both hands.</p><p>Google's decade-old "Be together, not the same" Android slogan is coming full force with Android XR, and I couldn't be happier about it. Android XR will ensure that you can buy the smart glasses you want and not worry about whether they'll work the way you expect. It's the unification we've needed in the smart glasses space for years, and it'll ensure that smart glasses become as ubiquitous as smart watches, if not more so.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Gemini is all over Google's ecosystem, and the Home app is no different. Today (May 22), Google introduced Gemini-powered smart home automations. The company states the AI is designed to make "powerful routine creation easier than ever."</p><p>One Gemini-powered feature Google mentioned was "help me create." This is something the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-help-me-create-public-preview">first debuted in Home's Public Preview</a> late last year. Regardless, Google says users can use conversational language to get the AI/automation to do what they require. The AI will process your instructions and produce an automation/routine that might satisfy what you're looking to achieve.</p><p>Google also states it's adding more automation starters. Essentially, users will find triggers based on "dates and weather conditions." Lastly, Gemini will "analyze" a user's smart home devices to provide automation suggestions.</p><p>Gemini's influences don't end there, as Google says users can ask the AI about their smart home devices from its main app on Android. Additionally, Google is starting a "Home Summary" widget test.</p><h2 id="widget-test-cameras-and-partners-2">Widget Test, Cameras, and Partners</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1128px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.19%;"><img id="p73h2xeUcpvcXVGWSAvkQS" name="google-home-io-2025-home-summary-widget-test" alt="Google is beginning a test for a "Home Summary" widget that gives a brief overview of what's happened at home and the choice to "view" certain actions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p73h2xeUcpvcXVGWSAvkQS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1128" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1145px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.40%;"><img id="uSaUSKEVn7EQUUpT8KfWRS" name="google-home-io-2025-gemini-automations" alt="Google Gemini will assist Home users with its "help me create" prompt for automations/routines." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uSaUSKEVn7EQUUpT8KfWRS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1145" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>This Home Summary test will concern a small group of Pixel users going forward.

What this test encompasses is 3D photos. This new way to experience pictures while scrolling away on Instagram is only available through the Meta Quest VR headset.</p><p>Meta states Instagram's test will leverage Reality Labs' "AI view synthesis algorithms" to convert your typical flat photo (2D) into an immersive 3D format.</p><p>This simulated "immersion" is done by giving the 2D images "depth," per Meta. The company says users will be able to "see" a little bit of movement in these photos that give them a more lifelike appearance. Meta gives the example of seeing the arc of a soccer ball flying through the air or the cutest little Eskimo kiss.</p><p>As previously stated, this test is limited to not everyone will see these 3D photos on Instagram when wearing a Quest headset. Moreover, it might take some time before those who are involved will see it, so keep your eyes peeled.</p><h2 id="a-meta-test-android-xr-s-future-2">A Meta test & Android XR's Future</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="g48GH8F95kMaCYESDGMmW6" name="meta-quest-navigator-library-revamp" alt="A snapshot of Meta's revamped "Navigator," which revamps the the library view for users to access games, apps, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g48GH8F95kMaCYESDGMmW6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1068" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere, Meta detailed a new test today (May 22) for users enrolled in its PTC (Public Test Channel). Users will find the new "Navigator," which is your new home for your apps, games, friends, settings, and more. Testers can pin up to 10 apps in their library for quicker access. However, if you don't feel like pinning anything, the library will show your most recently used apps, which (sort of) serves the same purpose.</p><p>Those interested can dive into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/172903867975450/?intern_source=blog&intern_content=instagram-3d-photos-spatial-medianavigator-meta-quest-test">the full v77 patch notes</a> for Horizon OS and expect to see it hit your device soon.</p><p>Regarding Instagram's spatial scrolling test, Meta's already doing what Android XR <em>intends </em>to do across Google's apps. Android XR had its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">time in the sun during I/O 2025</a>, which involved the company discussing its plans for Gemini-powered smart glasses and AR glasses. During the event, Nishtha Bhatia, product manager, building and bringing consumer experiences at Google, demoed the company's glasses.</p><p>Specifically, Bhatia showed off Gemini's memory capabilities. This was something we saw once previously during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">Google's TED 2025 demo</a>. Bhatia asked Gemini if it remembered the name of a coffee shop on a mug. Gemini remembered, promptly pulling it up for display, as well as a description of the cafe. The AI also offered directions to that coffee shop.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This newfound (enhanced) integration will bring the AI model Gemini to OPPO's app environment, previously upgraded through ColorOS 15 (Android 15).</p><p>OPPO's president of software engineering, Kai Tang, said, "With the Reno14 Series, we are collaborating closely with Google to systematically integrate Google Gemini into OPPO core apps. This integration will enable users to effortlessly perform complex actions across multiple apps using simple natural language queries, significantly enhancing AI convenience."</p><p>OPPO teases "multi-app" journeys for future Reno 14 users and Gemini. This will let users ask Gemini to complete complex tasks that involve one or more apps. As an example, OPPO states users can ask Gemini to summarize a document and save those condensed notes in the OPPO Notes app.</p><p>The phones will also leverage Gemini's analyzing capabilities for YouTube videos, enabling the AI to grab "essential steps from recipe tutorials" and save them elsewhere.</p><h2 id="oppo-s-ai-journey-2">OPPO's AI Journey</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XBhVkqfqwBGRs4uvk8JkzG" name="Oppo-annouces-AI-strategy" alt="Darren Chen, Director of AI Technology Strategic Planning, OPPO" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XBhVkqfqwBGRs4uvk8JkzG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OPPO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While future Reno 14 series users can expect Gemini's influence across multiple OPPO apps, the company states that the assortment will include its Calendar and Clock apps alongside Notes.</p><p>As OPPO and Google move closer, for the sake of on-device AI assistance, the former has marked this development as a "significant milestone" in its commitment.

The company's collaboration with Google was discussed then, as well as its work with MediaTek. ColorOS 15 leaned heavily on Gemini 1.5 Pro and Google's Flash model "to cross-communicate with OPPO native apps."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

With that, interested users can order the device today on Verizon.com or the My Verizon app. The provider adds consumers can also find the phone "in stores nationwide."</p><p>Verizon states the foldable is available for $16.66 per month for 36 months (0% APR). The post adds consumers could also get it on them if they trade in their old smartphone in "any condition on myPlan." However, Verizon is specifically interested in trade-in phones from Google, Motorola, Apple, and Samsung. If done, users will be eligible for a three-year price lock "on all myPlan and myHome network plans and free satellite texting." The "lock" refers to the "base monthly rate."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Moto Razr 2025</a> is available in the following colors: Gibraltar Sea, Spring Bud, and Parfait Pink.</p><p>Verizon is offering an additional perk for its customers, stating they can grab five streaming services (Netflix, Max, Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus) for $20 a month.</p><h2 id="moto-s-2025-razr-is-here-2">Moto's 2025 Razr is Here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hUdYMBa8wqJh8LQTDgahua" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-27" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in the Pantone Lightest Sky colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hUdYMBa8wqJh8LQTDgahua.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not only has the Moto Razr 2025 arrived at Verizon, but it's also appeared for Straight Talk, Total Wireless, and Visible.</p><p>There's still a little uncertainty behind <em>why </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorolas-2025-razr-rollout-hits-a-weird-pause-for-certain-carriers">Verizon and Motorola delayed</a> the Razr 2025's arrival.

With IP68 and IP69 water and dust resistance, a 200MP main camera, DC-dimmed display capable of 3840Hz PWM dimming at low brightness, and six years of software updates coming, there are plenty of reasons to be impressed with the Honor 400 Pro.</p><p>While there are many parts of a phone you might care about, a phone's display and camera system are the most important things to me. But Honor has steep competition at this price. From the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a>, or even the iPhone 16e, there's no shortage of options to choose from.</p><p>I'm taking a look at how the Honor 400 Pro compares with the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE camera, in particular, as it's the phone most people would likely choose if given a lineup of similarly-priced devices. Honor also has the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-review">Honor 400</a>, and that goes up against the Galaxy A56.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-400-pro-camera-review-specs-and-modes"><span>Honor 400 Pro camera review: specs and modes</span></h3><div ><table><caption>Honor 400 Pro camera specs</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Main camera</p></td><td  ><p>200MP, f/1.9, 1/1.4-inch size, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Telephoto camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/2.0, 1/2-inch size, OIS, Sony IMX856</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ultrawide camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2, 112-degree FoV, autofocus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, fixed focus</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The camera hardware on the Honor 400 Pro looks a lot more like a flagship phone than a mid-range one. Not only does it have three rear cameras — something that gives it an immediate advantage over the Pixel 9a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> — but Honor's camera software is basically unmatched in its quality, too.</p><p>Last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-photography-oppo-honor-mwc-2024">I was blown away</a> by what Honor was able to do with AI. While it wasn't quite the all-encompassing buzzword it is today, Honor has fully leaned into the AI domain and describes nearly every mode and feature with the term. It's overused, for sure, but it doesn't make the results any less impressive. Here's a list of all the main modes and editing options you'll get with the Honor 400 Pro:</p><h2 id="honor-image-engine-2">Honor image engine</h2><ul><li>AI Super Zoom</li><li>AI Portrait Snap</li><li>AI Enhanced Portrait</li><li>Al Focal Lengths Portrait</li><li>HD Moving Photo</li><li>Film Simulation Mode</li><li>Harcourt Portrait Mode</li><li>AI Motion Sensing Capture</li></ul><h2 id="ai-editing-2">AI editing</h2><ul><li>AI Image to Video</li><li>AI Eraser</li><li>AI Erase Passers-by</li><li>AI Remove Reflection</li><li>Moving Photo Collage</li><li>AI Outpainting</li><li>AI Upscale</li><li>AI Cutout</li><li>AI Face Tune</li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-400-pro-camera-review-main-camera"><span>Honor 400 Pro camera review: Main camera</span></h3><p>The Honor 400 Pro's 200MP main camera is impressive on paper and in action. When compared to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, there's a clear stylistic difference between the two cameras. Samsung pushes for maximum dynamic range, which often results in very bright shadow areas and sometimes washed out colors.</p><p>In both daylight examples below, the sky is the wrong shade of blue and the green hue of the plants is a little too bright on Samsung's photos. Honor opts for a much richer, deeper color palette and it ends up looking a lot more realistic because of the decision.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="2NCdaonxwrACiz6xJ58Jqc" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-main-01" alt="Daylight camera samples comparing the Honor 400 Pro to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2NCdaonxwrACiz6xJ58Jqc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="5DzsXs3nTvXAuTbUaj7Drc" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-main-03" alt="Daylight camera samples comparing the Honor 400 Pro to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5DzsXs3nTvXAuTbUaj7Drc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As we move indoors and into darker environments, we see the same scenario play out. Samsung's goal is seemingly to make the brightest image possible, often at the detriment of color accuracy. Neither photo looks bad by any means, but Honor's processing ends up looking better and sporting more realistic colors because the company pushes for a more contrast-heavy look, something Pixels have been renowned for historically.</p><p>One of the biggest differences between the photos is the handling of bight light sources in dark rooms where the Honor 400 Pro takes a serious lead. The windows are totally blown out in the Galaxy S24 FE's shot. Meanwhile, they're not only well balanced in the Honor 400 Pro's shot but you can actually make out details.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="Bg8DQcmH8kZW6WBBhKzWxf" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-main-04" alt="Photo samples comparing the Honor 400 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 FE in darker environments" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bg8DQcmH8kZW6WBBhKzWxf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="MAzY4D9HafmEC8BvgZEiyf" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-main-05" alt="Photo samples comparing the Honor 400 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 FE in darker environments" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MAzY4D9HafmEC8BvgZEiyf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="N8ALPkRVJXh3ZnAnMq5p6g" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-main-02" alt="Photo samples comparing the Honor 400 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 FE in darker environments" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8ALPkRVJXh3ZnAnMq5p6g.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-400-pro-camera-review-motion-capture-and-portraits"><span>Honor 400 Pro camera review: Motion capture and portraits</span></h3><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>, Honor's motion capture capabilities have become second to none. The company uses a highly-trained AI algorithm to help understand what the camera sees and capture moving objects based on that algorithm. The result is that you almost always get a crisp subject even when the person, pet, or thing is moving the entire time.</p><p>I tested this out on several subjects, but these two examples illustrate the main differences between the Galaxy S24 FE and the Honor 400 Pro's motion capture capabilities. Even in broad daylight, the Galaxy S24 FE struggles to capture an object in motion, something that should come as no surprise to anyone who has ever used a Samsung phone.</p><p>Honor pointed out that the Honor 400 Pro can capture moving subjects even when using portrait mode this time, and I found the results to be very impressive, so I put it to the test indoors where the light isn't so bright. The Honor 400 Pro did a fantastic job capturing me swinging a sword around in VR, even getting the colors and little details on the headset crisp. The Galaxy S24 FE's colors are not only wrong, but I'm very blurry because of the movement.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="cY3WPJcj3kiWgXvL4B8zQ3" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-motion-01" alt="Comparing the motion capture quality of the Honor 400 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy S24 FE's cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cY3WPJcj3kiWgXvL4B8zQ3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="jMfoSoBsm6cM3hYJHrMAJ3" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-motion-02" alt="Comparing the motion capture quality of the Honor 400 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy S24 FE's cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jMfoSoBsm6cM3hYJHrMAJ3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Samsung phones have produced some of the best portrait mode photos for years, but last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200 Pro</a> gave Honor the edge it needed.

In the two darker indoor shots, the Honor 400 Pro nailed the color of the wood and did a superb job with the lighting. The contrast on the Honor 400 Pro's photos are excellent, while the Galaxy S24 FE is too bright in both shots, particularly in the library with the light leakage from the windows.</p><p>Even during the day, there's an obvious different in color accuracy, clarity, and overall details on the Honor 400 Pro versus the Galaxy S24 FE.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="7PdNzbdETEAMyyEkkL5DcR" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-2x-02" alt="Comparing 2x zoom photos taken from an Honor 400 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PdNzbdETEAMyyEkkL5DcR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="NpYhvRvSWygF2kHpWFJ5mR" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-2x-01" alt="Comparing 2x zoom photos taken from an Honor 400 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NpYhvRvSWygF2kHpWFJ5mR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="nsk52scGwGbjRcaiykdEjR" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-2x-03" alt="Comparing 2x zoom photos taken from an Honor 400 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsk52scGwGbjRcaiykdEjR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Zooming in 3x or greater uses the telephoto sensor on both phones, and it's once again clear which ones does it better the moment you look at any photo.

Both are a 12MP sensor, but the Honor 400 Pro's is capable of autofocus, helping it to double as a macro camera. To get the same types of macro shots on the Galaxy S24 FE, you'll have to use the 2x zoom button to use the main sensor rather than getting up close to the subject. The result is a significantly better photo from the Honor 400 Pro, with crisper details and better contrast.</p><p>Otherwise, ultrawide camera performance is largely identical between the two phones. As a rule of thumb, it seems like the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE's ultrawide camera captures marginally better fine detail, while I prefer the colors and contrast of the Honor 400 Pro's ultrawide camera.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="c23aNyWtGbHKH6deMpPSvH" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-macro-01" alt="Comparing ultrawide camera samples between the Honor 400 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c23aNyWtGbHKH6deMpPSvH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="ruwoRjkRPdTifppgJMQ84J" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-ultrawide-01" alt="Comparing ultrawide camera samples between the Honor 400 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ruwoRjkRPdTifppgJMQ84J.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="breSvLdTRjVecvkUHaR7xH" name="honor-400-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-ultrawide-02" alt="Comparing ultrawide camera samples between the Honor 400 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/breSvLdTRjVecvkUHaR7xH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The front-facing cameras couldn't be more different on paper. The Honor 400 Pro uses a new 50MP front-facing camera sensor, while the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE uses a 10MP one. Both are fixed focus sensors with no real depth to them, so using portrait mode is important if you want that classic photo feel.</p><p>I expect good portrait results from both companies and neither phone disappoints there. Both feature clean cutouts of me and my pet hen, but the Honor 400 Pro's background blurring is more subtle than the Galaxy S24 FE's. As has been the case in this entire review, the Honor 400 Pro's colors and contrast are better, giving it a better overall look.</p><p>Darker environments showcase less of a difference between the two, but those differences remain the same.

Honor's processing is just plain better than Samsung's, with better contrast, more accurate colors, more correct emphasis on prioritizing subjects over backgrounds, substantially better motion capture quality, and greater zoom detail overall.</p><p>It's actually hard to find a weak point with the Honor 400 Pro's camera, as it does <em>everything</em> exceedingly well and doesn't seem to struggle no matter what mode is selected. The worst thing I can say about it is that its ultrawide camera isn't better than the Galaxy S24 FE's when taking wide-angle shots, but that changes when getting in close as the Honor 400 Pro's ultrawide camera can use autofocus, allowing it to be used as a 50MP macro camera.</p><p>If you're in the market for a good new mid-range phone, there's no better choice than the Honor 400 Pro. It's got a great eye-friendly display which is significantly better than the Pixel 9a or Galaxy S24 FE's screen, six years of software updates to come, a stronger build and design than most phones (not just mid-range ones), plus what's clearly the best mid-range camera you'll find anywhere.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6bbc710c-1a42-47d5-82af-1b3665a930da">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eyJGrGXxU6jBipxkHMaiw6.png' alt="An official product render of the grey Honor 400 Pro"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Honor 400 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Honor 400 Pro is the mid-range phone with a flagship camera, IP68 and IP69 water and dust protection ratings, six years of software updates to come, and all the AI tricks you ever wanted.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Honor's strategy revolves around its foldables and flagships — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a> — but its mid-tier devices are also seeing decent momentum. It sold over 45 million units of its mid-rangers globally starting with the Honor 50, and that's quite decent. Interestingly, Honor is the fastest-growing phone brand in the U.K. at a time when other manufacturers are seeing growth stagnate or decline, and the brand is continuing to bolster its presence in the region.</p><p>That brings us to the Honor 400. The follow-up to last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200</a>, the Honor 400 has a new design, updated hardware, and a new 200MP camera at the back that take even better photos and videos. There are downgrades; the phone charges at 66W (instead of 100W), and it misses out on a tele lens this year — that's exclusive to the Pro model.</p><p>It's clear that Honor is positioning the device as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-a56-is-the-worst-mid-range-phone-i-used-in-2025">alternative to the Galaxy A56</a>. If anything, Samsung made that job much easier this year by refusing to make any tangible upgrades to the A56. Even though the Honor 400 misses out on a tele lens, it does a better job in just about every measurable area against the Galaxy A56, and if you need a mid-ranger with a good design and great camera at the back, this is the phone to buy.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-400-pricing-and-availability"><span>Honor 400: Pricing and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mGDWJXuMUEtDbgqqRdBJp4" name="Honor 400" alt="Honor 400 back view against blue and red background with Honor logo highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mGDWJXuMUEtDbgqqRdBJp4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor unveiled the Honor 400 and Honor 400 Pro at an event in London on May 22, and both phones are going on sale in select regions starting in June. The standard model of the Honor 400 comes with 256GB of storage, and it costs €499 ($565) — €50 more than the equivalent A56. There's also a 512GB variant that comes in at €549 ($621).</p><p>If you need a tele lens, you'll need to get your hands on the Honor 400 Pro. The phone gets better hardware and 100W charging alongside a 50MP 3x tele module, but you'll be shelling out €799 ($905). Of the two, the standard model is the better value by a big margin.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-400-design"><span>Honor 400: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="MWe9hDxdgzAyEko4BJpf35" name="Honor 400" alt="Honor 400 back view against blue and red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MWe9hDxdgzAyEko4BJpf35.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like what Honor is doing with the design of its products, and the Honor 400 is no different.

photos and videos. Nebulous claims aside, the phone does a decent enough job in most conditions; daylight shots have plenty of detail and good color rendition, and the device does well in challenging scenarios as well, producing detailed photos.</p><p>The wide-angle lens is average, and that's usually the case with most mid-rangers. Where the Honor 400 truly shines is with portrait shots; it renewed its collaboration with Harcourt, and you get a range of filters that alter the look of the shot. I still prefer what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-v50-proves-that-iterative-updates-can-still-be-fun">Vivo V50</a> does in this area, but I'll have to admit that the Honor 400 comes mighty close.</p><p>At the end of the day, the camera on the Honor 400 is quite good. It handles most tasks well, and while it doesn't have much in the way of versatility, it is better than the Galaxy A56, and I guess that's what Honor was aiming to achieve.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-400-software"><span>Honor 400: Software</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="RyLnGeQ85f2nwZuNXpzWi5" name="Honor 400" alt="Honor 400 notification pane against red and blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RyLnGeQ85f2nwZuNXpzWi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5119" height="2883" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phone brands are leaning heavily into AI to differentiate their products, and Honor has a definite vision around how this will look on its devices. The brand does a good job with AI utilities in general, and refreshingly, it didn't limit any features in the Honor 400 — unlike Samsung with the Galaxy A56.</p><p>If anything, the device is slated to get a brand-new image to video utility that relies on Google's Veo 2 engine. Honor has a full-fledged AI suite with the usual tools: real-time translations, audio transcribing, writing assistance, and image as well as video editing. There's also Honor Connect, a utility designed to make it easier to connect to iPhones.</p><p>The phone comes with MagicOS 9.0 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and while the interface is broadly similar to previous iterations, there are a few subtle changes that make it a little cleaner. Honor's devices had longstanding issues with haptics, and the brand is finally addressing those problems.</p><p>I didn't see any problems in day-to-day usability; the interface is fluid, and it has a decent amount of customizability. I'm not a fan of the split notification pane, and I would have liked a unified shade instead. Other than that, it's just as effortless to use the Honor 400 as the Magic 7 Pro.</p><p>In other good news, the phone will get six Android OS updates alongside six years of security updates, and that is in line with the Galaxy A56. In fact, only the Pixel 9a will get more updates in this category, and Honor is clearly winning against its Chinese rivals in this area.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-400-the-alternatives"><span>Honor 400: The alternatives</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rpfFcHfSZwGgVhgaKoCiWo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpfFcHfSZwGgVhgaKoCiWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, the Pixel 9a deserves a mention in this category. Google's latest mid-ranger has a minimalist design, decent hardware, a bright OLED panel, and fabulous cameras at the back. It also has a clean software with extensive AI features, and it will get an additional software update over the Honor 400.</p><p>If you need the best hardware in this category, then you should consider the OnePlus 13R. It has good cameras, a bigger 6,000mAh battery, and decent software. It won't get as many software updates, but other than that, it is a solid choice if you want a gaming-focused mid-range device.</p><p>If you need the best value, the POCO F7 Pro is unmatched. It has high-end hardware and a bright OLED panel with 6,000mAh battery, and it excels as a gaming device. It has decent cameras as well, but the software isn't as good as the Honor 400, nor will it get as many software updates.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-400-should-you-buy-it"><span>Honor 400: Should you buy it?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5179px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="8dDTWNEsAqrVxEAhuQYcS5" name="Honor 400" alt="Honor 400 back view against blue and red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8dDTWNEsAqrVxEAhuQYcS5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5179" height="2917" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You're a long-time Samsung user</li><li>You need a phone with a good in-hand feel</li><li>You want great cameras at the back</li><li>You need fast charging and all-day battery life</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need a telephoto lens</li></ul><p>On the whole, the Honor 400 is a good update to its predecessor. The new camera at the back does a great job with photos in general, and the phone lasts all day with relative ease even though it's smaller than most of its rivals. The internals aren't quite up to scratch, and if you want a phone predominantly for mobile gaming, there are much better choices available.</p><p>I like what Honor is doing with the software as well, and its AI suite is better than most other brands in this category. Honor is clearly going after Samsung with the device, and after using both, I can safely say that the Honor 400 is a much better choice than the Galaxy A56 in the areas that actually matter.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="80582e8b-5e62-449a-a964-0247d15b034b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:125.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wxrwsiPLc8QAuEeSDy5Nc8.jpg' alt="Honor 400 render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Honor 400</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Honor 400 is much better than the Galaxy A56; it has a brighter OLED panel, better camera at the back, and a bigger battery.

Wear OS 6 will fix that by adding a Watch Face Push API that lets any 3rd-party app have a watch face Slot next to Google's native faces.</p><p>In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/whats-new-in-watch-faces.html">Android Developers post</a>, the Wear OS team outlined how developers can "create their own watch face marketplaces" of XML Watch Face Format (WFF) faces. Up until now, devs had to individually post watch faces in the Play Store, making them hard to find.</p><p>Google partnered with Facer, TIMEFLIK, WatchMaker, Pujie, and Recreative, the first watch face app stores that will work on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> watches this fall.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1292px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.93%;"><img id="r8aJDaX7yefLvuNpdkpr4e" name="Watch-Face-API-Facer-Recreative-TIMEFLIK" alt="Renders of three Android phones on a gray background, each showing a different watch face app with 3rd-party options: Facer (left), Recreative (center), and TIMEFLIK (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r8aJDaX7yefLvuNpdkpr4e.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1292" height="658" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Facer (<em>left</em>), Recreative (<em>center</em>), and TIMEFLIK (<em>right</em>) watch face apps </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / Facer / Recreative / TIMEFLIK)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With Facer, for example, you'll be able to pick between thousands of faces; selecting one in the mobile app will have it sync automatically on the future <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> display.</p><p>WFF faces will also get more dynamic on Wear OS 6, starting with user-selected photos. Devs can change the color of an element based on the value, such as brighter colors for higher temperatures or UV levels. Text will auto-size to fit the space, so you can fit a wider range of values (such as higher step counts) in a single area. And faces can now "transition" from always-on to active mode, rather than instantly switching.</p><p>Still, WFF has limitations compared to old formats. It cuts Facer's 500,000+ watch face library down into the low thousands, most of which it had to transition manually.</p><p>So I spoke to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/facer-hired-fossil-wear-os-exec-and-it-sounds-like-a-perfect-match">Brook Eaton, Facer's new CPO</a> and former Fossil exec, about the Facer-Google partnership and what to expect from this new watch face system.</p><h2 id="google-was-very-understanding-of-what-facer-needed-2">Google was 'very understanding' of what Facer needed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cLU4cq5oNV9uMKHJTXJEqH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-facer-pokemon-2.jpeg" alt="A custom Facer watch face showing Mewtwo in a pod on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cLU4cq5oNV9uMKHJTXJEqH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">This  Facer watch face tracked battery drain (and also caused it) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">Wear OS 5 blocked Facer</a> and hurt its outreach to Android users, Eaton explained that he "understood Google's logic" for why it forced the WFF move.</p><p>Old animated watch faces were "not how watch faces were intended to be displayed," Eaton said, because it was more like an always-on app that constantly pulled data from the system and sensors. And when it burned through the battery, users would contact watch <em>hardware</em> makers like Fossil to complain about the terrible battery life.</p><p>WFF, as it exists today, relies on recent cached sensor data to display it without that constant drain, reflecting what users want to see in a "more consolidated and platform-centric way."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="yECoChLn3ektEctiFuAiE7" name="Wear-OS-6-dynamic-theme-options" alt="The Color theme settings screen on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing the primary "Match watch face" view and some set theme options like Moonstone and Ivy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yECoChLn3ektEctiFuAiE7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3720" height="2093" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Wear OS 6 will add more watch face variety and better theming </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Facer says that around the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> launch, it was "actively discussing a resolution with Google" but that the "change was unfortunately rolled out before a solution could be reached." But that didn't mean Google and Facer stopped talking; the target simply moved from OS 5 to OS 6 to fix things.</p><p>Google "wants their ecosystem to succeed," Eaton said, which means "understanding the pain points" of partners. For "decently-sized engineering teams" who do a lot of business on Google platforms, "they'll work with you" to solve a problem so long as "everyone will benefit from it," not just one specific app or partner.</p><p>So Facer (and presumably other watch face apps) convinced Google that it was in everyone's best interest for the Watch Face Push API to bring back third-party faces. It's <em>still</em> working on convincing Google to upgrade WFF to become more dynamic.</p><h2 id="how-facer-will-work-on-wear-os-6-and-in-the-future-2">How Facer will work on Wear OS 6 (and in the future)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1378px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="BYEPwJexfHhTCFiiFJbvcK" name="facer-creator-app" alt="A render of the Facer Creator tool, where developers can make watch faces for Wear OS 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYEPwJexfHhTCFiiFJbvcK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1378" height="775" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Facer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On current Wear OS 5 watches, all Facer can do is link to WFF faces in the Play Store. But it didn't want the "headache" of adding thousands of individually-managed faces to the store, so only a few of the most popular faces are available now.</p><p>Facer is still waiting for the Wear OS 6 rollout, when thousands of its "high demand" faces will all be available for free, à la carte, or through their Facer Premium subscription.</p><p>Facer had to choose which old faces were a "good match" to convert easily to WFF, and which popular faces required more of an "elegant degradation," where some features had to be cut while others transitioned to a battery-efficient version.</p><p>Eaton says they're still sending "feature requests" to Google, with 3D faces as a major one. But again, Google wants to "understand why" it's necessary before adding any feature, so it may take time — or may not happen. People hoping all their old Facer favorites will transition should temper their expectations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3736px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="B9Wcro8NBpurKNkp9nXZTo" name="Wear-OS-6-applying-dynamic-color-theming" alt="The "Applying theme" screen on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing a Paint icon above a circle showing a primary color (beige) and two secondary colors (black, pink)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B9Wcro8NBpurKNkp9nXZTo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3736" height="2102" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, Eaton says, the Facer Creator tool will focus on helping developers create WFF faces so that they're ready by the time Wear OS 6 launches.

Again. We saw a lot of neat demos, including some things that will never see the light of day (I still want Google Assistant to make me a barber shop appointment) as well as plenty of things that are here now or on the way very soon.</p><p>Interestingly enough, if you watched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjvgtwSOCao">Google I/O Developer Keynote</a> presentation, you heard over and over how Google Gemini's new models will be your own powerhouse developer tool, even allowing you to create code out of thin air and a text prompt. Is that even real?</p><p>Sort of. The demos you might see of people using AI to write simple software are very real, and AI is completely capable of doing this. AI was trained using many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">free code examples</a>, so it "knows" the correct syntax and structure of most development languages. These examples also provide context for how to do many simple tasks inside a program.</p><p>This means that yes, AI can build an app or even a game. Here's a good example of someone doing it in a video that you can check out for more information.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/umubCK44Fw0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>As you can see, if you know a little bit about what you're doing and what you want to achieve, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Google Gemini</a> can build a simple text-based game. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-put-chatgpt-on-galaxy-watch-pixel-watch-wear-os">ChatGPT</a> and the other chatbots out there can do the same; Google doesn't have a monopoly on the idea.</p><p>You can also see that it's not a very good game. You will find similar walkthroughs of building phone apps with AI, where you end up with a bunch of code to copy and paste into your code editor and let the magic happen. They, too, aren't very good. This is because of AI limitations.</p><p>AI is really good at being a nerd, but it's terrible at being an artist. What I mean is that AI will follow instructions to the letter, and goofy bugs aside, it will get it right. What it can't do is think or create anything from scratch.</p><p>Even when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-does-ai-create-an-image">use AI to make a picture or video</a>, it's just pulling the data about what you asked for from its pool of saved data and placing it where you asked it to be placed, doing the things you told it to do. It creates nothing on its own.</p><p>That means any app that is created by an AI is going to be... not very good. AI in its current tech can't replace a human developer and the extra touches one can give to software, like a great interface or a fun game idea. One day it might be able to, but not now.</p><p>The good news is that AI is an awesome developer <strong>tool</strong>, even if it's not so good at doing all the work. You can use AI to help lay out your app elements, build the code's skeleton, find syntax errors, and do all sorts of tedious housekeeping duties. It's really good at it, too!</p> ]]></dc:content>

Most people will never get to try Beam, as it's an enterprise-grade piece of equipment that is sure to cost a small fortune, at least. I got to try it at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">Google I/O 2025</a>, and while it doesn't seem like a major improvement over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">last year's Starline experience</a>, it's still the best way to communicate remotely.</p><p>I wasn't allowed to take photos inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-brings-futuristic-3d-video-calls-with-google-beam">Google Beam</a> demo booth, but that's okay because the equipment looks identical to the setup Android Central captured at the 2024 event. I'm not even sure the hardware is changed — all the upgrades Google touted during its keynote are software-focused. There are three modules at the top and sides of the unit, with six cameras at multiple angles to capture the person accurately in 3D.</p><h2 id="google-s-magic-window-2">Google's "Magic Window"</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UF3R4FqNsoFnhN8rWh6BGG" name="google-project-starline-01.jpg" alt="The Project Starline booth" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UF3R4FqNsoFnhN8rWh6BGG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Project Starline demo booth at Google I/O 2024 looks identical to the one I tried at Google I/O 2025.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display uses a lenticular film to refract light emitted from a lightfield projection. In simple terms, the system is generating multiple video feeds, and the lenticular lens is refracting them into a single view that your eyes perceive as three-dimensional. If you're not sure what that looks like, think of the way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a> puts lifelike "eyes" on its outer display or the way a Nintendo 3DS used to provide 3D effects.</p><p>While the hardware seems generally unchanged, new in 2025 is AI-powered software. There's an AI volumetric video model that helps Beam combine multiple views coming in from the cameras in real time, creating a 3D representation of the person viewable on the other end of a call at 60 frames per second. It also incorporates head tracking that can recreate your movements as precisely as to the millimeter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6AimKU2bU7wLgdxKB8VtTR" name="Google-Beam-Box" alt="The Google Beam demo box at Google I/O 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6AimKU2bU7wLgdxKB8VtTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google touts the technology as being like "a magic window" and that it "feel[s] like you're there, together." That really is the best way to describe it. All of the awkwardness and lack of connection typically experienced during remote meetings is gone when using Beam.</p><p>It was so surreal talking with a Google representative through Beam hardware that at first, I didn't believe it was a two-way video call. The experience initially felt too good to be a live demo; it almost felt like it was pre-recorded to showcase Beam at its best.</p><p>Since this doesn't incorporate wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">AR or VR gear</a>, you never forget that the person you're chatting with isn't in the same room.

The 3D effect is lifelike, to the point that the Google presenter held out an apple, and it was as if I could reach forward and grab it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fTSMtiify22rJcv72t7W5R" name="google-io-ai-google-beam-02" alt="Google Beam at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fTSMtiify22rJcv72t7W5R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You feel innately comfortable chatting with a person using Google Beam, because there isn't the need to wear earbuds, look perfectly at a webcam, or deal with technical issues. It just works, and that means you can focus on what you're doing — whether that's an interview or a meeting.</p><h2 id="one-glaring-limitation-and-so-much-potential-2">One glaring limitation and so much potential</h2><p>The glaring limitation I noticed is that Beam is exclusively for one-on-one meetings at the moment. I thought it would be stellar if a company's team in one country could call another using Beam, bridging two conference rooms full of people. That's just simply not possible in the technology's current stage. Considering the potential high price of Beam hardware, the value proposition seems suspect for one-on-one conversations.</p><p>Soon, we'll learn more about Google Beam devices from HP, which will be revealed at InfoComm. From there, it'll ship to a few handpicked enterprise customers later in 2025. It's a big moment for Google, which has been working on Beam as Project Starline since 2021.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But on the second day of I/O, I stumbled upon a Pixel Watch 3 loaded with an early build of Wear OS 6, and I got to see Material 3 Expressive and the new Tiles in action.</p><p>Outside of the Android Village for the I/O dev sessions, I'd finished interrogating some poor Android XR devs following my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google glasses hands-on</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">Moohan hands-on</a> when I spotted two Pixel Watch 3 units with a colorful AOD "fully charged" screen I hadn't seen before.</p><p>I didn't fully investigate until I spoke to Dev Relations Engineer John Zoeller at the Q&A booth; he answered my Wear OS 6 questions by bringing me back to the Village. It turns out that those watches were running a proper test version of Wear OS 6, not just the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/6/setup">developer emulator version</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="bSji5hoyq5rC3R2WdWKaVM" name="Wear-OS-6-scrolling" alt="A Pixel Watch 3 held in hand showing the app drawer; the gif shows the holder scrolling up and down with his thumb, with apps shrinking at the top and bottom of the display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bSji5hoyq5rC3R2WdWKaVM.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The immediate highlight was the smooth-scrolling interface that shrinks and expands content, along with the new "Edge Hugging button" that slides out from the bottom with a shape to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> display edge.</p><p>In person, it worked exactly as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/whats-new-in-wear-os-6.html">developer blog</a> promised, without any noticeable lag detracting from the experience. Aside from the promised 10% battery boost, Zoeller promised that this version will have better performance than Wear OS 5 in the backend, despite the UI looking more complicated.</p><p>Unfortunately, this watch only had one notification, so it was hard to see the "<em>TransformingLazyColumn</em>" tool in action, which scales down Cards at the display's top and bottom.

Google's engineers acknowledged the limitations of rounded displays and turned it into a feature with shrinking, smooth-scrolling content, while adding theming to align its watches more closely with the Pixel phone experience.</p><p>My only negative with Wear OS 6 is that we'll have to wait until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> in late summer to get it, or even longer for last-gen Pixel Watches.

The publication states its sources have discovered model number S5E9955 in correlation with the next Flip. This number is said to be the Exynos 2500 in-house SoC from Samsung that we've heard about in recent months.</p><p>This creates an interesting narrative when it comes to the Flip 7's launch in various markets. What the post proposes is that Samsung could shy away from the Exynos 2500 in the U.S., Canada, and China. If true, then we're likely to see the same flagship Qualcomm chip as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a>: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite.</a></p><p>Where consumers might see the Exynos 2500 "in most countries," including India and South Korea. It's a notable change, if true, but it mirrors Samsung's previous decisions with its Galaxy S phones, delivering Exynos in some places and Qualcomm in others.</p><h2 id="hinge-changes-maybe-2">Hinge Changes? Maybe.</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qvvbSu5wsvePygZSzmTuKi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-23.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qvvbSu5wsvePygZSzmTuKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another rumor claims Samsung is looking into utilizing a titanium hinge for its upcoming foldables. Reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=35989">The Elec</a> (Korean), this hinge could arrive on Samsung's book-style foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 7, <em>and </em>its rumored tri-fold. The publication states the Korean OEM might chase this material due to the thickness of the Fold 7 and its trifold. It says titanium is "light and strong," which might better serve these bigger devices.</p><p>With that, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 wasn't mentioned as part of these titanium hinge improvements. So, that likely leaves consumers with the same hinge tech we've seen on the Flip 6.</p><p>Back to Exynos, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-might-not-use-a-snapdragon-chip-after-all">rumor from earlier in May</a> out of South Korea spoke on Samsung's chances to use its in-house chip over Qualcomm. There was uncertainty about this, considering in March, Samsung was rumored to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-exynos-2500-impact-rumors">run into yield/production issues</a> with the Exynos 2500. There were allegedly "severe" issues that "ruined" the chip, putting Samsung in an awkward corner.</p><p>The chip was also initially only suspected to debut in the rumored "Galaxy Z Flip FE," but we're now seeing the flagship Z Flip 7 tossed into the mix.</p><p>The performance of the Exynos 2500 was rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-exynos-2500-impact-rumors">to kick things up a notch</a> with a 10-core structure. Samsung's done that before; however, the 2500 could see an upgraded single Cortex X-5 CPU that could clock anywhere from 3.2 to 3.3GHz. The folks at SamMobile add that the device could also see 2x Cortex-A725, 5x Cortex-A725, and 2x Cortex-A520.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7, like the Fold 7, is expected to debut during Samsung's summer Unpacked.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

One of the major changes concerns how Google Photos displays your most recent Memories. There's a new, colorful card at the beginning of the carousel, encouraging users to "make a new memory" for a holiday or perhaps another significant event.</p><p>The same rectangular design remains for these cards; however, these cards no longer fully display a preview image. Instead, the tipster claims Google will display these cards with a heart-shaped cutout. Inside is a glimpse of the Memory with its title outside of the heart at the top.</p><p>The coloring of Google Photos leans against your device's current Material theme for its loading animations and bottom bar.</p><p>The tipster states that while Google's code suggests its expected "Expressive" redesign has progressed, there's still more. The post claims the Photos app <em>should </em>receive a "floating bottom bar" and "rounded image preview." The latter will also reportedly come with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-photos-homepage-redesign-3539859/">slight collage-style redesign</a> to display your pictures.</p><h2 id="android-16-s-getting-expressive-2">Android 16's getting Expressive</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.88%;"><img id="cEZeNbPKAj2fqRgHAFiquN" name="google-photos-expressive-memories-example" alt="A screenshot of Google Photos that shows the company's progress with its "Expressive" redesign by revamping its Memory cards with a heart-shaped cutout and more colorful accents." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEZeNbPKAj2fqRgHAFiquN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="268" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Considering Google still has more to do, when users can expect this is still up in the air. Either the company will roll this redesign out separately, or it will tie into its major Android 16 release.</p><p>Right after Google wrapped up I/O 2025 yesterday (May 20), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr1-beta-1-now-starts-rolling">Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1</a> appeared for Pixel owners. While the QPR release holds a few platform features and bug fixes, the biggest hot topic was the introduction of Material 3 Expressive, Google's new design language. Google says Expressive will be more vibrant and "engaging on an emotional level."</p><p>Much of Android 16's UI will change how users interact with it. The notification shade gets a revamp while the quick toggle section gains more room for 12 or more icons. Google also states Gmail will receive a major design overhaul, bringing it more in line with the rest of its Expressive plans.</p><p>If you're looking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">for a round-up</a>, the biggest announcements from I/O 2025 include even more Gemini AI and Android XR. The company put a spotlight on Gemini 2.5 and its major improvements, which Google says will make the model its "most intelligent" one yet. Gemini 2.5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-2-5-models-deep-think-flash-updates">is receiving upgrades</a> courtesy of Deep Think and Flash.

This feature has been around since the Galaxy S8, and until recently, was seeing regular enhancements. Now, I have a better idea as to why that was the case, given that Google has been "collaborating with Samsung, building on the foundation of Samsung DeX" for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16's Native desktop mode</a>.</p><p>With DeX or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-pixel-fold-have-a-desktop-mode">desktop mode</a>, you can turn your phone into a laptop or desktop just by connecting it to an external display. Many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">best Samsung tablets</a> can take it a step further, as you can natively switch between the traditional Android UI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>, thanks to the larger screens. All you need then is a pointer device and keyboard, and you're off to the races.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-dex-mode-classic-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Using Classic DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google has been working on something similar over the past few years, but it wasn't until last year that we saw any meaningful progress being made. Before now, desktop mode on Android was basically unusable, as the only UI was a background. Apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farmerbb.taskbar" target="_blank">Taskbar</a> made it possible to use desktop mode, complete with freeform multi-windows and an app drawer.</p><p>However, those barebone days will soon be long gone, as we're expecting to see desktop mode implemented in Android 16. Unfortunately, it's not currently available, which is likely part of the reason why it wasn't talked about during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">The Android Show</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">Google I/O Keynote</a>.</p><h2 id="desktop-mode-feels-like-an-afterthought-for-good-reason-2">Desktop mode feels like an afterthought (for good reason)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1926px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="icupX67vGa4L6VfSMCTdhN" name="android-16-desktop-mode-google-io-2025-developer-keynote" alt="Desktop mode on Android 16 during Google I/O 2025 Developer Keynote" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/icupX67vGa4L6VfSMCTdhN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1926" height="1083" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is a dedicated session for "desktop windowing," but besides that, the feature was only briefly mentioned during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/GjvgtwSOCao?si=lF-Hjy-_0oGm-1QG&t=1248" target="_blank">I/O 2025 Developer Keynote</a>. Behind the two presenters, a demo played, showing an app window being resized in desktop mode.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if desktop mode was an afterthought, at which point Google tapped Samsung for help. I have to imagine that Google was trying to figure out ways to get developers on board with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/i-tried-a-google-built-in-car-and-its-a-sneak-peek-at-gemini-on-android-auto">Android Auto</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>. Then, someone probably said, "Why not throw Android users a bone and properly add Desktop Mode?"</p><p>A more likely reason is that desktop mode on Android is essentially the same functionality as what we expect from the other platforms. Obviously, it won't be exactly the same, but the "<em>foundation</em>" is fundamentally unchanged. This means resizable app windows that can be placed anywhere on the screen, without compromising the overall experience.</p><h2 id="inspired-by-classic-dex-2">Inspired by Classic DeX</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2212px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eULcxH8wHBQUFB4sTqvdpK" name="samsung-new-dex-settings.jpg" alt=""New DeX" Settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eULcxH8wHBQUFB4sTqvdpK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2212" height="1244" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I made it this far before remembering something: Samsung added a "New DeX" mode with One UI 6.0 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. As I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default" target="_blank">wrote last year</a>, it "feels like a super-charged version of what you get out of the box," referring to the traditional home screen layout. Instead of going to a desktop interface, everything stays the same, with the exception of apps opening in resizable windows instead of taking up the entire screen.</p><p>It's essentially blending DeX and One UI together, embracing the tablet layout but with the ability to show more than two or three apps at once. However, based on what we've seen so far, it doesn't seem like Google's version will be adopting the "New DeX" take, and instead will stick with the "Classic DeX" inspiration.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5283px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="2Jy7ERbiX5RcbZ7Fw77hXT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-dex-mode-ultrawide-monitor.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 in DeX mode connected to ultrawide monitor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Jy7ERbiX5RcbZ7Fw77hXT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5283" height="2972" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Frankly, I'm thankful for this, as the New DeX wasn't without its limitations. The biggest of which, for me at least, is that when plugging in an external monitor, the only option is to mirror the screen.</p><p>As someone who uses a 49-inch ultrawide along with a 27-inch vertical monitor, this was a deal-breaker. So I just stick to regular DeX mode most of the time, only occasionally using New DeX when I'm doing tablet things and not trying to get work done.</p><p>Of course, it's entirely possible that Google throws a curveball and gives us proper desktop mode, but doesn't allow for anything but screen mirroring with external displays. The reality is that we just don't know yet, but on the bright side, we should have the answers soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

McFly (OnLeaks), in collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-renders-360-video-5k-leaked/">Sammy Guru</a>, revealed alleged CAD renders of the wearable earlier today.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So #FutureSquad...

The publication further states that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will have a 450mAh battery capacity,  which is slightly more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-google-pixel-watch-2">Galaxy Watch 7</a>'s battery (425 mAh).</p><p>There have been speculations that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic could be the successor of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> or Pro line of watches, due to the wearable's more rugged and squared-off design in previous leaks.</p><p>That said, there have been various rumors suggesting this watch could come with a physical rotating bezel, which was last seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>. Sammy Guru also solidifies these claims by stating that" it really seems like the rotating bezel is making a return."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kc93PvsHI_8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>As for the other specs, Sammy Guru says that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will feature a roughly 1.5-inch display, with dimensions roughly measuring 46 x 46.5 x 14.2mm.</p><p>The renders depict the watch in black, showcasing a squircle outer frame like the Galaxy Watch Ultra. A silver rotating bezel encircles the dial. The image also reveals two buttons on one side, flanking a smaller orange button.</p><p>Additionally, the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic was spotted passing through the Bluetooth SIG database for certification in April, attached to an SM-L505U model number.</p><p>Of course, it's important to note that the leaks should be taken with a grain of salt, but the leaker has a pretty good track record.

One section in particular caught our eye, and that was a brief section about Google's Health Connect. According to the company, Health Connect is expanding its "sharing data" function, which spreads your health information across multiple apps.</p><p>Starting in June, Google says Health Connect will pick up Runna, Mi Fitness, and Garmin.</p><p>Google touted how much user activity has grown in Health Connect over the past six months. Its data states there's been a 50% increase in "Active User Growth" and "adoption is flourishing." Flo was also mentioned to join the fray in Health Connect. The company then showed what was coming to Health Connect, like its new Medical Records API.</p><p>In short, this will let users "consolidate health data." In more detail, Google says users will be able to "read and write things" such as their allergies and immunizations to "enable richer experiences." Google adds that this will help your apps stay informed about you while also providing users with better everyday "medical context."</p><h2 id="health-focused-2">Health-focused</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2nlRNf9_VE0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Health Connect support for Garmin will give its consumers a little more to work with when using their latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">Fenix 8 and Enduro 3</a> smartwatches. This pair launched in August 2024 with AMOLED displays and a wide selection of sizes. Garmin also focused on the battery life aspect of its latest watches, granting the Enduro 3 90 days on a single full charge. The 47mm Fenix 8 Solar climbs to 29 days.</p><p>These watches, alongside a few more, picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/heres-everything-garmin-added-to-its-smartwatches-in-the-december-2024-update">a huge update</a> in December that brought five new features to users. The Fenix 8 and Enduro 3 received every feature: lactate threshold, FTP auto-detection, Garmin Coach strength training plans, workout execution score updates, and meditation activity.</p><p>What's more, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">medical team</a> has been focusing on improving the effectiveness of its wearable health. While Google has a lot planned for cardiovascular health and sleep, Health Connect was mentioned briefly. The company wants Health Connect to absorb more data from the likes of Fitbit and Samsung Health. Essentially, it would be better used to feed its machine-learning algorithm to achieve better, accurate results for users, rather than "waiting for smartwatches to start tracking."</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This interface has received a much-needed facelift, and Google absolutely nailed it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2165px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.96%;"><img id="xS7C4PZj7SJsdFSVpDKyR9" name="android-16-qpr1-beta-1-bugs-1" alt="Software bugs in Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xS7C4PZj7SJsdFSVpDKyR9.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="2165" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It didn't take long to be reminded that I was using beta software, as I've already encountered a couple of bugs.</p><p>The first is that I seem to be missing a couple of the Home Screen layout options. I can only choose either "Small" or "Medium," but I am apparently missing "Large" and "XL." The other bug that I found was when I was trying to pick a wallpaper from a Google Photos album.</p><p>Several times, I would pick a wallpaper and decide against it only after seeing the preview. And while it technically took me to the previous page, the Photo Picker and "Wallpaper" screens would get combined. Instead of messing around with it more, I just ended up going into the Photos app and setting the wallpaper from there.</p><h2 id="no-desktop-mode-yet-but-there-s-something-else-2">No Desktop Mode (yet), but there's something else</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xbrBEuPwP6RdkBtdUXNfmF" name="android-16-qpr-beta-1-multi-tasking-menu-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="New multi-tasking context menu in Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbrBEuPwP6RdkBtdUXNfmF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next, I jumped into the Settings app, as one does, to try and see if Desktop Mode was available. However, I was immediately thrown off by the colorful icons that now appear alongside each of the primary settings pages. No, it's not a big deal, but it was unexpected and something else I would rather enjoy.</p><p>Unfortunately, my hopes for Desktop Mode with QPR1 Beta 1 were dashed. After double-checking the Developer Options and coming up empty, I decided to just plug the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> into an external monitor. Sadly, all I had was the option to mirror the screen, which is the same behavior as previous Android builds.</p><p>While disappointing, another surprise greeted me when I opened the app switcher. Each app has its own label in the top left corner of the preview window, but when you tap that, you're presented with a drop-down context menu.</p><div><blockquote><p>I was disappointed with the lack of a default Desktop Mode, but it didn't take long to move on and find something else new.</p></blockquote></div><p>From here, you have a few options, such as using it in split screen mode, taking a screenshot, or selecting objects and text to copy, share, save, or look up with Google Lens. It's yet again, another one of those changes that I didn't expect, but am happy to see.</p><h2 id="more-surprises-2">More surprises</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DBpTh8fifHXNyQzbx6AePW" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-5" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DBpTh8fifHXNyQzbx6AePW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I spent a little while longer diving through menus and seeing what looked different, what was new.

Android Central managing editor Derrek Lee informed me that the Tiles are resizable, so you can have four toggles in a row instead of just two. That's something he's very excited about.</p><p>I did try to see if it would let me adjust the size of one toggle so it would span an entire row, but no dice. Seeing as this is just Beta 1, maybe Google will make that possible with a future update.</p><h2 id="unexpected-feelings-2">Unexpected feelings</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FgLGN6ffKxpzHiEBeJY7qF" name="android-16-qpr-beta-1-home-screen-pixel-9-pro-fold-2" alt="Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 home screen on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgLGN6ffKxpzHiEBeJY7qF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whenever a company releases a new software version, most of the time, I just keep an eye out for any feature additions or changes.

Metric/statistical accuracy is incredibly important when it comes to understanding your fitness, and that's where things begin.</p><p>In the app, Oura states your step counts should be more accurate. The company says the app will forgo estimating your steps through "generic movements." Instead, the Oura app will more closely mirror the behavior of a pedometer, as well as machine learning for a more realistic step count. So, be ready to grab your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Oura Ring 4</a> and get moving.</p><p>Moreover, Oura is improving the accuracy of Active Calories Burned, thanks to better heart rate monitoring. To be specific, Oura states the app's display of how many calories you've burned will factor in the intensity of your heartbeat. This will particularly come into play during exercises.</p><p>These features are rolling out to members globally.</p><h2 id="metrics-activities-more-2">Metrics, Activities, & More</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="erQnFnJPhAFcEG9FxL3Fuf" name="oura-activity-ring-example" alt="Models wearing the Oura Ring holding a tennis ball." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/erQnFnJPhAFcEG9FxL3Fuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="480" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a few smaller refinements for the Oura app's behavior, like All-Day activity tracking. The post says users will now see more insightful data regarding their movements and activities throughout the entire day (including things done between 12 am and 4 am). Additionally, if something isn't right, users can add/edit activities in the Oura app and the program will "automatically adjust" older Readiness and Activity Scores.</p><p>Oura details the inclusion of your heart rate from partner apps like Google Health Connect and HealthKit.</p><p>Speaking of automatic detection, Oura is adding more movement data, like running splits, via its updated fitness metrics. The company highlights the app's new ability to show more detailed run and walk information.</p><p>Active Minutes picks up a new Trend view, which will hopefully give users a more insightful overview of their daily, weekly, and monthly activities. Oura's updated fitness metrics and Trend view will arrive "later this summer" on Android. The other features, All-Day Activities, improved automatic activity detection, heart rate from partners integration, and add/edit activities are available today (May 21) for all users.</p><h2 id="more-partners-2">More Partners</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3895px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-12.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3895" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Oura is incorporating your heart rate from partners like Google and HealthKit, there's more in store that expands your horizons.</p><p>The company states the Oura app will also integrate statics about you with other apps like CorePower Yoga. Starting May 21, Oura members will be able to see their sleep, heart rate, stress and Readiness data <em>inside </em>the CorePower Yoga app. Moreover, those using the yoga app and Oura will find a 15 percent off an All-Access CorePower membership once this rolls out.</p><p>Oura app will also integrate with The Sculpt Society on May 21, too. The Readiness score from Oura will hop over, giving users tailor-made workout suggestions based on your energy levels. Also, to celebrate, Oura members will receive  50 percent off their first two months of the TSS app using the code “OURA” at checkout.</p><p>Tomorrow packs even more as Oura says it's analytics will hop over into Open. The Open app will provide users with "personalized" recovery rituals based on your Sleep Score. Lastly, Technogym will be able to utilize your HRV, resting heart rate, and sleep patterns from the Oura app. These stats will work into Technogym's Wellness Passport.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are demos, hands-on experiences, Q&A sessions, and more happening at Shoreline Amphitheatre near Google's Mountain View headquarters.</p><p>We've recapped the Google I/O 2025 keynote, and given you hands-on scoops about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Android XR glasses</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/i-tried-a-google-built-in-car-and-its-a-sneak-peek-at-gemini-on-android-auto">Android Auto</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">Project Moohan</a>.

The company says that its Gemini Robotics division "teaches robots to grasp, follow instructions and adjust on the fly." I got to try out Gemini Robotics myself, using voice commands to direct two robot arms and move object hands-free.</p><p>The demo is using a Gemini model, a camera, and two robot arms to move things around. The multimodal capabilities — like a live camera feed and microphone input — make it easy to control Gemini robots with simple instructions. In one instance, I asked the robot to move the yellow brick, and the arm did exactly that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pTBau6dHeimWXB6WL5CRYL" name="Gemini-Robot-2" alt="Gemini's robot arms picking up a gift bag." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pTBau6dHeimWXB6WL5CRYL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It felt responsive, although there were some limitations. In one instance, I tried to tell Gemini to move the yellow piece where it was before, and quickly learned that this version of the AI model doesn't have a memory. But considering Gemini Robotics is still an experiment, that isn't exactly surprising.</p><p>I wish Google would've focused a bit more on these applications during the keynote. Gemini Robotics is <em>exactly</em> the kind of AI we should want. There's no need for AI to replace human creativity, like art or music, but there's an abundance of potential for Gemini Robotics to eliminate the mundane work in our lives.</p><h2 id="trying-on-clothes-using-shop-with-ai-mode-2">Trying on clothes using Shop with AI Mode</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="x5QE9QgL3EHNMzuvLRkmt5" name="Google-IO-Shopping-Try-On-1" alt="The demo booth at Google I/O for Shop with AI Mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x5QE9QgL3EHNMzuvLRkmt5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who refuses to try on clothes in dressing rooms — and hates returning clothes from online stores that don't fit as expected just as much — I was skeptical but excited by Google's announcement of Shop with AI Mode. It uses a custom image generation model that understands "how different materials fold and stretch according to different bodies."</p><p>In other words, it should give you an accurate representation of how clothes will look on you, rather than just superimposing an outfit with augmented reality (AR). I'm a glasses-wearer that frequently tries on glasses virtually using AR, hopeful that it'll give me an idea of how they'll look on my face, only to be disappointed by the result.</p><p>I'm happy to report that Shop with AI Mode's virtual try-on experience is nothing like that. It quickly takes a full-length photo of yourself and uses generative AI to add an outfit in a way that looks shockingly realistic. In the gallery below, you can see each part of the process — the finished result, the marketing photo for the outfit, and the original picture of me used for the edit.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YfjjAjBupFnyrSKs4yEyZJ" name="Google-IO-Shopping-Try-On-2" alt="The process of trying on clothes with Shop with AI Mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfjjAjBupFnyrSKs4yEyZJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">I'm wearing a virtual suit using Shop with AI Mode. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RohZt9S6rxKtw6TXhvuiLJ" name="Google-IO-Shopping-Try-On-3" alt="The process of trying on clothes with Shop with AI Mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohZt9S6rxKtw6TXhvuiLJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">This is the marketing photo for the suit that Shop with AI Mode helped me digitally try on.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N2AkFptCk7hDNTDBmfE9dJ" name="Google-IO-Shopping-Try-On-4" alt="The process of trying on clothes with Shop with AI Mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2AkFptCk7hDNTDBmfE9dJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">This is the photo Google used to help me try on clothes with Shop with AI Mode. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Is it going to be perfect?

There's no better example of that than Androidify, a tool that turns a photo of yourself into an Android Bot. To get the result you see below, a complex Android app flow used AI and image processing.

Then, it analyses the image and generates a text description of it using the Firebase AI Logic SDK. From there, that description is sent to a custom Imagen model optimized specifically for creating Android Bots. Finally, the image is generated.</p><p>That's a bunch of AI processing to get from a real-life photo to a custom Android Bot. It's a neat preview of how developers can use tools like Imagen to offer new features, and the good news is that Androidify is open-source.

For those unfamiliar, Lyria Realtime "leverages generative AI to produce a continuous stream of music controlled by user actions." The idea is that developers can incorporate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-watermarks-for-ai-generated-music">Lyria</a> into their apps using an API to add soundtracks to their apps.</p><p>At the demo station, I tried a lifelike representation of the Lyria API in action. There were three music control knobs, only they were as big as chairs. You could sit down and spin the dial to adjust the percentage of impact each genre had on the sound created. As you change the genres and their prominence, the audio playing changed in real time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dJzVPRcsSKeDWYGfNuv2Ze" name="Google-IO-Lyria-2" alt="Setting the Orchestral genre to 50% at a Google I/O demo of Lyria 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dJzVPRcsSKeDWYGfNuv2Ze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cool part about Lyria Realtime is that, as the name suggests, there's no delay.

Compared to basic video generators, Flow is used to enable creators to have consistent and seamless themes and styles across clips. After creating a clip, you can change the video's characteristics as "ingredients," and use that as prompting material to keep generating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6k3HbZGnbRUQCPcoykq6Ch" name="Google-IO-Flow-Veo-2" alt="Creating custom video clips with Flow and Veo 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6k3HbZGnbRUQCPcoykq6Ch.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I gave <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-2-video-generator-gemini-advanced-whisk-rollout">Veo 2</a> (I couldn't try Veo 3 because it takes longer to generate) a challenging prompt: "generate a video of a Mets player hitting a home run in comic style." In some ways, it missed the mark — one of my videos had a player with two heads and none of them actually showed a home run being hit. But setting Veo's struggles aside, it was clear that Flow is a useful tool.</p><p>The ability to edit, splice, and add to AI-generated videos is nothing short of a breakthrough for Google. The very nature of AI generation is that every creation is unique, and that's a bad thing if you're a storyteller using multiple clips to create a cohesive work. With Flow, Google seems to have solved that problem.</p><hr><p>If you found AI talk during the main keynote boring, I don't blame you. The word Gemini was spoken 95 times and AI was uttered slightly fewer on 92 occasions. The cool thing about AI isn't <em>what</em> it can do, but <em>how</em> it can change the way you complete tasks and interact with your devices. So far, the demo experiences at Google I/O 2025 did a solid job at showing the <em>how</em> to attendees at the event.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, Deep Think, Google's new reasoning mode, which is said to nudge Google's AI into "considering multiple hypotheses" before delivering its response, is currently being tested.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1617px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4iBY7BnxMFGjbpH6vixPBD" name="gemini-2-5-flash-google-io-2025" alt="Google Gemini 2.5 Flash availability" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4iBY7BnxMFGjbpH6vixPBD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1617" height="910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tulsee Doshi, senior director & product lead, Gemini Models at Google DeepMind, demoed this new Gemini Model's text-to-speech capabilities. She added that it will work in 24 languages, and can switch between languages (and switch back) "all with the same voice."</p><p>Doshi also showed us how Gemini Diffusion generates codes five times faster than Google's lightest 2.5 model— analyzing the prompt in the blink of an eye (quite literally).

Google announced today at I/O that it will be integrating a custom version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a>'s 2.5 model into Search for both AI Mode and AI Overviews.</p><p>This means that users can start asking Gemini more complex queries tailored to their needs. Google also states that AI Mode will be the sole platform to get a front-seat access to all the new AI-powered features that will be rolled out starting this week.</p><p><strong>Google Search gets Project Astra:</strong></p><p>Google announced today that it's pushing the limits of live, real-time search and bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">Project Astra</a>'s multimodal capabilities to Google Search. You can talk back and forth with Gemini about what you're looking at through your device's camera.</p><p>For example, if you're feeling stumped on a project and need some help, simply tap the "Live" icon in Al Mode or in Lens, point your camera, and ask your question. "Just like that, Search becomes a learning partner that can see what you see — explaining tricky concepts and offering suggestions along the way, as well as links to different resources that you can explore — like websites, videos, forums, and more," Google added.</p><p>Gemini Live camera and screen sharing is coming to both Android and iOS starting today.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-4" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>AI Mode gains more features</strong></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">AI Mode</a> is set to get a new Deep Search feature, which will give users a more thorough and thought-out response to their queries. This is particularly handy when users have to look up multiple websites while writing a research paper or simply want to gain knowledge about a certain topic.</p><p>Google stated in its press release that Deep Search collates data from "hundreds of websites," and it has the power to connect and draw conclusions from information that comes from different, unrelated sources or contexts to give users an "expert-level fully-cited report.

It can "understand" and process all the elements in a website, from images, text, code, and even pixels.</p><p>Google says that AI Mode will be integrated with these capabilities, which will help save users' time. For instance, you can ask AI Mode to find you two tickets for a soccer game on Saturday, with your preferred seats, and it will present you with multiple websites that match your exact needs.</p><p>For instance, you can ask AI mode to look up "things to go in Toronto this weekend with friends who are Harry Potter fans and big foodies."</p><p>AI Mode may show you results of Harry Potter-themed cafes or parties that you can go to, with hotel recommendations, tickets, and more.

It understands that you're looking for visual inspiration, and so it will show you a browsable panel of photos and product listings personalized to your tastes.</p><p>Users can even try out outfits virtually with the "try on" option. All you need to do is just upload a clear single picture, and AI Mode will show you images of what you'd look like in the attire you're shopping for.

Everyone can try Imagen 4 today in the Gemini app, while Veo 3  is available today in the Gemini app only for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yqg0oUaofH0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><strong>Flow</strong></p><p>If you thought that was all that Google could offer with image and video generation, then you've got to look at what their new "Flow" has to offer. It basically does the job of a script writer, a cinematographer, and an editor. Flow basically is built to help storytellers turn big ideas into movie scenes without spending the money to make one!</p><p>With Flow, you just type something like "A detective chases a thief through a rainy Tokyo alley," and Veo 3 brings it to life, complete with footsteps, rain sounds, and cinematic lighting.</p><p>You can tweak camera angles, zoom in, or switch perspectives like you're behind the lens. Building scenes becomes a breeze—add shots, change angles, remix elements, and it all stays consistent, like the one you see below.</p><p>At present, Flow is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra users in the U.S., with more countries getting access soon.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4zqVrLI8a0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><hr><h2 id="google-beam-2">Google Beam</h2><p>Google announced a new video conferencing platform at I/O 2025, called Google Beam.</p><p>It is built to transform regular 2D video calls into more realistic 3D experiences. Essentially, what this means is that the platform will use the AI tech and special light field displays, multiple cameras, as seen in Project Starline, to build a live, detailed, 3D digital copy for the user.</p><p>That copy is then displayed to the person on the other side, using the same special light field display. This screen sends different light rays to each eye, creating the illusion of depth and volume without the need for special glasses or headsets. So Google Beam will make it seem like the 3D copy of the other person is actually "there" in the room with you.</p><p>"This is what allows you to make eye contact, read subtle cues, and build understanding and trust, as if you were face to face," Google added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fTSMtiify22rJcv72t7W5R" name="google-io-ai-google-beam-02" alt="Google Beam at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fTSMtiify22rJcv72t7W5R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Along with Google Beam, the company is launching a real-time speech translation feature that allows people to speak freely, despite having language barriers.</p><p>For instance, if two people on a call speak different languages, such as French and English, each person can speak in their preferred language, and Google Beam will then translate the audio in real time.</p><p>It is expanding the real-time translation to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">Google Meet</a>, starting today.

The tech giant is calling the subscription Google AI Ultra, "a new AI subscription plan with the highest usage limits and access to our most capable models and premium features."</p><p>This plan is best suited for filmmakers, developers, creative professionals, or someone who wants to make the most out of  Google AI with the highest level of access. Google AI Ultra is available today in the U.S. for $250 a month (with a special offer for first-time users of 50% off for three months), and is coming soon to more countries.</p><p>That said, Google is renaming its premium AI plan to Google AI Pro. Priced at $20 a month, this plan gives users access to premium features as well. It includes access to the Gemini app with powerful models like 2.5 Pro and Veo 2 for video generation, alongside AI integration directly within Google apps such as Gmail, Docs, and Vids aimed at writing or proofreading.</p><p>Google says that subscribers also gain increased usage limits and premium features for NotebookLM, an AI research and writing assistant, and can generate and animate images with Whisk.</p><hr><h2 id="drum-roll-please-it-s-android-xr-time-2">Drum roll please..... It's Android XR time!</h2><p>You can be angry at me for holding onto the best for the last, but that's what Google did at I/O this year as well.</p><p>Google started off the Android XR chat by laying out its plans for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a>-powered smart glasses and AR glasses. It also touched on Project Moohan, Samsung's XR headset that is going to be powered by Gemini, stating that it will launch later this year.</p><p>That said, Google didn't officially confirm a name for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-xr">Android XR</a> glasses, and all the demos they showed during I/O did have a "prototype" label on it.

And as basic as it may sound, I really <em>enjoyed</em> using it.</p><p>Samsung revealed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan headset</a> back in 2024, but only gave out demos to a couple of sites and YouTubers.</p><p>We knew what it looked like and what kind of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> software to expect, but not whether it would live up to Samsung and Google's promises. We don't even know what Moohan — "Infinity" in Korean — will cost or officially be called.</p><p>But as much as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google's AR glasses prototype</a> intrigued me as proof that AR glasses can <em>work</em>, Samsung's XR headset felt like a proper next-gen device, with seamless hand-tracking controls and useful Gemini navigation.</p><h2 id="what-it-s-like-using-project-moohan-2">What it's like using Project Moohan</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rpaxx2rzkckHjxfePZXVEf" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-4" alt="Michael Hicks testing Android XR on Samsung Project Moohan at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpaxx2rzkckHjxfePZXVEf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A Google rep borrowed my glasses to check my prescription, then printed some lens inserts and snapped them into my Moohan headset. Then they set me up outdoors next to the AR glasses booth and had me slide on the headset.</p><p>I couldn't tell you the exact weight, but the headset felt well-balanced and securely strapped onto my head, thanks to the back knob.</p><p>I then had to slide a power brick into my pocket, with its cord attached to the left of the headset. It's on the heavy side, but it's not something you'll notice once you become immersed, and at least it isn't tethered to a PC or console in a fixed spot; you can walk anywhere with the headset.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qfNMCReBpfL3vqwVLooUse" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-3" alt="Michael Hicks testing Android XR on Samsung Project Moohan at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfNMCReBpfL3vqwVLooUse.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3024" height="1701" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The bottom gray portion under the lenses is removeable, depending on whether you want immersion or peripheral vision. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I then progressed through a brief onboarding tutorial. You pinch to select objects both near, grabbing the edge to move a window or the corner to resize it. And you point your palm toward yourself and pinch to pull up the home menu.</p><p>As a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> owner who's used an Apple Vision Pro, I found the controls completely intuitive and familiar, and I barely had any missed inputs during my demo. My virtual hand outline felt accurate and responsive to my real hand position.</p><p>Plus, the full-color camera was both vibrant and clear. The headset defaulted to mixed-reality passthrough, and I could see the journalists in line behind me taking photos of me as I tested out features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="896dSDKEeTg7HDMsNVJvYg" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-MWC-2025-2" alt="Samsung Project Moohan on display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/896dSDKEeTg7HDMsNVJvYg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung hasn't revealed Moohan's resolution, but the current rumor is that the headset uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">Sony 4K micro-OLED displays</a> with 3,552 × 3,840 resolution, 1,000-nit brightness at 20% power, 96% DCI-P3 color gamut, and 90 FPS.</p><p>Based on my visual experience, it's exactly as pixel-dense and colorful as you'd hope for. Some apps (like Maps Street View) can't live up to the resolution potential and appear a bit blurry, but when I watched 4K nature videos on YouTube, I could sink into the landscapes.</p><p>I also watched an immersive 180° video and a normal 2D video enhanced with AI to add 3D depth to certain portions of the video. While Moohan's hardware is impressive, I wouldn't be as excited for the headset if it weren't for unique Android XR tricks like this.</p><h2 id="natural-gemini-navigation-2">Natural Gemini navigation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I obviously can't show you what I saw in-headset, but the screenshots above and below felt like a fairly accurate representation of my experience.</p><p>By default, opening any app will bring it front and center as a 2D window. But when I hit the "expand" button in YouTube, it curved the display for a more traditional theater look and added secondary windows on either side with video info, a playlist scroll, and more.</p><p>Mostly, though, Samsung and Google are expecting you to let <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> do the work of opening and navigating through apps for you.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nxuFMJF3BJrHA62DcyLxTf" name="Android-XR-circle-to-search-chrome" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating Chrome screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room.

Turned out it was the famous El Capitan, a 3,000-foot-tall granite formation. Gemini asked if I wanted to know more about its geology or its climbing history; I asked how many people had climbed it, and Gemini flattered me by saying it was a "great question."</p><p>While Gemini on glasses has to pass your questions off to your phone, Gemini on Samsung's headset processes on-device and feels much more responsive as a result. Gemini still has to stall sometimes by saying, "Let me figure that out for you," but that's probably better than an awkward silence where you don't know if Gemini heard you or not.</p><h2 id="only-moohan-s-price-has-me-worried-2">Only Moohan's price has me worried</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9SXVsWtmbfJkmHXMKFq5ve" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-2" alt="Michael Hicks testing Android XR on Samsung Project Moohan at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9SXVsWtmbfJkmHXMKFq5ve.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3024" height="1701" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">That's my "Wow, not bad!" face, apparently </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung will officially launch Project Moohan later in 2025, giving developers a few more months to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-glasses-coming-designed-by-gentle-monster-warby-parker">new developer preview</a> to make XR apps for the headset.</p><p>But this is a premium productivity headset with powerful performance and gorgeous resolution, just like the Apple Vision Pro. I'm sure Samsung will try to undercut Apple's $3,500 price, but I'd guess it'll still cost <em>much</em> more than a Quest.</p><p>Most of my experience with Moohan focused on <em>casual</em> features, like you'd use while slacking off from work. But I can't judge from a 15-minute demo whether I'd want to use this as a laptop display (or replacement) for hours every day. That's a much higher bar to clear, and it makes Moohan more niche.</p><p>That being said, if (A) I can afford Samsung Project Moohan, (B) it pairs well with Bluetooth keyboards and mice for work, and (C) it ends up having a decent selection of VR games and streaming apps, then I'd absolutely buy and use Moohan on a regular basis.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The M3 Expressive places the most prominent action icons right where you can see them instead of hiding behind menus.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JSkW5NpMNvEa5mag4n4ivc" name="Material-3-Expressive" alt="Pixel devices get the new Android 16 QPR1 update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JSkW5NpMNvEa5mag4n4ivc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DJynj9mmYqjFs47CyFumvc" name="Material-3-Expressive" alt="Pixel devices get the new Android 16 QPRS1 update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DJynj9mmYqjFs47CyFumvc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KmnxnpdNicYYoTtG4wXNwc" name="Material-3-Expressive" alt="Pixel devices get the new Android 16 QPRS1 update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmnxnpdNicYYoTtG4wXNwc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The notification shade is the most playful part of the UI yet.

I'm sure they'd slide down my nose from the weight if not properly fitted, and it's hard to judge weight fatigue in a quick demo period, but in theory, I could see myself wearing them all day without complaint. And that's <em>really</em> important for AR glasses to pull off, as much as performance and battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1591px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gA49nNS822vdTmiBHxxBBV" name="gentle-monster-warby-parker-partnerships-android-xr" alt="Android XR partners Gentle Monster and Warby Parker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gA49nNS822vdTmiBHxxBBV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1591" height="895" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm excited to see Gentle Monster and Warby Parker take their shot at Android XR glasses, and hypothetically see Google AR and smart glasses available in regular eyewear stores in the future.</p><p>Overall, I don't want to read too much into a brief, carefully curated demo. I'm sure a few days with these glasses would show more pain points, such as battery life.

At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-i-o-2025-live-blog">Google I/O 2025</a>, the company previewed upcoming features set to arrive on cars with Android Auto. I got to try a pre-release version of Gemini in a Volvo car with Google built-in and a Genesis car with Android Auto — and came away awfully impressed.</p><p>There are two separate experiences heading to cars in the future, and the one you get will depend on whether your car supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-make-car-rides-more-fun-with-new-entertainment-and-navigation-apps">Google built-in</a> or Android Auto. For perspective, there are 250 million cars that work with<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review"> Android Auto</a>, but only 50 car models that work with Google built-in. The latter models include brand names like Chevrolet, Volvo, GMC, Ford, and Honda, but there simply aren't as many Google built-in (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-automotive-15-features-detailed">Android Automotive</a>) cars out on the road today.</p><p>The good news is that most of the enticing Google features coming to cars will work regardless of whether your car supports Google built-in or not. Crucial features like hands-free Gemini help for navigation, basic questions, media control, and natural conversation are available to both Android Auto and Google built-in users.</p><h2 id="google-built-in-makes-your-phone-optional-2">Google built-in makes your phone optional</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SwQDPkHvqZDavRst9BCN83" name="Android-Automotive-Demo-5" alt="Gemini on a car with Google Built-in a.k.a.

Essentially, your car's infotainment and climate control features become one with Android Auto. That unlocks new possibilities, like the ability to turn up the air-conditioning or disable defrost mode with your voice by asking Gemini.</p><p>If you have a fairly modern car, you might be thinking that you've used voice control before, so what's new about using Gemini on cars with Google built-in? The key advantage to using Gemini for voice control is that it can understand your commands in natural language. Previously, you might have had to memorize a specific keyword or phrase to get your car's infotainment system to successfully make changes based on your voice commands.</p><p>By comparison, Gemini can make changes on your behalf even when you use confusing phrases or say the wrong thing. In situations where you might get confused and stumble over your words, Gemini should be able to still uncover what you're trying to say. If you say something like, "Gemini, turn on the defroster," it'll complete the action without the driver needing to reach for a physical control or the touchscreen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JbGq8yiMyeXJBn6r8kthQ" name="Android-Automotive-Demo-7" alt="Gemini on a car with Google Built-in a.k.a.

Google says that developers don't have to specifically design their apps for Android Auto — cars with Google built-in can run thousands of apps already on the Play Store.</p><p>Additionally, the company is working with select brands, like Volvo, to integrate car manuals with Gemini. When asked about a specific light that flicked on in the Volvo demo car I tried, Gemini was able to read straight from the manual and explain that it wasn't something to be concerned about.</p><p>Lastly, due to the nature of cars with Google built-in, Google tells us that Gemini will include some offline capabilities on these vehicles, "and it will have a hybrid architecture, where those things will rely on on-device computing."</p><p>"At some point, a lot of the car makers are actively working to upgrade their hardware, and as you get that more powerful compute capabilities, Gemini will also take advantage of all of that."</p><h2 id="the-gemini-experience-is-coming-to-all-cars-with-android-auto-2">The Gemini experience is coming to all cars with Android Auto</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="22wnjFUv4Jcw2vL2r3ZjPA" name="Gemini-Side-Interface-Android-Auto" alt="Gemini floating interface on Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/22wnjFUv4Jcw2vL2r3ZjPA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from novelty features like car manuals and climate controls, the vast majority of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini features</a> are available on <em>both</em> cars with Google built-in and those that only support Android Auto (aside from offline capabilities). Specifically, Gemini on Android Auto is going to make it easier for drivers to plan trips without manually tapping on their smartphone. You can ask Gemini to start <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps navigation</a> to a destination, and that's just the start.</p><p>From there, you can ask Gemini to find stops for a particular place along the way, or tell it to suggest a few options. It supports follow-up questions, like what time the second restaurant on the list closes. As someone who always makes sure to check a place's operating hours before I put my car in drive, having Gemini do that for me would be a serious convenience boost.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4oTzHXaHGG4hWwCbg9YYKA" name="Android-Auto-Gemini-Messages" alt="Sending a message using Gemini on Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4oTzHXaHGG4hWwCbg9YYKA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Effectively, Gemini on Android Auto is like a supercharged version of the older Assistant experience. It's smarter and can do things like remember to always text a person in your contacts in Spanish, as Google explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/gemini-for-cars/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>But for me, the killer experience is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">Gemini Live</a> on Android Auto. It might sound strange to speak to an AI assistant on your drive, but there are a few reasons I think it's going to be the most impactful Android Auto upgrade yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9" name="Android-Auto-Gemini-Live" alt="Gemini Live and Google Maps on Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are about a million situations where I feel like Gemini Live on Android Auto is going to make a lot of sense. Need to prepare for an important meeting or a job interview? Gemini Live can help you prep. Studying for an important test, or maybe something huge like the LSATs? Gemini Live turns a monotonous commute into a study session. That extra few minutes of conversation might help ease your nerves or give you the last bit of preparation you need to ace that test or secure that job.</p><p>The possibilities feel endless. You can see something on the road and ask Gemini Live about it, or simply ask the AI to keep you awake with conversation on a long road trip. Driving is a time-sucker for a lot of us, and having Gemini Live on Android Auto to talk with could be an easy way to better utilize it.</p><h2 id="when-is-gemini-coming-to-your-car-2">When is Gemini coming to your car?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fWsi9AMU4mEQrxYD7Qdz2B" name="Android-Auto-Car-Genesis" alt="Genesis car with Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fWsi9AMU4mEQrxYD7Qdz2B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A production Genesis car with pre-release Android Auto software and Gemini that I tested at Google I/O.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Auto users will get Gemini integration first, as it's arriving in an update "in the coming months." Meanwhile, the Google built-in experience is said to be coming "later this year." Nearly all of Gemini's best features are set to come to all the 250 million cars that support Android Auto.</p><p>Although the version of Gemini with Google built-in was pre-release and had a few bugs, the entire experience felt positive. Gemini seemed to be a much more reliable voice assistant than even Google Assistant, which has seen numerous feature deprecations and reliability concerns of late. Between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show">the Gemini support and a fresh user-interface</a>, the future of Android Auto looks bright.</p><p><strong>Update (May 21, 12:15 p.m. ET): </strong>Added photos of the Android Auto demo.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">S25 Edge</a> puts design over everything else making it the slimmest and lightest flagship from Samsung yet. Certain cuts to the cameras and battery have had to be made to achieve this, but if all you care about is having the lightest phone, it doesn't get much better than this.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> looks fat and heavy in comparison but in its own right, it's still slimmer and lighter than most other flagships. It's also a bit cheaper and packs a few more features than the Edge. If you're stuck deciding between which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phone</a> to choose, here's a breakdown of all the main differences and similarities, so you can make the right choice.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Plus: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-8" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From the front, both phones look pretty similar since they have the same display size of 6.7 inches. If you look closer though, the Galaxy S25 Plus has a slightly softer curve for the four corners, compared to the sharper corners of the Galaxy S25 Edge. Both phones use Samsung's Armor Aluminum frame and scratch-resistant glass for the front and back. The S25 Edge gets the latest Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 for the display and Victus 2 on the back, whereas the S25 Plus uses Victus 2 on both sides.</p><p>The layout of the rear cameras is also different as the Galaxy S25 Plus has individual cutouts for the three lenses, while the S25 Edge gets a little island with two lenses similar to the 2025 Galaxy A series phones. Both phones are IP68 rated for dust and water resistance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4216px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="gNFSyPBLYGm4Aukm8hZPJW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-07" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus on a table at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gNFSyPBLYGm4Aukm8hZPJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4216" height="2372" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy S25 Plus have virtually identical display specs. The 6.7-inch screens have a Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel with a QHD+ resolution and adaptive refresh rate (1Hz-120Hz). Both have the same peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits and support HDR playback.</p><p>We've not got a chance to test the S25 Edge yet, but the S25 Plus' display performed really well in all lighting conditions. It managed to produce excellent colors, had great sunlight legibility, and everything looked crisp and sharp thanks to the high resolution and dense pixel count.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Plus: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge starts at $1,099.99 for 256GB of storage, but Samsung is offering the 512GB variant for the same price as part of its launch offers. Typically, the 512GB variant costs $1,219.99. The Galaxy S25 Plus starts at $999.99 for the same base storage as the Edge, while the 512GB variant costs $1,119.99. The latter is typically available closer to $1,000 on Amazon, even without sales.</p><p>What's common between the two is the SoC. Both phones are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, so performance should be more or less identical. We're yet to test the S25 Edge so we're not sure if Samsung has throttled the performance a bit in order to keep the chip running cool when stressed. That's something we will be keeping an eye on when we review it.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO, up to 2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO, up to 2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 12MP ultrawide; 12MP selfie</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10 telephoto (3x); 12MP selfie</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,900mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td><td  ><p>45W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>163g</p></td><td  ><p>190g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack</p></td><td  ><p>Icy Blue, Mint, Navy, Silver Shadow, <em>(Samsung.com exclusive: Pink Gold, Coral Red, Blue Black)</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus has a better selection of rear cameras compared to the S25 Edge. The third camera is a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, which should capture sharper photos than the Edge's digital zoom. Samsung has equipped the Edge with the 200MP main camera from the S25 Ultra, and this allows it to do 2x in-sensor zoom with seemingly no loss in image quality. The S25 Plus has a 50MP main camera which is still quite capable, even though it lacks in resolution. Both phones are capable of 8K video recording and shooting in HDR.</p><p>Battery life is another area where the S25 Plus has the clear upper hand thanks to the massive 4,900mAh capacity. It also supports 45W charging but the charger needs to be bought separately. The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 3,900mAh battery which is much smaller than the S25 Plus, and there's only 25W charging. Both phones have wireless charging rated at 15W.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus-software-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Plus: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSE67exCYcvrPz3FdhbdGM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-20" alt="Gemini on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSE67exCYcvrPz3FdhbdGM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy S25 Plus should have pretty much the same software features. Both phones run One UI 7 which is based on Android 15, and should be getting all future updates roughly around the same time. The S25 Plus and Edge will be getting seven years of OS upgrades and security patches. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> has a bunch of customization and useful AI features to play with.

It's simply the better phone thanks to the much larger battery and more versatile rear cameras. Compared to other flagship phones, it's actually on the slimmer and lighter side.</p><p>I don't see many people opting for the Galaxy S25 Edge over the S25 Plus, unless you must have the slimmest possible flagship. Samsung ideally should have done more in terms of design to make the Edge feel special, after all, it is a highly specialized phone. I'm still not sure what purpose it serves, other than maybe being a pre-emptive move against Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air.</p><p>To reiterate, get the Galaxy S25 Plus over the S25 Edge. You'll thank me later.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cf1746ff-7f40-413b-a4c6-6b84b6cbd9af">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QsN67o4CHF3kUwhW4KioyM.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus in Navy official render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The one to get</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus is the better phone compared to the S25 Edge.

Google states it wants to simplify daily, mundane tasks for users, turning longer browsing journeys into quick three-click sprints.</p><p>Earlier today, during I/O 2025, Google discussed what it wants out of Gemini, and that involves turning it into a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-vision-world-model-explained">World Model.</a>" To achieve this, Google is looking to incorporate the multitasking power of Project Mariner and the visualizing power of Project Astra into Gemini. More than that, they want Gemini's intelligence to be able to "simulate" and understand the world, so it can create plans for its users.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's essentially a mix of the Galaxy S25 Plus and Ultra but put in an extremely thin and light chassis. On its own, it's a great little flagship option for anyone looking for something super-thin and light. The problem is with its pricing. It starts at a little over $1,000, which is about $200 shy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>The Ultra is Samsung's hero product so anyone spending this sort of money on the S25 Edge really needs to think hard about one thing — wouldn't it make sense to spend a bit more and get a much better product? While the Galaxy S25 Edge doesn't really compete with the S25 Ultra directly, from a buyer's perspective, doing a comparative analysis is crucial in order to make the right decision.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-14" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most stark difference between the Galaxy S25 Edge and the S25 Ultra is the design. The Edge is ridiculously thin at just 5.8mm and extremely light at just 163 grams. The frame is Armor Aluminum and there's Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 over the display. The rear panel gets Gorilla Glass Victus. The corners of the S25 Edge have softer curves which actually feel nice to hold, based on our hour-long hands-on with the phone.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is boxier, heavier, and thicker than the S25 Edge. This is only amplified if you decide to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">use a case</a> on it. The Ultra can be a bit cumbersome to hold for long with one hand or carry around in a pocket, due to its weight and awkward size.  It's extremely well-built though and sturdy thanks to the titanium frame. Its display also gets a special anti-reflective treatment which the S25 Edge lacks.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-lock-screen" alt="View of the lock screen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both phones have extremely high-resolution displays that look absolutely fantastic. The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch LTPO Super AMOLED 2X panel, with a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 3,120x1,440 pixels. Incidentally, it has the same 2,600 nits of peak brightness as the S25 Ultra, so sunlight legibility should be on par. The bezels are extremely slim and the hole-punch for the front camera isn't distracting.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a larger 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED display but with the same resolution, which means the pixel count is lower. It's still well above 450 ppi so you won't really notice this even when viewing the same content on both phones side by side. The anti-reflective coating on the Ultra is a game-changer when viewing the display under sunlight or with artificial lighting behind you, and it's a shame that the Edge misses out on it.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge starts at $1,099.99 for 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, and the 512GB variant is priced at $1,219.99.

The S25 Ultra comes in four colors and this is not including the three exclusive shades that are only available through Samsung.com.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO, up to 2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO, up to 2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 12MP ultrawide; 12MP selfie</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 50MP ultrawide + 10 telephoto (3x) + 50MP telephoto (5x); 12MP selfie</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,900mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td><td  ><p>45W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>163g</p></td><td  ><p>218g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Silver Blue, Titanium Black, Titanium White Silver, Titanium Gray, <em>(Samsung.com exclusive: Titanium Jade Green, Titanium Jet Black, Titanium Pink Gold)</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge and Gaalxy S25 Ultra use the same custom 'Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy' chip, so performance should be identical. We are yet to review the S25 Edge and we'll have a full report for you on its performance, but till then you can read out detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra review</a> to know what to expect. I suspect the Edge could have lower thermal thresholds due to its slim size, which could throttle performance of the SoC a lot quicker than the Ultra. This is so that the phone doesn't get excessively hot to hold. It's just an assumption right now as we'll know for certain once we review it.</p><p>Another compromise area is the cameras. The Galaxy S25 Edge only has two rear camera, one of which is the same 200MP main sensor from the Ultra. Samsung also talks about a 2x optical zoom which essentially uses an in-sensor crop to achieve it. The ultrawide is sadly just a 12MP sensor and not a 50MP module from the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has two additional rear cameras for zoom, one 3x telephoto and a 50MP periscope-style telephoto with 5x optical zoom. If you need long-range photography, stick to the Ultra.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bs4kXScTBYTEFvzgXh8PQa" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25 Edge" alt="Samsung-Galaxy-S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bs4kXScTBYTEFvzgXh8PQa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, battery life is one area where the Galaxy S25 Ultra should easily beat the S25 Edge. We're talking a 5,000mAh capacity vs. 3,900mAh. With mindful usage, you should be able to squeeze out a full day's worth of use from the S25 Edge but I wouldn't expect anything beyond that. Heavy app and camera use could knock down battery life even quicker. The S25 Ultra should easily sail through one full day and more on a single charge as no amount of software optimization can compensate for a physically larger battery.</p><p>Charging speeds are also better on the Ultra. You get 45W fast charging here, compared to just 25W on the Edge. Given the smaller size of the battery, 25W should still be decently quick but not as quick as the Ultra. Wireless charging is the same 15W on both phones.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-software-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Mfgezq4tnLd6Z8gF7viLRY" name="drafted-message-google-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-1" alt="Drafted Message from Google Gemini on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mfgezq4tnLd6Z8gF7viLRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy S25 Ultra should have identical software. Both phones run One UI 7 which is based on Android 15, and should be getting all future updates roughly around the same time. Both will be getting seven years of OS upgrades and security patches. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> right around the corner,  we should see the One UI 8 update pop up for both pretty soon, once the new Galaxy foldables are launched.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> is Samsung's best software update yet. The new visual design is very pleasing, you can finally switch the app drawer to vertical scrolling without being forced to install a third-party launcher, there's much better customizability, and plenty of AI-focused add-ons. Among the many Galaxy AI features, some of the standout ones include Photo Assist, Transcript Assist, and Now Brief.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-which-phone-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Which phone should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As much as I love a thin and light phone, I cannot justify recommending the S25  Edge at its current price over the Galaxy S25 Ultra. I'd rather pay the $200 premium and get the complete flagship experience, and this is what I'd suggest you do too. In the long run, I think the heft and bulk of the Ultra is something you'll get used to, but not having certain features like telephoto cameras and a larger battery could end up being nagging issues.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge needs to be cheaper in order for it to be a real, viable option. Even a die-hard Samsung fan will have to really think twice before spending $1,000+ on it. It's a fantastic little flagship, no doubt, but it offers poor value for money at its current price.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cf1746ff-7f40-413b-a4c6-6b84b6cbd9af">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgaXFPcrVwTCJgerdmmLjV.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra official render cropped square"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The one to get</strong></em></p><p>If you can get past the size and weight of the S25 Ultra, it's easily the better phone to get over the S25 Edge.

This will allow the glasses to run Google Play Store apps as well as Google's Gemini AI assistant, all in "a lightweight and tethered device," according to Xreal.</p><p>The render of Project Aura that Xreal provided shows three cameras up front to capture spatial data, meaning the glasses will be able to track the space you're in, similar to a VR headset. While Xreal didn't describe the experience, these glasses will be able to overlay virtual imagery onto the real world, similar to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-mwc-2024">we saw at MWC 2024</a>.

In other words, it will feel even more like a TV sitting in the real world than the glasses current 3DoF solution enables.</p><p>Since Xreal Eye uses a single camera, tracking won't be quite as robust as what will be offered on Project Aura glasses, which features three cameras for greater accuracy.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:134.33%;"><img id="bDzLUdnExotCcMbD3HDAkT" name="xreal-eye-official-render-01" alt="Official product renders of the Xreal Eye camera add-on for Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bDzLUdnExotCcMbD3HDAkT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="268" height="360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:272px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:135.66%;"><img id="xR8ESG7PLWvjLXpSD3kTjT" name="xreal-eye-official-render-02" alt="Official product renders of the Xreal Eye camera add-on for Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xR8ESG7PLWvjLXpSD3kTjT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="272" height="369" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:228px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:127.19%;"><img id="CPaMAiyUTduh7vaGW5DRjT" name="xreal-eye-official-render-03" alt="Official product renders of the Xreal Eye camera add-on for Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CPaMAiyUTduh7vaGW5DRjT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="228" height="290" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:148px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:193.24%;"><img id="tRp88KWuWUzBmhzJ6VXZjT" name="xreal-eye-official-render-04" alt="Official product renders of the Xreal Eye camera add-on for Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tRp88KWuWUzBmhzJ6VXZjT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="148" height="286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Pairing Xreal Eye and Xreal One with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreals-new-ar-glass-companion-brings-android-apps-to-life-in-3d">Xreal Beam Pro</a> will deliver the full experience, including mixed reality video capture straight from the glasses' point of view.

Like in previous years, the focus is again on AI and its incorporation into its services.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/new-ways-to-do-your-best-work">showcased</a> a glimpse of AI integration in its Workspace products like Gmail, Meet, Vids, and Docs, and they get new capabilities.</p><h2 id="gemini-in-gmail-2">Gemini in Gmail</h2><p>Starting with Gmail, regular users will now be able to reply to their emails with the help of AI. In instances like replying to an email or a thread where gathering previous details could be an intriguing task, new personalized replies in Gmail are coming into play. Users can draft their emails through AI suggestions that match their specific context and tone.</p><p>The response suggestions here will be based on past emails, alongside Google Drive, to get additional context. Google notes that Gemini can further adapt to users’ tone eventually, which can be crisp, formal, or conversational.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CXHYTwTwjhFEvLYqP2RL8W" name="Gmail-personalized-replies-feature" alt="Gmail personalized replies feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CXHYTwTwjhFEvLYqP2RL8W.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of emails, they tend to generally pile up, making users difficult to manage sometimes. That's where Gemini comes to your rescue again, as it can now start deleting or archiving emails with the new Inbox clean-up. Users will be able to tell Gemini to “delete all of my unread emails” from any specific user or a subscription to tidy up things in their inbox.</p><p>Additionally, fast appointment scheduling will be integrated into Gmail soon. It means users will be able to offer times for customers or clients who are normally out of their organization and not in their conventional calendar. Gemini in Gmail will also be able to detect when a user is trying to set up a meeting and give users “a helpful nudge,” making it easier to share the booking page right within the email app. The aim is to sort things out by reducing the time and effort spent coordinating schedules.</p><p>All the aforementioned features for Gmail will be available for the next quarter.</p><h2 id="google-meet-gains-language-translation-2">Google Meet gains language translation</h2><p>Google Meet should soon be able to diminish language barriers in calls as it is gaining a speech translation feature. It helps listeners in a call listen to their language despite the speaker speaking in their preferred language, that too in real time. Google is also promising low-latency while maintaining their voice, tone, and expression. Overall, the conversation across both parties is likely to appear more authentic and natural.</p><p>The speech translation feature is available for Google Meet users for those who are subscribed to Google AI Pro and Ultra plans in beta, and is initially available in English and Spanish. More of them are promised to be added in the coming weeks.</p><h2 id="google-vids-can-turn-slides-into-videos-2">Google Vids can turn slides into videos</h2><p>Google Vids, which was launched last year, is now gaining notable features. They can now turn existing Google Slides into engaging videos. Slides or presentations can sometimes be boring; however, they are essential in organizations, be it to train teams, onboard new employees, and explain things. Such slides can now easily be converted into videos through Google Vids, which presumably captures the audience’s attention more than the slides.</p><p>Gemini is further believed to generate scripts, voiceovers, animations, and more.</p><p>Google Vids usually help users record things, and they can sometimes have distracting or filler words like “ums” and “ahs”. Integration of Gemini in Vids will help users trim such filler words and awkward pauses through the transcript trim feature, which can be triggered with a single click. With the help of AI, users will also be able to adjust sound levels in instances where sound quality is uneven, eliminating the need for complicated audio mixing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V29y65jKLKqEgdfpuRXBsK" name="Google-Slides-to-videos" alt="Google Slides to video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V29y65jKLKqEgdfpuRXBsK.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Making training videos can be a hideous task, especially if there are dozens of them. Google Vids already allows users to make videos, and going further, users can just write a script and choose a new AI avatar feature to deliver the message on behalf of you. While the avatar does the talking, it claims to be handy to create polished video content and skip the process of coordinating talent and video production.</p><p>While converting slides to videos will be available for users next quarter, the Balance sound will be available next month, and transcript trim will arrive in Labs next quarter. The AI Avatar, on the other hand, is coming to Labs next month. Interestingly, all these features are included for those who are on a Google AI Pro or Ultra plan.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TUFaAEnWFQZz3vtUJExtd7" name="Google-Vids-AI-Avatar" alt="Google Vids" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TUFaAEnWFQZz3vtUJExtd7.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="imagen-4-in-workspace-2">Imagen 4 in Workspace</h2><p>Generating an image in Slides, Vids, and Docs just got better with the inclusion of Imagen 4—  announced today at Google I/O. It promises to enhance users’ visual storytelling as Imagen 4 helps create richer, detailed visuals, accurate spelling, and text rendering for images. And, it is available for users starting today.</p><h2 id="google-docs-gets-gemini-enhancements-2">Google Docs gets Gemini Enhancements</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ec7nhJrjgbfV9LN8RwsZJ7" name="Google-Docs-Gemini-enhancements" alt="Google Docs Gemini Integration" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ec7nhJrjgbfV9LN8RwsZJ7.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is also launching a source-grounded writing assistance to help users concentrate better when writing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-is-tapping-into-gemini-to-whip-up-formatted-documents">Google Docs.</a> The sources that are typically dispersed around decks, data, and documents — and further stored in external links and Google Drive — can be brought into the assistant pane with the help of Gemini.</p><p>Users will be able to link relevant decks, data, and reports directly into a Google Docs document, where Gemini will be able to pull from these sources and simultaneously provide writing assistance. It further keeps suggestions intact and grounded in trusted content and eliminates the need for switching tabs. The feature is said to be available next quarter.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This plan is firmly set on the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, which Google says is wants to morph into a "world model." Hassabis states there's are hopes for Gemini to become an AI that can "make plans and imagine new experiences." This will reportedly be done by enabling the AI to "understand and simulate aspects of the world."</p><p>Google attributes this way of thinking and forethought to that of the human brain.</p><p>Hassabis says the company isn't starting from zero with these ambitions. The company has reportedly observed instances of this world understanding and simulation in Gemini when natural environments are involved. Google stresses that it wants Gemini to become intelligent, one that can understand the "context you're in" and "take action on your behalf, across devices."</p><p>Speaking of tasks, Hassabis explains that Google has been mulling over the thought of bringing Project Mariner into Gemini for multitasking.</p><h2 id="project-mariner-astra-2">Project Mariner & Astra</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.19%;"><img id="scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP" name="google-project-astra-enters-signup-phase" alt="Google's Project Astra lets testers point their cameras at items within its app to receive information about it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1050" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner</a> revealed itself to users in December, and Google says it's been hard at work, working with testers to gather feedback on it. Since December, Mariner has grown to have the ability to complete ten tasks at once, says Hassabis. The agents within Project Mariner enable the software to research information, book shows or other events, and research topics all at once.</p><p>It's this level of multitasking that Hassabis says will help usher Gemini into that "world model" ideal.</p><p>What's more, Project Astra will work in tandem with Mariner to bring Gemini into a more universal setting. Google states Astra's functions, like video understanding, screen sharing, and memory, will be a great asset. Project Astra has since worked its way into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>. From that, Google's taken in a load of feedback from users to bring even more to Gemini Live, Search, and the Live API.</p><p>In March, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">announced</a> that it was bringing Project Astra to Gemini.

This enabled people to have remote conversations that felt more like face-to-face interactions. Google is taking this "Magic window" concept of seeing another person, in life-size, three dimensions, right in front of you, and turning it into an AI-powered experience.</p><p>In its press release, Google noted that it will use AI to power a new generation of devices that will allow people to have meaningful conversations even though they're remote.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yEAwcPR9swrvKSD3jQxJab" name="google-project-starline-call.gif" alt="Talking to someone on Project Starline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yEAwcPR9swrvKSD3jQxJab.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/research/project-starline-google-beam-update/">Google Beam </a>aims to transform regular 2D video calls into more realistic 3D experiences. Essentially, what this means is that the platform will use the AI tech and special light field displays, multiple cameras, as seen in Project Starline, to build a live, detailed, 3D digital copy for the user.</p><p>That copy is then displayed to the person on the other side, using the same special light field display. This screen sends different light rays to each eye, creating the illusion of depth and volume without the need for special glasses or headsets. So Google Beam will make it seem like the 3D copy of the other person is actually "there" in the room with you.</p><p>"This is what allows you to make eye contact, read subtle cues, and build understanding and trust, as if you were face to face," Google added.</p><p>Furthermore, this video conferencing platform is built on Google Cloud, just like Project Starline. The Cloud will do most of the heavy lifting for Google Beam. It will help the platform process these AI-powered 3D images and transmit them in real time to the person on the other end of the call, allowing for a seamless flow of 3D communication that seems more natural.</p><h2 id="real-time-speech-translation-2">Real time speech translation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WXsZ2hcC4opVgmiLkQh7VW" name="Beam-feature" alt="Google Beam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WXsZ2hcC4opVgmiLkQh7VW.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Along with Google Beam, the company is launching a real-time speech translation feature that allows people to speak freely, despite having language barriers.</p><p>This feature will let you have "near real-time translated conversations, while maintaining the voice, tone, and expressions" within the speech. For instance, if two people on a call speak different languages, such as French and English, each person can speak in their preferred language, and Google Beam will then translate the audio in real time.</p><p>Additionally, Google isn't restricting this feature just to Google Beam; it is expanding the real-time translation to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">Google Meet</a>, starting today. Users on Meet can enable the live translation feature to have seamless conversations during meetings.</p><p>The speech translation feature is available to users subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-one/google-ai-ultra">Google AI Pro and Ultra plans</a> in beta.
