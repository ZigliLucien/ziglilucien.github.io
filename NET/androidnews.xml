<ul><li>Xfinity and Spectrum Mobile are planning to give their customers satellite messaging on select Android phones "in the coming weeks."</li><li>At launch, only the Samsung Galaxy S25 and the Google Pixel 9 lineups are supported.</li><li>The move follows Verizon's introduction of satellite messaging on those same devices yesterday, in an industry first.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> and the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9"> Google Pixel 9</a> series support satellite connectivity, and major U.S. cellular carriers are gearing up to offer free satellite messaging for users of those models. Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum are both planning to offer satellite texting for customers "in the coming weeks" with a Galaxy S25 or Pixel 9. The move comes just one day after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-wireless/verizon-satellite-texting-us-customers-first-select-phones">Verizon became the first carrier to offer the service</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/charter-and-comcast-launch-satellite-connectivity-for-mobile-devices" target="_blank">announcement</a> reveals that Charter Communications and Comcast, which operate Xfinity and Spectrum Mobile respectively, are partnering with Skylo to deliver satellite messaging. The new functionality will give customers the "ability to send and receive SMS text messages over satellite service" and is "expected to be added in the coming weeks," per the company.</p><p>For now, satellite messaging appears to be limited to the Galaxy S25 lineup and the Pixel 9 series. Verizon's offering only applies to those models, and the same goes for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/samsung-expands-comcast-5g-xfinity-mobile">Xfinity Mobile</a> and Spectrum's planned service.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Ce4YyBPCnC7DLSyM5wmBuE" name="Google-Pixel-9-satellite-sos-outdoors" alt="Holding the Google Pixel 9 with a Satellite SOS demo active" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ce4YyBPCnC7DLSyM5wmBuE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3958" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The satellite messaging capabilities that will soon be offered by Spectrum and Xfinity Mobile will allow customers to text any number when Wi-Fi and cellular is unavailable using overhead satellites. This is in addition to the existing "Satellite SOS" feature offered by Google, which is only available in an emergency.</p><p>Spectrum and Xfinity Mobile aren't offering satellite messaging for iPhone users, but they might not need it as much as Android users. Starting with iOS 18, Apple offers free satellite messaging for users with an iPhone 14 or newer. Even though Samsung and Google sell phones capable of satellite connectivity, they've opted to leave it up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">cellular carriers</a> to provide the feature with their own non-terrestrial network (NTN) service providers.</p><p>"The availability of satellite backup service provides Spectrum Mobile customers with a sense of security, knowing they can stay connected even in the most remote locations," said Danny Bowman, who is the executive vice president of product at Charter Communications, in a press release.</p>

<ul><li>Gmail is rolling out a new, upgraded version of mail search that can prioritize "most relevant" results.</li><li>Users can still manually sort "most recent" results to get the list in chronological order.</li><li>The feature is rolling out now for personal Google accounts, and will eventually come to business accounts in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is upgrading Gmail's search smarts with AI to prioritize relevant results over recent keyword hits, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-search-update-relevant-emails/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, March 20. While the old version of search in Gmail showed the most recent keyword results in emails, the upgraded version will "now factor in elements like recency, most-clicked emails and frequent contacts."</p><p>The AI-powered search feature is arriving in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail">Gmail</a> as "Most relevant" results. Users can now toggle between "Most relevant" and "Most recent," depending on the situation. Previously, Gmail defaulted to showing "Most recent" search results, and that was the only option available.</p><p>"With this update, the emails you’re looking for are far more likely to be at the top of your search results — saving you valuable time and helping you find important information more easily," the company explains in the blog post.</p><p>You can see an example of how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gmail-android-how-to">Gmail</a> search results are changing in the graphic below, which shows the old results on the left and the new ones on the right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="cUVfCJm6ycQ46BUZVXvSV4" name="Gmail-Search-Upgrades" alt="The old and new search results in the Gmail app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUVfCJm6ycQ46BUZVXvSV4.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new version of search is rolling out worldwide in Gmail's web client, as well as the iOS and Android mobile apps. The feature will begin exclusive to personal Google accounts, though the company says it will expand upgraded Gmail search to business accounts "in the future."</p><p>Google has been steadily upgrading Gmail with artificial intelligence to make it easier to use, and more secure. At the end of last year, Gmail became equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-now-uses-a-new-ai-model-to-try-and-fend-off-holiday-scams">a new AI model designed to thwart phishing scams in emails</a>. This addition following similar scam-stopping AI features being added to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">Google Messages</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/real-time-scam-detection-is-rolling-out-now-in-google-phone-app-beta">Google Phone</a>.</p><p>Time will tell whether users prefer the new version of Gmail search over the old one. For people who constantly have to scroll to find old emails, "Most relevant" results may be more helpful. For others, switching back to "Most recent" could be a better option.</p>

That knocks the price of the super-powered smartphone down to only $499, which is <em>the same price</em> that the Pixel 9a is scheduled to have when it finally hits store shelves next month. No trade-in required, zero hassle involved. </p><p>To be totally honest, I&apos;m half-expecting Best Buy to remove the deal when they realize they&apos;ve made a mistake, so <strong>I&apos;d jump on this opportunity </strong><em><strong>fast</strong></em> if you&apos;re interested. </p>

<p><strong>Heads up, Google fans: this is NOT a test. </strong>You can buy the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> from Best Buy and get a whopping $600 off your purchase with carrier activation. That means you're getting Google's best device for the price of the budget-friendly Pixel 9a with no trade-in required. </p>
<p>The retailer is also offering up to $840 of trade-in credit when you send in an old or broken device, which means you could even get the phone for free if you're lucky. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587896.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="75095aa8-13aa-4c7a-b2a7-f6c6c23b8966" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099" data-dimension48="$1,099">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Google&apos;s answer to the premium Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is a super-powered device with a huge 6.8-inch AMOLED display, efficient Tensor G4 processor, and an impressive 16GB of RAM. You also get the latest AI-boosted software features, seven years of OS/security updates, and all of the fancy camera tech that made Google such a legendary OEM. </p><p>If I had to dig up some drawbacks, I&apos;d say it&apos;s a shame that the phone in question only comes with 128GB of storage, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl">comparing it with the S25 Ultra</a>, you&apos;re also losing the convenience of a built-in stylus. But again, this Best Buy deal is knocking the price down to only $499, so I&apos;m not going to spend too much time complaining. By all means skip this deal if you&apos;re happy with your current phone, but if you&apos;ve already had your eye on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, this offer is worth your immediate attention. </p>

At the heart of this revolution lies the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gigahertz-versus-cores-what-makes-a-good-phone-chip">System on a Chip</a> (SoC), a single integrated circuit that houses the CPU, GPU, modem, and a host of other specialized processors.</p><p>While companies like Apple and Google are known for "building" custom smartphone chips, they don't actually manufacture them. Samsung also designs chips <em>and</em> can build them, albeit in a different division of the company. Qualcomm has changed the industry forever by designing things nobody could ever build without them, and the company lets others build the actual products.</p><p>So, how do these tech giants design and bring these powerful components to life? The answer lies in a complex interplay of design expertise, intellectual property, and a specialized manufacturing ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="turning-an-idea-into-a-blueprint-2">Turning an idea into a blueprint</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="C5wrVzh2qxxkb6wMmzSomF" name="8-gen.jpg" alt="Snapdragon 8 Gen 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5wrVzh2qxxkb6wMmzSomF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The journey begins with the design phase, where teams of engineers, architects, and researchers conceptualize the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/arm-announces-new-chip-architecture-focus-performance-security-and-ai">chip's architecture</a>. This involves defining the chip's functionalities, performance targets, and power efficiency goals.</p><p>For Apple, this means optimizing for iOS and its specific applications; for Google, it's about tailoring the chip to Android and its burgeoning AI capabilities. Samsung and Qualcomm need to build chips that anyone can use. It's not easy.</p><p>The core of the chip's design is its architecture. This dictates the arrangement of the various processing units and how they interact. Apple, for instance, invests heavily in its custom CPU and GPU designs, aiming for superior performance per watt. Google, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor chips</a>, focuses on integrating specialized AI accelerators for on-device machine learning. Qualcomm strikes a balance between performance in all areas and connectivity options.</p><p>Each company knows what it needs better than anyone else does.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t5si5YMrmbX7vSmrEHpFSd" name="apple-a18-graphic" alt="Apple A18 chip graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t5si5YMrmbX7vSmrEHpFSd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once done on paper, engineers need to describe and build out the chip's logic. Hardware Description Languages (HDL) like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chipverify.com/tutorials/verilog" target="_blank">Verilog or VHDL</a> are used to "program" every behavior of the chip's circuits: every transistor, logic gate, and even the connections between them all.</p><p>Once someone is satisfied that this is going to work, the testing begins before anything is ever built. Software is used to simulate various behaviors, looking for bottlenecks in performance and potential errors and determining what other IP could be licensed to make a chip even better. Nothing is built in a vacuum, and no one company can do it all; the best products are a happy collaboration.</p><p>From there, the process is physically laid out by crazy smart people with backgrounds in electronics, physics, and manufacturing. Finally, parts can be built.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="pfyVzktcAoqKdPZy5xx7fc" name="samsung-exynos-chip-generic-hero.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos chip mockup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pfyVzktcAoqKdPZy5xx7fc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2149" height="1210" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple or Qualcomm don't build their own chips. Neither does Google, and even the divisions at Samsung designing new products aren't usually the same ones creating them. For that, you need a semiconductor foundry. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">TSMC</a> is one of the biggest, but there are others — including Samsung's own foundry.</p><p>The company that designed the chip works very closely with the foundry. There's a lot of back and forth to optimize the design for better performance and ease of manufacturing, and the final specifications are drawn out before the first chip rolls off the line.</p><p>The process of building a semiconductor is wild. Using complex masks and stencils, a chip is built layer by layer in rooms where not even a spec of dust is allowed. It's a total sci-fi vibe for a sci-fi product. The results are continually tested so the "good" chips make it to the customer who ordered them, then into your hands.</p>

<p>It's easy to think of fabless semiconductor design as sort of like outsourcing, but it's a lot more than just a cost-saving initiative.</p><p>It allows a company like Apple or Qualcomm, who are well known for building excellent smartphone chips, to focus on the design and licensing of outside IP to build a product that meets consumer's exact needs.</p><p>Instead of trying to build and maintain advanced state-of-the-art facilities, they can partner with a company that has both the means and the experience to do it right. This makes adapting to an ever-changing market much easier.</p><p>Expertise in chip design, combined with strategic partnerships with leading manufacturers, allows them to create some of the most powerful and efficient smartphone chips on the market. This intricate ecosystem, where design expertise meets manufacturing prowess, is what drives the relentless innovation in the world of mobile technology.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Google Pixel 9a is official but won't be available until April. While people will still be deciding whether to buy the Pixel 9a or not, it's fun to deliberate about what next Spring's Pixel 10a might look like and if it's worth waiting for.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9a ushered in the biggest design change since the Pixel 6a, ditching the trademark Pixel camera bar for a nearly completely flat design. Google said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-inspiration-behind-pixel-camera-bar">the camera bar wouldn't stick around forever</a>, but few of us thought the company would ditch it this soon.</p><p>We've already seen a few leaks for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> series, including information relating to its chipset as well as model numbers for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-10-has-a-model-number-according-to-gsma-database-entries">wider Pixel 10 family</a>. For now, though, let's focus on Google's next budget-friendly phone, the Pixel 10a.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10a-what-s-likely-to-change"><span>Google Pixel 10a: What's likely to change</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest bit of concrete evidence we have on the Pixel 10a so far is its processor. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-pixel-10a-pixel-11-series-codename-chip-leak">According to one leak</a>, the Google Pixel 10a will ship with a "boosted" version of the Tensor G4 chip inside the Pixel 9a. If so, that would mark the first time the company would ship a <em>different</em> chipset from the mainline series in a Pixel A-series phone, at least since Google started making Tensor chipsets.</p><p>Up until now, Google has shipped a nearly identical Tensor processor in A-series phones, enabling excellent photography capabilities, AI processing, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-many-software-updates-will-the-google-pixel-9a-get">years of promised software updates</a>. However, Google has long had an issue with performance <em>and</em> overheating, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> was the first to solve only half of that equation — the overheating issue.</p><p>A boosted Tensor G4 could mean that Google is further tweaking the Tensor G4's thermal properties, allowing the company to speed the processor up without reintroducing the old overheating problems of Pixels' past.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 10a might be the first Tensor-based Pixel that doesn't get the same processor as the rest of the familial line.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The downside to this strategy is that the Pixel 10a wouldn't benefit from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">the Tensor G5</a> that's rumored to launch inside the rest of the Pixel 10 series. While we're not expecting the Tensor G5 to introduce many major performance improvements, the new processor is rumored to come alongside a suite of changes that could prove beneficial, including a new GPU, a new ISP, and a new display processor.</p><p>This could mean that the Pixel 10a doesn't see display, camera, or gaming performance improvements compared to the rest of the Pixel 10 series. Of course, all of this is based on leaks and rumors, but it's worth noting the hypothetical.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk-3" alt="All four Google Pixel 9a phones in each color (Iris, Peony, Porcelain, and Obsidian) placed artistically against or in front of a wooden display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel A-series is long overdue for charging improvements and an LTPO display.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Every generation, we see Google add at least one display enhancement from the mainline Pixel series to the equivalent Pixel A-series. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> introduced a 120Hz display for the first time in Pixel A-series history, while the Pixel 9a's display is now as bright as the ones on the rest of the Pixel 9 series. The only thing missing is LTPO technology, which we surmise Google will add next year to further improve battery life.</p><p>Speaking of battery life, the Pixel A-series is long overdue for a charging speed upgrade. Google gave the Pixel 9a a very <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-fast-is-the-google-pixel-9a-charging-speed">minor charging speed bump</a>, but the mainline Pixel 9 series charges <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-charging-speed">twice as fast</a>. Even that pales in comparison to competitors like OnePlus, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">offers 80W charging</a> <em>with a charger included</em> in the box. It's very possible that the Pixel 10a may finally adopt 30W charging to keep up with the pack, but I don't foresee Google doing more than that.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We could see the return of multiple phone sizes with the Pixel 10a, something we haven't seen since the Pixel 4a days.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Lastly is the possibility that Google could finally offer multiple sizes of the Pixel 10a. The last time the company offered multiple Pixel A-series model sizes was with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4a-5g-vs-pixel-4a">Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G</a>. A rumor circled for a while that the Pixel 8a would see the return of multiple sizes, but that has yet to materialize.</p><p>While we're certainly not confident that Google <strong>will</strong> return to offering multiple sizes, the company has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/there-are-too-many-pixel-phones">expanding its portfolio of devices</a> in recent years, so now would make a lot of sense for them to make a move like this.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10a-what-we-expect-to-stay-the-same"><span>Google Pixel 10a: What we expect to stay the same</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KAksn6WMNiah55RUJEYLCB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk-2" alt="The Iris, Peony, Obsidian, and Porcelain Google Pixel 9a in a jumbled pile on a brown desk surface." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KAksn6WMNiah55RUJEYLCB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seeing as how the Pixel 9a just drastically changed the design compared to the Pixel 6a, 7a, and 8a, we don't expect the company to change much for the Pixel 10a. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/news-weekly-march-15-2025">Pixel 10 leaks</a> show that Google is largely keeping the design identical between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 series, so there's not much reason to expect it would do anything different with the Pixel 10a.</p><p>Likewise, the Pixel 10a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">ditched the camera bar</a> to make a thicker, flatter phone with a bigger battery. As such, there's little reason to expect Google to change the battery at all on the Pixel 10a. Thankfully, though, the Pixel 9a boasts the best battery life of any Tensor-based Pixel phone to date, at least on paper.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Don't expect to see many design or camera changes next year.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>On the subject of cameras, leaks show that Google may offer a telephoto camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">on the smaller Pixel 10</a> this year, but we haven't seen anything that points to a telephoto camera being offered on a Pixel A-series device yet. If Google does make multiple sizes of the Pixel 10a, there's a possibility that we could see the addition of a telephoto camera. Otherwise, don't count on that changing.</p><p>We also don't foresee Google changing the $499 price much, if at all, for the Pixel 10a. All things considered, Google's aim with this series is to keep it as affordable as possible. With the rumor that the Pixel 10a will be using a Tensor G4 again, plus several design changes on the Pixel 9a that make manufacturing simpler and less expensive, there's no reason to think Google will change the price in 2026.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 series was announced several months before the Pixel 8 series, launching in August 2024 instead of the traditional October timeline. That trend stayed the same with the Pixel 9a which was announced in mid-March rather than in mid-May when Google I/O takes place.</p><p>It doesn't seem like Google will repeat this trend and will likely keep the Pixel 10 series on an annual release timeline. Even if they do continue the 2-month-early trend, that means the earliest we'll hear anything official about the Google Pixel 10a will be sometime in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p>Until then, we'll be covering every leak and rumor that gives us a clearer picture of what Google's 2026 budget release will pack.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-deals"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro deals</span></h3>
<p>For the first time ever, the Pixel 9 Pro is the same size as the base model Google Pixel 9 — but fear not, things still look quite different under the hood. The Google Pixel 9 Pro boasts the Tensor G4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, plus you get an improved 42 MP front camera system and a telephoto lens (another first for Google devices). The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 for the 128GB version, and there&apos;s also a more-expensive 1TB version if you need additional storage.</p>

<p>The first two-hour session of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/starship-home-mixed-reality-game-impressions">Starship Home</a> that I finished was met with a surreal sense of spatial juxtaposition. One moment ago, my living room was a starship complete with alien plants and an infinite storage system that tied in neatly with my basement. The next moment, I was back to my normal old living room with nothing nearly as exciting in it.</p><p>Another recent mixed reality game, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">The Last Stand</a>, turned my living room into a store in the mall. This sounds rather strange until the zombies start breaking in the boarded-up windows, and you suddenly realize you've been placed in a movie frame of the classic movie Dawn of the Dead. Even after taking the headset off, I expected a zombie to break through my sliding glass door at any moment.</p><p>It's this sense of "making new memories in people's physical spaces" that gets me so excited about mixed reality games and why Meta's latest mixed reality capabilities update is so important. Meta Quest developers can now use your Meta Quest 3's cameras to create even more immersive content thanks to the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough/">camera passthrough API</a>.</p><p>So what does this mean and how is Meta protecting your privacy? Between Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/gdc-2025-design-strategies-considerations-tips-mr-vr-horizon-os/">blog post</a>, the company's presentation at GDC, and my own discussions with Meta representatives and Meta Quest developers, I've found some rather interesting new concepts developers are working with to create the future of immersive mixed reality gaming.</p>
<h2 id="camera-data-is-the-pandora-s-box-of-mixed-reality-2">Camera data is the Pandora's Box of mixed reality</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BnEHje5EXkFwjwLDJXywSa" name="wall-town-wonders-quest-3s-hero" alt="Playing Wall Town Wonders in mixed reality on a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BnEHje5EXkFwjwLDJXywSa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a long time, Meta has restricted Meta Quest camera access to developers. Games like Starship Home, The Last Stand, The Infinite Inside, and <em>all</em> others rely entirely on what the Meta Horizon OS tells them your room looks like. These games only know your walls exist because the OS tells them. Likewise, your dining room table might be considered a desk because you defined that during the headset's setup process.</p><p>Everything was pre-baked, including the size and shape, which means developers could only work with whatever data the headset fed them. Now, thanks to a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough/">camera passthrough API</a>, Meta Quest apps are able to actually <strong>see</strong> your room — assuming you permit them — and understand the objects within.</p><p>Let's look at a side-by-side of what I'm talking about:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3838px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:32.18%;"><img id="2ME7VMv4JnqRRAUdnmZEV8" name="meta-quest-3-camera-passthrough-data-march-2025" alt="Meta Quest 3 room setup and passthrough image data from the older camera space setup API" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ME7VMv4JnqRRAUdnmZEV8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3838" height="1235" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The current mixed reality kit is very boxy. Future apps and games will finally understand room geometry and nuance that makes mixed reality games more convincing.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While the headset is mapping your room during the initial setup process, you'll see it building a complex mesh of polygons so it can recreate your physical space in a virtual environment. This data was previously only accessible by the headset itself and never shared with an app.</p><p>Instead, the app would only be given the data on the right. Notice how the box that defines my couches doesn't line up with the actual height of the couch since the couch <em>isn't a box</em>? The same problem occurs with my dining room table, which is oval in shape, yet the older room setup only allows for square or rectangular tables.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3kgH2xvfmRuj88rbWTvqZD" name="meta-quest-3-camera-passthrough-mixed-reality-game" alt="Virtual characters standing on top of a physical couch unconvincingly due to geometry constraints of older Meta Quest space understanding models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3kgH2xvfmRuj88rbWTvqZD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Soon, these characters in Twenty Guys may be standing on your actual couch instead of the predefined boundaries the headset creates. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>This new solution allows apps and games to better identify the space around you, resulting in more realistic (and less hokey) mixed reality experiences.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Now that Meta is expanding the use of camera data to apps, developers may soon be able to program their apps and games to more intelligently understand the geometry of objects. That means no more weirdly floating characters in a mixed-reality space.</p><p>That also means when a virtual object hides behind a physical one, it'll look much more convincing since it won't be hiding behind a square box but, instead, your rather curvy living room chair. This can extend to zombies banging on your windows instead of virtual recreations of a window, goop oozing out of sinks, spiders <em>convincingly </em>crawling out of vents, etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-is-in-flux-2">The future is in flux</h2>
<p>After Apple Vision Pro launched, lots of people came up with interesting ideas of what mixed reality concepts could look like. Some used mixed reality to gamify chores so you can vacuum <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/19dpo3v/spatial_vacuuming_never_miss_a_spot_again/">and never miss a spot again</a>. Apps like this will work even better now that they have access to camera data, as they'll be able to properly identify areas rather than just using prebuilt data from the headset.</p><p>Others used the idea to completely transform their rooms into completely different decor using generative AI. While this video is a mockup and not a real app you can use today, it might give you an idea of what to expect from mixed reality concepts in the future:</p>
<div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBbdiGqJxpk/" target="_blank">A post shared by Technology (@technology)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div>
<p>The new passthrough camera API is built upon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/media/camera/camera2">Android's Camera2 API</a>, according to Meta, helping it tie deeply in with the Quest's hardware. This means apps can utilize data from the camera and adjust it as needed, helping virtual objects to better match the lighting and color of your room.</p><p>Things look different during sunlit days than they do in artificial nighttime light, and this new API can help play a part in making those virtual objects look more convincing in your actual space.</p><p>In addition to that, the new API lets apps use the Quest's camera to capture imagery of your room and add it to virtual objects. This can be as simple as taking a picture of a person's face and adding it to a rudimentary character model — as you see above — or something more realistic like your actual living room reflecting in a pool of virtual water in a game.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The new passthrough API allows the Quest's cameras to capture your room and put it on virtual objects, or just more seamlessly blend the virtual and real worlds.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Better spatial awareness will enable your headset to further transform the room around you into something both familiar yet unique and always memorable. Spatial awareness holds a special meaning for our brains and even bespoke experiences like this masterful airplane cockpit someone built.</p><p>From what I've seen, this is one of the most convincing uses of mixed reality to date. Most people don't have access to an empty airplane cockpit in their garage, but being able to turn your favorite chair into a convincing airplane cockpit — complete with its texture accurately positioned inside the virtual cockpit — would make an incredibly convincing game of Flight Simulator without all the expensive add-ons and accessories some people spend a lot of money on.</p><p>As with anything XR, this is just the beginning of something new and interesting that'll play a part in what's coming down the line. Google's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> operating system also allows passthrough access for apps, meaning developers can get a jump start on making concepts now so that games and apps are more mature when that OS — and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">future AR glasses hardware</a> — begins shipping to customers, content will be there waiting for them.</p>

Even though Apple is still at the top of the table, it saw the highest decline percentage in sales of 19%. Counterpoint Research claims that this could be due to several reasons, including people opting out of an upgrade due to a lack of new features or design. The research firm also says it could be because their first-time experience with the watch didn't go as planned.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Wear OS-powered watches and those running proprietary OSes scored some brownie points from customers as smartwatch sales saw a steady uptick this past year despite an overall slump across the globe.</p><p>Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei saw exponential growth, especially the former making its way to the top five this year. Xiaomi also became the fastest-growing brand, seeing a 135% rise in sales, thanks to the Watch S1<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/xiaomi-watch-wear-os-3-rumor"> </a>and Redmi Watch series.

<p>Ten years ago, Apple released its first-ever Apple Watch Series, which was initially seen as a fashion accessory. That slowly took a turn to become the multi-faceted fitness tracker it is today.</p><p>According to data from Demandsage (a research firm), Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.demandsage.com/smartwatch-statistics/#:~:text=There%20are%20454.69%20million%20smartwatch%20users%20worldwide.">rules</a> 21% of the global smartwatch market, but the recent decline in sales for the first time points to evolving customer preferences, increased competition from other brands, and a slowing upgrade cycle.</p><p>"Apple’s steep decline was a result of the combination of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentlawyermagazine.com/apple-v-masimo-the-clash-over-pulse-oximetry-patents/">Apple's infringement lawsuit against Masimo</a>, increasing market competition, less significant upgrades in Watch Series 10, and the absence of Watch Ultra 3," Counterpoint's Senior Research Analyst Anshika Jain told Android Central in an email.</p>

<p>Much like its iPhones today, Apple has stuck to the same Watch design for years. The first significant change showed up on the Apple Watch 4, which brought about larger screens and a more defined casing while maintaining the same rounded rectangular dial. Later the Series 7 brought with it thinner bezels, and even more larger screens. Cut to the Series 8, where Apple decided to give its watches a more rugged look and launched the Ultra (a sight for sore eyes).</p><p>Don't get me wrong, Apple has brought several advancements in tech, sensors, and processors over the years. But its overall "look" at first glance remained the same.</p><p>According to Gemini's AI Overviews, "people generally upgrade their Apple Watches every 2-3 years." Or when they notice significant performance issues or a life-altering feature, they'd want to ditch a year-old watch for a new one. For instance, I currently own an Apple Watch Series 8, which was a replacement and not a planned upgrade.</p><p>My Series 6 stopped working after water damage while swimming, which made it practically unusable. The Series 8 brought with it features that track women's health better, and for someone with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, owning a watch that predicts ovulation cycles was a neat feature to have, and I continue to use it to date.</p><p>Jain also agrees that "the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases," especially in North America— which was the biggest driver of this decline in sales for Apple.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Wear OS is the only real alternative if you want app support and rich notifications</p><figcaption><cite>Nick Sutrich</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>While it would be unfair to pit Apple against the broader variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, due to the sheer number of manufacturers involved. However, as much as it isn't fair, Wear OS has become the undeniable alternative for many, sporting a ton of options, has seamlessly integrated into the Android ecosystem without people needing to change devices, and does almost everything that an Apple Watch could do.</p><p>Android Central's senior editor, Nick Sutrich, who uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, highlights the same. Switching between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and the OnePlus Watch 3, Sutrich says that he has two main reasons why the Apple Watch just isn't for him. One, it's incompatibility with Android, and two, he hates the shape they come in.</p><p>"Wear OS is the only real alternative if you want app support and rich notifications," Sutrich said. "I'd say I don't have a perfect choice at the moment. I prefer the Pixel Watch's size but like the OnePlus Watch 3's design and its battery life," Sutrich explained, demonstrating the flexibility that Wear OS watches bring, allowing users to pick between features that matter the most to them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-google-pixel-watch-3" alt="Wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3 on separate arms to compare them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond that, Wear OS, much like Android, is an open ecosystem that allows more freedom in terms of app availability and customization; for instance, Wear OS users can even create their own watch faces using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">Watch Face Format</a> available to those with a developer account. This freedom of personalizing your wearable without worrying about the phone's compatibility appeals to several people who choose to use a Samsung or a Pixel smartwatch over an Apple.</p><p>Furthermore, the affordability and hardware variety of Wear OS also drives people to reach for them. The recent decision of OEMs like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and OPPO to join the Wear OS family, which was mostly dominated by Samsung and Google, has not only resulted in a diverse range of watch designs and styles to pick from but has also made smartwatches much more accessible for those on a tight budget. This might've potentially impacted Apple's sales as well, according to Jain.</p><p>"Huawei’s comeback with Harmony OS, the rise of Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Honor, and the adoption of Samsung’s newly launched Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Galaxy Watch FE series intensified competition for Apple in 2024," she added.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-future-hold-2">What does the future hold?</h2>
<p>While the overall smartwatch sales did see a dip globally, this could also be attributed to several people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/gadgets/are-smart-rings-the-future-smartwatch-sales-decline-as-wearable-trends-shift">wanting to move away from smartwatches</a> for a much smaller fitness tracker like the smart ring. For instance, Android Central's EIC, Shruti Shekar, says she never really cared for watches; after using the Apple Watch 5—which negatively impacted her mental wellbeing, she decided to get an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a>.</p><p>"I took on the ring and found myself loving it so much more than the watch," she explained. "I found the passive health nature of the Oura Ring a lot more up my alley than a watch."</p><p>That said, the future of Apple and Wear OS watches seems promising as both brands are working on bringing advanced health-tracking features. For instance, the Apple Watch Series 11 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-watch-series-11#:~:text=The%20Apple%20Watch%20Series%2011,contrast%20as%20an%20OLED%20screen." target="_blank">rumored</a> to have blood glucose tracking and satellite messaging features in the next Watch Ultra, which could turn the tide in their direction, according to Jain.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iTGJfBgcANT3ijxCKkDPNZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-health-sensors-underside-02" alt="A top-down view of the OnePlus Watch 3 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2 (right) without bands, showing the health sensors and connection points" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iTGJfBgcANT3ijxCKkDPNZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Apple is expected to recover in 2025 with a low single-digit YoY shipment growth."</p><p>"This is based on the expectations of the introduction of a satellite messaging feature in Apple’s Watch Ultra 3 in 2025 and the anticipated launch of the Watch SE 3 with an upgraded design."</p><p>Jain also points out that with the rising adoption of Wear OS, we could expect advanced health monitoring features, improved battery life, and greater emphasis on personalization and customization.</p><p>For instance, the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4#section-google-pixel-watch-4-rumors-and-patents">Pixel Watch</a> could see a "rounded-edge bezel turned into a squeezable, touch-sensitive control interface," along with a smartwatch "Fit Score" that informs the user of the"differences in wrist size, skin color, hair density, BMI, fat percentage, and the likes."</p><p>Integrating AI into their products could also push sales in the right direction. With more comprehensive health-tracking analysis combined with powerful hardware, like "health sensors for measuring bodily signals such as serious heart health tracking, focusing on atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, hypertension, and diabetes to sustain their position in the market," Jain explained.</p>

<p>Samsung's long <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> delays have affected every part of the processes, from the beta testing stages to the confirmation of exactly which Galaxy phones and tablets will support the new operating system. The South Korean company has provided a bit more clarity on device support in recent weeks, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/sg/samsung-electronics-singapore-announces-official-rollout-of-one-ui-7-from-14-april" target="_blank">post</a> today, March 20, on the Samsung Newsroom in Singapore — adding 15 new models to the list (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-update-for-more-galaxy-devices/" target="_blank">SammyGuru</a>).</p><p>Previous announcements from Samsung revealed that in addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, which debuted with One UI 7, the older Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S23 lineups would support the upgrade. On top of that, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, Galaxy Z Flip 6, Galaxy Z Fold 5, and Galaxy Z Fold 6 would also be supported. The same goes for the Galaxy Tab S9 and Galaxy Tab S10 series.</p><p>Now, the list of supported One UI 7 devices expands to a total of 34 models, including the following new additions:</p>
<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy S22</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S8</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Plus</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite</li></ul>
<p>Notably, the expanded list adds the Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S21 series, as well as two more generations of older Samsung foldables. The press release notes that the rollout for One UI 7 will begin on April 14 for these devices in Singapore.</p>

<hr>
<p>Huawei's latest phone launch is here and it's truly walking the line between foldable designs.</p><p>The Chinese OEM debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/pura-x/">the Pura X</a> foldable phone today (Mar. 20); however, the device seemingly teeters between clamshell and bookstyle foldable designs (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633159/huawei-pura-x-flip-phone-wide-1610-aspect-ratio-harmonyos-next">The Verge</a>). When folded, the Pura X looks like your standard clamshell foldable; however, you'll note that the hinge is to the left, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. On the front, the Pura X features a 3.5-inch OLED display with a max 120Hz refresh rate and a 1440 Hz high-frequency <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>.</p><p>Above that rounded corner square cover screen is the Pura X's triple camera array. The horizontal housing features a 50MP primary lens with f/1.6 aperture and OIS (optical image stabilization). This is joined by a 40MP ultra-wide angled lens and an 8MP telephoto lens.</p><p>Opening the Pura X is where things take a more book-style turn as Huawei provided it with an immersively wide 6.3-inch OLED display with a 16:10 aspect ratio. The company states it features 2,500nits of peak brightness and 1,440Hz PWM dimming.</p><p>Huawei really doubles down on the width and broadness of this foldable's display, stating users can enjoy such a view in landscape or portrait mode. For viewing videos, Huawei says users can experience a "broad field of vision" when in landscape and even gaming. However, going vertical sees "pictures and text displayed more widely with clear content."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1457px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="tauUF6wtT777xzPyBUGdgm" name="huawei-pura-x-foldable-white-example" alt="The Huawei Pura X foldable in white, showcasing its cover display and internal screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tauUF6wtT777xzPyBUGdgm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1457" height="820" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pura X contains a wide variety of Huawei's AI and HarmonyOS software. The cover display features alternating "intelligent lighting effects," the ability to turn photos into stickers on the lock screen, and cute/interactive pets. Users can also use the camera in the phone's folded state for sharp selfies and more. Huawei also added its in-house AI assistant, Pangu, via Harmony Intelligence. As The Verge notes, this is the first of its phones to do so.</p><p>Huawei's latest device boasts <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huawei-devices-are-losing-support-for-android-apps-heres-why-its-a-good-thing">HarmonyOS Next</a> (OS 5). One of the main highlights of this software is its notable lack of Android app support. The company discussed this new vision of its software in 2024, stating it would be built on its own custom architecture instead of the Android Open Source Project.</p><p>Internally, the Pura X steps up its cooling game with the " ultra-cold three-dimensional cooling system." Huawei says this technology improves the phone's heat dissipation and efficiency. What's more, the foldable contains a 4,720mAh battery with 66W wired charging. Those purchasing it in China will find 12GB of RAM and the choice of 256GB and 512GB internal storage. Moreover, the Collector's Edition takes things up to 16/512GB and 16/1TB.</p><p>The Huawei Pura X starts at 7,499 yuan (~$1,034) in Stylish Red, Stylish Green, Moon Shadow Gray, Zero White, and Phantom Night Black. For now, the phone remains restricted to the Chinese market. There's no word when/if it will make its way overseas.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing has been spotted sending out a saddening email to its consumers today (Mar. 20) about its recent smartphone launch.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evowizz/status/1902658736096715098?">Dylan Roussel</a> on X drew attention to the unexpected Nothing Community email for users who pre-ordered the Phone 3a Pro (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/your-nothing-3a-pro-preorder-may-take-longer-to-arrive/">Android Police</a>). According to Nothing, those who've pre-purchased the latest 3a Pro will receive their devices sometime in mid-April. The email states the devices will be "shipped before April 15."</p><p>The email adds that the delay is "due to demand," meaning a lot of others have been trying to get their hands on it and forced Nothing to slow things down. The company states it will continue to keep its consumers updated on the status of their pre-ordered Nothing Phone 3a Pro until it ships in mid-April.</p><p>The publication claims this delay will impact consumers in Europe more than other regions where Nothing's phone is available. It seems those in Spain and the U.S. are still on schedule, though color availability varies for the former.</p><p>It'll be worth keeping an eye on your email just as a precaution to ensure you're up to date on the status of your pre-ordered Phone 3a Pro.</p>

<p>Nothing generated a lot of hype with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro launch</a> during MWC 2025. While the duo picked up six years of "essential" updates and loads of new Nothing AI software, one of the standouts is the sheer upgraded camera arrays. Nothing also included a new physical button, the Essential Key, to produce its AI hub "Essential Spaces." From there, users will have full access to their device's AI features like voice notes, saved content, and more.</p><p>The Phone 3a runs for $379 while the Pro version goes for $459. However, it's worth noting that both devices are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.nothing.tech/">currently sold out</a> in the U.S., leaving Nothing's expected restock to take place "within 2 months" for the Phone 3a.</p><p>Interestingly, Nothing was quick to begin updating and refining its Phone 3a Pro experience with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-3a-pro-gains-first-update-ahead-of-release">pre-launch OTA update</a> ten days ago (on Mar. 10). The company focused on the cameras by giving users a way to access camera presets, as well as the option of sharing those with others. The Essential Spaces also grabbed a QoL update that lets users save what's on the screen and add a note/voice recording when saving it.</p>

<ul><li>Google appears to be prepping a new Google Messages feature that will let you delete RCS chats remotely.</li><li>The feature will only work on newer devices updated to support the latest RCS Universal Profile.</li><li>You'll be able to delete RCS chats for everyone within 15 minutes after originally sending the message.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> looks poised to borrow a key iMessage feature in a future update: deleting RCS chats for everyone. Currently, if you delete an RCS chat in Google Messages, it'll only remove it from your device. Anyone else that has already received the message will keep it, which isn't good enough for awkward texting mishaps. This might be changing soon, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/rcs-delete-sent-texts-3536278/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has discovered what could be the user-interface for remote chat deletion in a Google Messages beta.</p><p>Android Authority found the UI by scouring through the <strong>messages.android_20250317_01_RC00.phone.openbeta_dynamic</strong> APK release. Although the publication notes that the feature isn't publicly accessible, it did manage to discover a new deletion option in this Google Messages version.</p><p>It's called "Delete for everyone," and allows users to remotely delete RCS chats. Like the "unsend" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-get-imessage-android">iMessage feature</a>, Google Messages notes that "messages may still be seen by others on older app versions." As such, this feature will become most useful not when it publicly releases, but months or years later as Android users move to new Google Messages versions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1870px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.94%;"><img id="Xme2AC9Jw8gp2Zpf3oFVEn" name="Google-Messages-RCS-Delete" alt="Deleting RCS chats for everyone with Google Messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xme2AC9Jw8gp2Zpf3oFVEn.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1870" height="1364" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When a message is deleted, a placeholder bubble will appear in the chat that reads "Message deleted." Unlike typical messages, there isn't a white or colored background for this bubble. Instead, it's clear and shows the background color of your conversation.</p><p>There are a few limitations to remote message deletion for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS chats</a> in Google Messages. For starters, older devices won't be able to participate, since the feature utilizes a newer version of the RCS Universal Profile. Additionally, you can only delete a message for everyone within the first 15 minutes after it's been sent.</p><p>If you delete a chat after the 15-minute time limit has expired, it'll only be deleted from your device. There's also an option to only delete a chat from your device within the time threshold. It's unclear when or if Google might release this feature, but it is clearly in development.</p>

<ul><li>Google confirmed in a statement that its Pixel 9a features an older Exynos modem that previously gave other Pixels issues.</li><li>The device rocks the Exynos 5300 modem which, per reports from 2023, gave Pixel 8 users quite the headache with bad reception and battery drain issues.</li><li>It also looks like the Pixel 9a lacks satellite connectivity as the newer Exynos 5400 modem in the flagship Pixel 9 series contains such support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly delivering confirmation on a specification change for its recent budget Pixel.</p><p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9a-modem-3535985/">Android Authority</a>, Google has reportedly confirmed that it is not using the same Samsung Exynos modem inside the Pixel 9a. The device is stated to use the Exynos 5300 modem with the Tensor G4 chipset instead of the newer Exynos 5400 — like the rest of the Pixel 9 series. While there are (typically) some downgrades expected when you swap to more affordability, this one might impact consumers.</p><p>As the publication notes, the Exynos 5400 modem was sought after due to its improvements over the 5300 version. Specifically, it boosted a phone's cellular reception, battery life, and a few internal heating problems. This could cause some issues as the post reiterates problems the Pixel 6 series had with the same Exynos 5300 modem.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">surge of reports from users</a> with a Pixel 8 series model also voiced severe issues with this older modem in 2023. Many of the reports saw users complain about connectivity and overheating issues with that older modem. There was a problematic battery draining issue when using mobile data, which saw the 5300 as the main culprit.</p><p>Users in 2023 said they could barely squeeze five hours out of their Pixel 8 before they needed to charge.</p>

<p>During the era of Pixel 9 rumors, the Exynos 5400 modem was brought up and within that conversation was the topic of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">a new connectivity option</a>. Samsung outfitted the Exynos 5400 with support for 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN). In short, that's satellite connectivity. Those early rumors claimed the newer modem was not only faster but also more power efficient, potentially solving those battery drain issues.</p><p>When it came to Pixel 9a rumors, this new modem <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-modem-tensor-g4-rumored-changes">wasn't mentioned</a>. In its place was the Exynos 5300 modem — which we've now seen confirmed to be true today.</p><p>This development could also impact a major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-wireless/verizon-satellite-texting-us-customers-first-select-phones">announcement from Verizon</a>: the existence of satellite texting support for its U.S. customers. The cellular provider announced yesterday (Mar. 19) that it is starting to roll out satellite texting support in the U.S. for Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 phones, meaning its customers will be the first to have such an ability.</p><p>There were concerns about whether or not the Pixel 9a was involved and it seems the budget phone is left out, given the Exynos 5300's lack of satellite support.</p>

<p>Meta's Oculus Publishing initiative led to 100 new games in 2024, but the $50 million Horizon Worlds creator fund has led to criticisms — including from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-its-time-to-kill-horizon-worlds-before-it-kills-the-meta-quest">my colleague Nick Sutrich</a> — that Meta isn't prioritizing traditional developers anymore.</p><p>Pruett responded that they still have 200 titles in active development through Oculus Publishing. They also are funding 21 developers through the Ignition program, which they announced at GDC 2024 to support laid-off developers.</p><p>He did admit that Oculus Publishing is now looking for a "very different" type of content targeting new audiences — more on that later — but as the head of content for the biggest VR platform in the world, Pruett used his GDC 2025 platform to reassure developers that they shouldn't assume the Meta money well has dried up. Nor should they feel forced to target teens.</p>

<p>Other "theories" Pruett set out to debunk at GDC were that Meta had shifted its priorities from paid apps to free-to-play in-app payments (F2P IAPs) or that revenue had fallen because Meta opened up its store to App Lab titles.</p><p>Pruett said they did a substantial "data analysis" to determine the shift in its users' purchases. They found that most users buy a ton of games after they first unbox their VR headset but then never return to the Quest Store to browse, except when "off-platform advertising" draws them to one specific title. Store placement doesn't matter, except in the peak moments like Black Friday and Christmas when Quest activations spike.</p><p>Teens are more active Quest users year-round, but they're much more "price sensitive" and, like adults, tend to let external sources like streamers, influencers, and friends dictate what they're willing to try.</p><p>Overall, Pruett said, "paid apps are still the majority of our revenue on the platform by an overwhelming margin." F2P IAPs have steadily climbed, but they're not necessarily stealing money from customers who used to buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">critically acclaimed Quest titles</a>. Instead, the old VR guard isn't spending as consistently as it used to, and the new customer base skews younger and prefers "meme games" to emotional AAA titles.</p><p>He pointed to internal Meta data that the opened app store and Horizon Worlds push in the mobile app decreased Quest Store profits by "<1%" and "3%," respectively, while overall store profits climbed by 12% in 2024. So, in Pruett's mind, the impact of these changes was "very small," even if individual developers saw declines.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7jgSq9Y4iAqx6bCEV6h2Nn" name="animal-company-official-screenshot" alt="An official press screenshot of two different gameplay moments showing silly cartoonish characters interacting with one another in Animal Company on Meta Quest 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7jgSq9Y4iAqx6bCEV6h2Nn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Games like Animal Company dominate the most popular games category on the Quest Store. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Wooster Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I did, in hindsight, find Pruett's argument flawed. Turning the Quest Store from a curated experience into a free-for-all Steam-like that prioritizes Horizon Worlds obviously impacted <em>some</em> developers; the fact that new developers have swept in to claim record profits doesn't refute the fact that other games that would once have stood out are now instantly buried.</p><p>Opening up the Quest Store was the right decision to find fresh indie content for a younger audience. But Pruett's analysis doesn't consider the reason <em>why</em> older VR gamers aren't coming back to the Quest Store after unboxing their Quest — presumably, because it's overwhelmingly bloated and because the top-selling titles skew towards the teen audience.</p><p>Meta does recognize this fact, even if it doesn't take ownership of developers' struggles. It's hiring more people to improve the Quest Store, improving personalized recommendations and game filter options, and revamping game pages to allow devs to share user-generated content and social media posts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LMZ5LYKbriqDcXAMD676md" name="meta-horizon-worlds-meta-quest-3-quest-3s" alt="A Meta Quest 3 and a Meta Quest 3S headset on a table with a Horizon Worlds portal behind them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LMZ5LYKbriqDcXAMD676md.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For now, though, Pruett's talk makes clear that developers need to find alternative ways to reach audiences, not simply hope they stand out by quality and old successes.</p><p>During the Q&A, I asked Pruett if Meta is seeking alternative marketing methods outside of the Quest Store or if developers need to do this themselves. He answered that he sees Meta's biggest job as "increasing the amount of time people spend in the headset." Developers have a "much stronger lever" for keeping users invested in <em>specific</em> titles, but they need to look for alternatives to traditional Quest Store discoverability or buying ads.</p><p>The "big spikes in success" that many devs saw came "because they went viral on TikTok or on Instagram," Pruett said, and he thinks devs are "underleveraging" this resource.</p><p>He also pointed out how the devs behind games like Gorilla Tag and Animal Company have done a great job of building and managing a "robust community" on platforms like Discord, which allows them to pull users back into their game any time they announce an update.</p>

<p>Pruett's talk ran through the different demographics of VR gamers who bought Quests over the years, from PC VR power users to "VR Elites" who bought the Quest 2 and 3, ending with the current youth influx via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a>. These groups aren't going away, but Meta's internal data suggests a new demographic will grow substantially on Quest in the next few years: "mainstream adults."</p><p>For this group, Pruett says, gaming is a "secondary pastime." These "30-something dads" will see Meta Quest as a "really high-end TV." And "as the resolution of [Meta's] devices increases," using a headset as a TV replacement becomes more "viable."</p><p>While this group is small now, Meta predicts that by 2027, mainstream adults will be the next "major player" on Quest after the teen influx. That's why Pruett said developers shouldn't pivot to teen games to join Oculus Publishing. Instead, they want developers to start making content now for the "mainstream" non-gamer crowd in a couple of years.</p><p>I found this fascinating for one obvious reason: several leaks point to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> shipping in 2026. If Meta wants to court this new casual-streamer dad group, then I'd be shocked if Meta didn't try to boost the Quest 4 resolution enough to make it tempting as a TV alternative. Either that or try and make it light enough that it's more comfortable to wear for a 2-hour movie streaming session.</p>

<p>Speculation aside, this talk made it clear that Pruett wants to debunk the idea that Horizon Worlds, Gorilla Tag, and traditional Quest games can't co-exist.</p><p>"Our commitment to continuing to grow the ecosystem is unwavering, but we’re learning in real time," Pruett said. He urged developers to get in touch with Meta and share their experiences and expectations, and he remained optimistic that the Quest space will continue to evolve and grow — not just become a kid-dominated space where some devs can't profit.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to make the most of this Samsung deal, a trade-in is the way to go. Fortunately, the retailer is being pretty generous with the devices it accepts, giving out the full $900 of credit when you send in devices like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Z Fold 5. Even if you can&apos;t get the max discount, phones dating back to 2020&apos;s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra will ensure you $600 off, so dig up your old Samsung phones to see how much you can save.</p><p>If you can&apos;t swing the trade-in route, you&apos;ll still get $300 off the phone. That beats the current discounts offered by retailers like Amazon and Best Buy, and Samsung will even sweeten the deal by throwing in three free months of YouTube Premium and Peacock Premium streaming.</p><p>One big question remains: will the Galaxy S25 Ultra get a bigger discount when Amazon&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/amazon-big-spring-sale-deals-2025">Big Spring Sale</a> kicks off on March 25th? It&apos;s too soon to say, but if you&apos;ve had your eye on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and you&apos;re ready to buy today, I wouldn&apos;t wait. </p>

<p><em>Even with a discount, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a major investment.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google has equipped Pixel smartphones with its own in-house systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) for four generations. While the company designs the majority of Tensor processors, it doesn't make them; instead, it chooses to outsource the fabrication of these chips to Samsung Foundry. This year that may change, as the unannounced Tensor G5 SoC will reportedly be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).</p><p>TSMC is far and away the industry leader in semiconductor manufacturing, and the best smartphone processors — including the Apple A18 Pro and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> — use its flagship 3nm process node. Google will reportedly begin using TSMC's 3nm process to make its Tensor G5 processors, opening the door for big performance and quality improvements. But how big of a deal is it really to the average user?</p><p>This week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-google-built-tensor-g5-3535489/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> revealed a detailed component list for the Tensor G5 SoC, shedding light on the planned changes. According to the report, these are the supposed changes Google will make to Tensor chips, starting with the Tensor G5:</p>

<p>A switch from Samsung Foundry to TSMC should result in a few high-level benefits for Google. For starters, Samsung Foundry has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-next-gen-4nm-process-chip-production-reported">struggled to make smaller chips reliably at desirable yield rates</a>. Its issues designing 4nm and smaller chips have been well-documented, and it's reported that unfavorable yield rates are the reason <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">there isn't an Exynos-powered Samsung Galaxy S25 model</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, TSMC's advanced processors have been around longer, and its manufacturing processes are likely more reliable than those of Samsung Foundry. For instance, overheating was a key problem for Apple's A17 Pro chip, which was manufactured using TSMC's older 3nm process. It already worked out those kinks, and Google can reap the benefits with the Tensor G5.</p><p>As our own Jerry Hildenbrand recently unpacked, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nanometers-explained-why-node-size-matters">3nm processors can fit more components or run more efficiently</a> than larger SoCs. However, it's often the other kinds of engineering work that make a tangible difference. That's why Google's component swaps rumored for the Tensor G5 could make all the difference.</p>
<h2 id="what-may-change-with-the-tensor-g5-2">What may change with the Tensor G5</h2>

<p>Samsung-fabricated Tensor processors often use off-the-shelf components manufactured by the South Korean company to fill in the gaps between Google's custom designs. With the TSMC-fabricated Tensor G5, Google is taking the opportunity to design more of its own components.</p><p>The most eye-catching part of the leaked spec sheet is certainly the Google-design image-signal processor (ISP) set to become part of the Tensor G5 chip.</p>

<p>ISPs are responsible for processing the information coming in from a phone's camera lenses, and they are crucial to getting great-quality photos and videos. A bad ISP can cause excellent camera lenses to produce poor output and vice versa. As such, we might be able to expect better photos and videos from the same camera hardware with the Tensor G5 chip and beyond.</p><p>Older Pixel phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4-powered Pixel 9</a>, used Samsung-designed ISPs with small Google tweaks. Now that Google is purportedly developing a custom ISP from start to finish, it's likely that future Pixel flagships will have hardware and software stacks that are better optimized, at least where the cameras are concerned.</p><p>Additionally, Google is reportedly replacing Samsung-made controllers — like the USB and display controllers — with licensed parts from companies such as Synaptics. This could give the company more or less flexibility in tweaking and optimizing how they work with Pixel hardware, depending on how they are implemented.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m7ZEgmEamVVUGYiDhqRRzj" name="google-pixel-9-pro-obsidian-and-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-display-02.jpg" alt="Comparing the display sizes of the Google Pixel 9 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m7ZEgmEamVVUGYiDhqRRzj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The reason why you might think a switch to TSMC isn't a big deal is that there are a few major holdovers from the Samsung Foundry era. While the GPU included in the Tensor G5 is predicted to be the Imagination Technologies DXT, the CPU will still feature Arm Cortex cores. Aside from the bump that comes with moving from a 4nm to a 3nm process, that means the Tensor G5 could perform similarly to older generations.</p><p>The Tensor G5's audio processor, memory controller, digital signal processor, and tensor processing unit will all still be custom components designed by Google. The latter two components are tabbed to be next-generation versions specifically for the Tensor G5. As the TPU handles AI-based tasks, this could be a sign that the Tensor G5 in the Google Pixel 10 may be able to handle more AI operations on-device.</p><p>With all these holdovers, plus the same USB3 controller, it's not like Google is completely starting over with the Tensor G5 chip.</p>

<p>I'm optimistic that the switch from Samsung Foundry to TSMC could give Google more flexibility in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">designing future Tensor chips</a>, including the Tensor G5, that are better optimized for Pixel phones. While it's true that Google would likely still use off-the-shelf components for some parts of the SoC, it would have more flexibility in choosing which components are best fit for Pixel hardware needs. Previously, Tensor chips seemed to default to Samsung components when a third-party option was needed.</p><p>For example, the pulse-width modulation (PWM) controller in the Tensor G5 is said to be the Faraday Technologies FTPWMTMR010. Those who aren't PWM-sensitive might not notice such a small tweak, but Pixel phones are known for having extremely low PWM frequencies. These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">can cause pain and headaches for a portion of the population</a>, and the switch from a Samsung controller to a Faraday Technologies controller could give Google the flexibility to natively offer higher PWM rates — or disable PWM altogether.</p><p>It's unclear whether Google would do something like this, but that's the dream scenario for a move such as this one. Ideally, the switch from Samsung Foundry to TSMC could give Google the flexibility to identify problems with its hardware and correct them, either with off-the-shelf parts or custom components. If Google can take these kinds of steps, we'll look back on the Tensor G5 switch as a turning point for Pixel hardware.</p>

Headlining the trio is the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, coming more than a year after its predecessor was released. It promises to provide a 30% CPU boost and an almost 30% jump to the GPU, which is nice on paper and probably in practice.</p><p>Of course, these weren't the only announcements, as we also saw AYANEO, OneXSugar, and Retroid announce new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>. AYANEO's introduction of the Pocket S2 comes as little surprise, seeing the original Pocket S was the first device to ship with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/snapdragon-g-series-chips">Snapdragon G3x Gen 2</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2077px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hgyhmPELrZSy6XZAPzs54g" name="ayaneo-pocket-s2-promo-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket S2 front view render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgyhmPELrZSy6XZAPzs54g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2077" height="1168" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Until now, this operated as the most powerful chip for Android gaming handhelds, custom driver support notwithstanding. So naturally, I'm pretty darn excited to get my hands on the Pocket S2 and see whether the G3 Gen 3 performs as well as Qualcomm claims.</p><p>However, at the same time, I've had this nagging question in the back of my mind: have we reached the point of diminishing returns? It's kind of the same feeling that I have when it comes to smartphones, as I feel that slab phones have reached their peak, which drives my commitment to foldables.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="q9CNzMjcBt4AktGg2WqhbR" name="ps3-on-android-1" alt="Rayman on Pocket EVO with aPS3e on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9CNzMjcBt4AktGg2WqhbR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, I don't feel the same when it comes to the design of gaming handhelds, as there's a lot more flexibility. But I don't actually know if we need faster and more powerful processors. Don't get me wrong, if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">RPCS3 for Android</a> continues its breakneck pace in development and Winlator continues to improve; then this take will probably look pretty dumb.</p><p>Even with Nintendo doing everything it can to put a stop to Switch emulation, the fact that you can use Android to play PS3, Switch, and PC games is mind-blowing. But in order to take advantage of that, you'll need to pony up a pretty penny.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ir7p2QejToTJEwZyayzmAK" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-review-4.jpg" alt="Echoes of Wisdom on the Ayaneo Pocket S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ir7p2QejToTJEwZyayzmAK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the AYANEO Pocket S Indiegogo campaign <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-pre-orders">started</a>, you were looking at a starting price of $399 for the 1080p base model. Currently, you can't actually buy the base model Pocket S, but before it went out of stock, you'd be looking at $559. You might know where I'm going with this, but that's more expensive than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-vs-steam-deck-lcd-what-are-the-differences">512GB Steam Deck OLED</a>, which is quite a bit more capable than the Pocket S.</p><p>At the same time, there's AYN with its Odin 2 lineup of Android gaming handhelds, all of which are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. The trio of Odin 2 models offers a variety of RAM configurations, but the base model can currently be had for $299.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3940px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="U6ywQvQqGi6QM44pPCG8oY" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-review-1.jpg" alt="Fallout 4 running on the Ayaneo Pocket S with the Steam Deck OLED" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6ywQvQqGi6QM44pPCG8oY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3940" height="2216" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right now, the company's latest handheld, the Odin 2 Portal with OLED, starts at $329. Even if you opt for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-2-portal-announced">Odin 2 Portal (Max)</a>, with its 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, its $499 price tag is still less than the entry-level Pocket S.</p><p>This is what worries me a bit about the status of high-end Android emulation. AYANEO didn't share pricing specifics for the Pocket S2, but considering that it's arriving with a brand-new Qualcomm chip, I suspect it'll be pretty darn expensive. And while a few design tweaks have been made, there's really not much of a compelling reason to get one unless you're a specs snob like me.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3854px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aF4s984cKZgjsdKvs8eW6K" name="retroid-pocket-flip-2-gc-teaser-render" alt="Retroid Pocket Flip 2 GC teaser render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aF4s984cKZgjsdKvs8eW6K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3854" height="2168" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't know whether the Pocket S2 will tip the scales in one direction or the other. I think that the onus is being put on what the numbers look like with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/retroid-pocket-flip-2-launch">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/retroid-pocket-classic-launch">Pocket Classic</a>.</p><p>The former is actually using the Snapdragon 865 from 2019, while the Classic is the first device to ship with the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2. Those are much more affordable, as Retroid is offering a bundle that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">includes both handhelds for under $330</a>. Sure, they don't have the juice to play through your PS3 library, but you're still getting an incredible experience regardless.</p><p>I'll be interested to see just how everything plays out and whether this new wave of Android handhelds brings more people into the hobby. It's wild enough to see niche companies partner with Qualcomm, but this might just be the start of something much bigger.</p>

I'm not kidding — even the packaging is similar to the iPad Air, and my wife just assumed it was the new iPad and not a Xiaomi tablet. Heck, even the keyboard accessory has the exact same design as the Magic Keyboard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VS9MivpCYt5GJZu9qCqMoE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VS9MivpCYt5GJZu9qCqMoE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pad 7 costs just ₹27,999 ($324) in India, which is a downright bargain when you consider the hardware on offer. The same model is available for £369 ($477) in the U.K., and while it is still affordable, it isn't quite as good a value — I'd suggest getting the OLED-based Honor MagicPad 2 instead.</p><p>To put things into context, the iPad Air retails for ₹59,990 ($694), which is more than double the price of the Pad 7. At £599 ($775) in the U.K., it isn't twice as high as the Pad 7 in the country, but there's still a sizable gulf between the two products.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vHRSpjjQNVohwBnfZ5K8NE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHRSpjjQNVohwBnfZ5K8NE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's incredulous to me that Xiaomi was able to emulate the design of the iPad Air to such a level. Yes, I know there are only so many ways you can design a tablet with a flat profile, but the resemblance between the two is uncanny, and it's clear this is what Xiaomi set out to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3npS79XNvFfaE95FnpbBnE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3npS79XNvFfaE95FnpbBnE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pad 7 has flat sides, and coming in at 6.2mm, it is just 0.1mm thicker than the iPad Air — the difference isn't noticeable when using both products next to one another. It is 40g heavier at 500g, but you get a bigger 8,850mAh battery. The build quality is just as good, and the tablet has an aluminum construction with a balanced heft.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zhvoJzUDzoHXUUtMQpTekE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhvoJzUDzoHXUUtMQpTekE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where Xiaomi scores an advantage is the panel; the Pad 7 has a 11.2-inch IPS LCD panel, but it goes up to 144Hz, and the high refresh immediately makes a difference. It's annoying that the iPad Air misses out on this mode; the tablet is limited to 60Hz, and only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro</a> models hit 120Hz.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EGLWgKP3wVqqQjbh5SsePE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EGLWgKP3wVqqQjbh5SsePE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the Pad 7 gets brighter with HDR content; this is only evident while streaming content via Netflix or YouTube, but it makes the tablet a great choice for consuming multimedia. There's a good amount of customizability when it comes to adjusting the colors, and while it isn't an OLED, you get good color vibrancy and contrast levels. There's a reading mode as well, and I made good use of it in the month I tested the Pad 7.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Vozi47LcR5THbeJGLedBFE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vozi47LcR5THbeJGLedBFE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pad 7 has decent internals thanks to the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3, but it doesn't come anywhere close to the Apple M3. Apple's silicon is leagues ahead of everything else, and the iPad Air does an incredible job with console-quality games. While the Pad 7 does a good job in its own right when it comes to gaming, it struggles with demanding titles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sQgdgoMhYN43ddJeE4V3qE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sQgdgoMhYN43ddJeE4V3qE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With quad audio drivers and good tuning, the Pad 7 delivers great onboard sound, and it does a terrific job while streaming TV shows and gaming. You get 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage with the base model, and that's good enough, if a little annoying that the 128GB model uses UIFS 3.1 storage. Xiaomi also sells the tablet with 256GB of storage, and that configuration uses UFS 4.0 storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mjh6eDt5C85r3PdS6rCfKE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjh6eDt5C85r3PdS6rCfKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn't much missing with connectivity; the tablet has Wi-Fi 6e, Bluetooth 5.4, and uses the USB-C 3.2 standard. The 8,850mAh battery lasts longer than the iPad Air, and there's 67W charging, with the tablet taking just over 90 minutes to charge the battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dABLD7AzAMEfvWHLPLzMoE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dABLD7AzAMEfvWHLPLzMoE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big part of what makes the iPad Air great is the vast accessory ecosystem, and Xiaomi is trying to emulate that with the Pad 7. The tablet comes with two accessories — the Focus Keyboard and Focus Pen — and they're both pretty decent. The keyboard accessory has a floating mechanism that's similar to the Magic Keyboard. In fact, the design is identical to the Magic Keyboard, down to the style of the hinge at the bottom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g88oG2DSfxKnLXC3qhVFFE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g88oG2DSfxKnLXC3qhVFFE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The keys have good travel, and while the keyboard on the whole is good, it doesn't quite have the same quality as the Magic Keyboard. Same with the stylus; while it is decent, it doesn't come close to the Apple Pencil.</p>
<h2 id="ultimately-it-s-all-about-the-value-2">Ultimately, it's all about the value</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="unCH69hgR7iiaZpytqkGJE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/unCH69hgR7iiaZpytqkGJE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pad 7 comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and the software is pretty good. Xiaomi needs to overhaul the visuals, but the interface is fluid, and it is packed with features, including useful multitasking modes. But the biggest issue is that the software isn't anywhere as extensible as the iPad Air; the reason I use the iPad is the software ecosystem, and whether it's image or video editing tools, drawing utilities, or music production software, iPadOS has a distinct advantage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xFZaLY8VQpenjwsKBtwJFE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFZaLY8VQpenjwsKBtwJFE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That doesn't mean the Pad 7 is a bad choice; if you need a tablet to consume media and get some work done on the go, it is still a good option. It's just not as powerful as the iPad Air, but that's a criticism I can level to pretty much any Android tablet. On that note, the Pad 7 won't get as many software updates either, and Xiaomi usually tends to drag its feet in this regard anyway.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="f6KCSBuoi8XLLz7BxoJdKE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f6KCSBuoi8XLLz7BxoJdKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, Xiaomi did all the right things with the Pad 7. While the design is unmissably similar to the iPad Air, there is enough differentiation on the hardware — particularly the panel — to make the tablet stand out. Also, there's no arguing that it is a much better value, and at under $400, it is one of the better choices available if you need an Android tablet.</p>

<p>Why do smartphones have odd camera bumps when they could just have a larger battery and a flat back instead? That's the question that Google seems to answer with the Google Pixel 9a, a midranger with a 5,100mAh battery capacity and a uniform 8.9mm thickness. In some ways, Apple's latest midrange offering — the iPhone 16e — is the polar opposite of the Pixel 9a. So, how do they compare?</p><p>While some will prefer the 6.1-inch compact form factor of the iPhone 16e compared to the 6.3-inch Pixel 9a, that's where the advantages start and end. It starts at $599, putting it above the sub-$500 midrange Pixel. And despite costing less, the Google Pixel 9a seems to offer a lot more features. Let's break down the pros and cons of purchasing each just-released smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-iphone-16e-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. iPhone 16e: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="XFSdkoSwZq3cScHznhJeYB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-on-grass" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a laying back-up on a mossy surface next to a plant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XFSdkoSwZq3cScHznhJeYB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing I've always loved about Pixel phones is how identifiable they are, largely thanks to the unique camera bar. It's been a part of Pixel design language for multiple generations now, but it goes to the wayside with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Google Pixel 9a</a>. Instead, the Pixel 9a has a nearly flat composite plastic back with a slight bump for the camera lenses. The dual-camera system is positioned asymmetrically on the left side of the rear case.</p><p>It's an interesting look, likely designed to maximize internal space. However, it results in the Pixel 9a losing some of its character, and some Pixel fans might not like it. The side rails of the device use a satin metal finish, and there's a Gorilla Glass 3 covering on the front. The entire phone is protected with an IP68 dust and water-resistance rating.</p><p>In terms of size, the Pixel 9a measures 154.7mm x 73.3mm x 8.9mm, which is technically the same thickness as the Pixel 8a. It's important to remember that unlike the Pixel 8a, the new Pixel 9a is nearly 8.9mm thick at every point due to the lack of a camera bar. It's on the heavier side, too, weighing 185.9 grams.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> is similarly minimalistic, with a rectangular design and curved corners joined by a singular rear camera. While it does have a camera bump, it's still smaller than the Pixel 9a in every way. The iPhone 16e measures 146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.80mm and weighs just 167 grams. This will make the iPhone 16e feel notably more compact and lightweight than the Pixel 9a, which will be preferred by some.</p><p>The iPhone 16e also arguably features more premium materials, with a glass back and aluminum side rails.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-display-lock-screen" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in the photographer's hand.

<p>Looking past the large bezels, the Pixel 9a has a few key display advantages. It's larger, with a 6.3-inch pOLED panel that can switch between 60Hz and 120Hz as needed. It also has a 1080 x 2424 resolution and an impressive 2,700-nit peak brightness rating. All told, with all that and HDR support, the Google Pixel 9a should look great in most situations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the iPhone 16e is objectively using dated display technology. It finally uses an OLED display but is still limited to 60Hz refresh rates. The brightness isn't great either, with a 1,200-nit peak brightness rating. Unlike newer iPhones, the iPhone 16e doesn't have a Dynamic Island and instead uses a fairly large notch. It looks gargantuan compared to the small hole-punch cutout on the Pixel 9a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="u4vj4uieypnqPF7tvBLr6e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4vj4uieypnqPF7tvBLr6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a whole, the iPhone 16e has the clear advantage of being smaller and lighter than the Pixel 9a. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 9a seems to use its extra space wisely with a better display than its Apple competitor.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk-3" alt="All four Google Pixel 9a phones in each color (Iris, Peony, Porcelain, and Obsidian) placed artistically against or in front of a wooden display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Google Pixel 9a and iPhone 16e make sacrifices to hit their lower price points, but which is the more complete package?</p><p>The two phones are very similar in terms of their processor, with the Pixel 9a using the Tensor G4 chip and the iPhone 16e using the A18 chip. While the Tensor G4 processor is a worse performer than Apple's top chip, the A18 system-on-a-chip (SoC) in the iPhone 16e is a binned version with one fewer graphics core.</p><p>By comparison, the Tensor G4 in the Pixel 9a is the same one found throughout the rest of the Pixel 9 series. The Apple A18 SoC could still perform better in benchmarks, but both devices will be capable of daily use. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 chip</a> helps the Pixel 9a secure the software advantage with tons of Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features. On top of that, the Pixel 9a gets seven years of full OS upgrades and feature drops.</p>

<p>Both phones are expected to be battery champions, but the Pixel 9a is almost certainly the winner in capacity. It now sports a 5,100mAh battery that can last up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver enabled, according to Google. Apple says the iPhone 16e can go for 26 hours of video playback but doesn't share the exact capacity. Due to the iPhone 16e using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apples-c1-modem-in-the-iphone-16e-is-proof-that-we-dont-need-qualcomm-for-5g">Apple's first C1 cellular modem</a>, battery life is expected to be better than iPhones with Qualcomm modems.</p><p>Neither midranger has excellent charging speeds. Oddly, the iPhone 16e doesn't even support MagSafe or Qi2, meaning it is limited to slow Qi wireless charging with no magnetic alignment. The Google Pixel 9a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/does-the-google-pixel-9a-support-qi2-wireless-charging">similarly doesn't support Qi2</a> and tops out at just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-fast-is-the-google-pixel-9a-charging-speed">23W wired charging speeds</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-camera-bar" alt="A close-up of the top of the Porcelain Google Pixel 9a, focused on the camera cutout with buttons and the Google logo visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple markets the iPhone 16e's singular rear camera as a "do-it-all" sensor that can mimic a main, telephoto, and ultrawide camera. Is that really the case? The 48MP single camera has a f/1.6 aperture and can take 2x zoom photos at optical quality with sensor crop. Anything beyond that, though, and you're using lossy digital zoom. As such, this camera might leave something to be desired for those who enjoy dedicated ultrawide and telephoto lenses.</p><p>On the front, the iPhone 16e provides a 12MP, f/1.9 camera that will be more than capable for all your selfie and video recording needs. It can even shoot 4K video at up to 60FPS, for instance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hAxgw9UXYHntcU5neuKQ4e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hAxgw9UXYHntcU5neuKQ4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google uses two camera lenses on the Pixel 9a: a 48 MP wide camera and a 13MP ultrawide camera. Like the iPhone 16e, the Pixel 9a doesn't have a true telephoto camera and instead uses "Super Res Zoom" to enhance the digital zoom quality up to 8x. Beyond that, the smartphone falls back to digital zoom. Unlike the iPhone 16e, the Pixel 9a's dedicated ultrawide lens will let users take shots with a wider field of view.</p><p>The front-facing camera is a 13MP, f/2.2 lens with a 96.1-degree field of view. Notably, the Pixel 9a supports more advanced camera features than ever, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography support</a> for the first time.</p>

<p>Google's redesign of the Pixel 9a is somewhat controversial, and not everyone is going to like the new design. Setting that aside for a minute, it's impressive how many features Google managed to cram into a phone at this price point. At a time when Apple, Samsung, and OnePlus are all selling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">new midrangers</a> above the $500 threshold, Google is keeping the Pixel A-series phone just under it. That's an advantage that neither the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> nor the iPhone 16e have.</p><p>With that being said, the Pixel 9a is over a millimeter thicker than the iPhone 16e. It's bigger by every dimension, too. For the person that considers iOS an essential feature and prefers a compact phone, the iPhone 16e could be worth considering.</p>

<p>If there's one phone that gives the Pixel 9a stiff competition, it's the OnePlus 13R. Even with a price increase of $100 in the U.S. over the 12R, it still represents amazing value for what it offers. In this Pixel 9a vs. OnePlus 13R comparison, one thing is obvious: the 9a is geared more toward AI, while the 13R is focused on performance.</p><p>There are a few other notable differences, too, like the more compact design and longer software support for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixel 9a</a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 13R</a> has a bigger battery and extra telephoto camera. With deals happening on both phones, you might find them at similar prices at some point, so which one do you pick?</p>

<p>If you have small hands or have an affinity for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact phones</a>, you'll be drawn to the Pixel 9a. Due to the smaller display, the phone is a lot more pocketable than the 13R. It's also noticeably lighter at 186 grams. The lightweight can be partly attributed to the polycarbonate back panel. The 9a also has more pronounced rounded edges in all four corners, which should make it easier to handle.</p><p>That said, both devices feature pretty flat designs, which is something we've seen with more smartphones recently.</p><p>The Pixel 9a comes in the standard colors of Obsidian and Porcelain, as well as Peony and Iris. The OnePlus 13R only comes in two colors: Nebula Noir (black) and Astral Trail (cream). At 206 grams, it's a lot heavier than the 9a and larger, too, due to the massive display.</p><p>The Pixel 9a finally gets upgraded to an IP68 rating for improved water resistance. The 13R is only IP65 rated, which means it has the same dust resistance, but ingress protection is limited to "low-pressure water jets" only.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-oneplus-13r-display-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. OnePlus 13R: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XqAacLBSCPjwupZijofZE" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XqAacLBSCPjwupZijofZE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a has a 6.3-inch Actua pOLED display with a Full-HD Plus resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of up to 2,700 nits. The bezels around the display are fairly thick, which is a typical trait of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a>. The 9a gets an outdated scratch protection of Gorilla Glass 3, which has been used for the past couple of generations of A series phones. The refresh rate can only vary between 60Hz to 120Hz, but nothing below.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R also has a flat display like the 9a, but it's proper flagship quality. It's a 6.78-inch screen with a higher 2,780 x 1,264 resolution, which pushes the pixel count to 450 ppi. It's also an LTPO AMOLED screen, which means the refresh rate can vary from 1Hz to 120Hz, thus helping save more power with features like always-on display. Scratch protection is also better with Gorilla Glass 7i, and it has a rated peak brightness of 4,500 nits.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-oneplus-13r-hardware-and-battery-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. OnePlus 13R: Hardware and battery</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TQnEqWaBnQXNhiqMn7iFGJ" name="oneplus-13R-white-black-side-alert-slider-01" alt="Comparing the white and black models of the OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQnEqWaBnQXNhiqMn7iFGJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google isn't increasing the price of the Pixel 9a, which means it starts at $499 for 128GB and $559 for 256GB. You still get 8GB RAM across variants, just like before. Plus, being a Google phone, you should be able to find good carrier deals, too, if you don't want to buy unlocked in the U.S..</p><p>The 9a uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> SoC, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-google-titan-m2-and-tensor-security-core-work">Titan M2</a> security chip. While it's not the most potent chip for heavy-duty tasks like gaming, it's more than capable of handling all the onboard AI features and casual gaming. It's certainly an improvement over the G3 that came before it.</p><p>For a small Pixel phone, the 9a will probably offer the best possible battery life. You get a pretty big 5,100mAh capacity, which Google says should last more than "30+ hours."</p><p>Fast charging is present, but it's not as quick compared to the 13R. The 9a can do up to 23W wired when using Google's 45W adapter. Wireless charging is capped at 7.5W with Qi-certified EPP chargers.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13R is available in just a single variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB storage for $599.99. It's currently hard to get a hold of from online retailers as of writing, so your only option may be OnePlus.com. You'll also have to buy this unlocked only in the U.S., as none of the carriers offer any subsidies on it.</p><p>The hardware is solid, though. The 13R has the very powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 from Qualcomm, which can easily take on the most stressful apps and games without breaking a sweat. Unfortunately, eSIM is one feature we found missing from the 13R, but the SIM slot can accept two SIM cards.</p><p>Battery life is insane, thanks to the beastly 6,000mAh capacity. In our review, the OnePlus 13R easily lasted two full days on one charge, which is pretty awesome. It misses out on wireless charging, but I don't think anyone will miss it since the phone supports 80W charging. Plus, you get the compatible charger in the box, which is not the case with the 9a.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-oneplus-13r-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. OnePlus 13R: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="cEQmVWxQzVzvRRiGuWPDaA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-camera-bar" alt="Close-up of the Peony Google Pixel 9a, focused on the camera cutout and LED." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEQmVWxQzVzvRRiGuWPDaA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R has an improved 50MP main sensor, which does a stellar job of capturing rich details and low noise in still photos. We didn't find the secondary cameras to be too impressive, though. The telephoto, while nice to have, can only do 2x optical zoom, so anything beyond that is still digital. The 16MP selfie camera is also okay and gets the job done.</p><p>The Pixel 9a lacks a telephoto, but I don't think that's a huge loss since Google is pretty good with its AI-backed processing of digital zoom. The 9a has a 48MP main camera and 13MP ultrawide. The 9a still supports features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus, </a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me,</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, which is the first on an A series phone. Selfies are handled by a 10.5MP sensor, which I'm sure would do just fine.</p><p>The 9a and 13R can both shoot up to 4K 60fps video with the rear camera. In terms of actual video quality and stabilization performance, we'll have to spend more time testing the 9a, but that's coming soon.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a supports seven years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates, which means you should be good until early 2032. This easily beats OnePlus' update commitment of four years. Thankfully, the phone launched in early 2025, so it comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review" target="_blank">Android 15</a> from the get-go.</p><p>It's hard to choose between the Pixel's and OnePlus' interface since they are both really good. The 9a has a clean, bloat-free interface and will always be the first to get any new Android upgrade. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features" target="_blank">OxygenOS 15</a> on the OnePlus 13R works pretty great, and there are many improvements that you'll love, especially if you're coming from an older OnePlus phone.</p><p>AI is not really the play for OnePlus, but there are a few useful AI features baked in, like AI Unblur and Reflection Eraser. Google is going all-in on AI, and the Pixel 9a supports nearly every AI feature found in the Pixel 9 series, including Reimagine and Add Me. Plus, with Google's Feature Drop updates, we could see more useful AI tools added in the future.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HqrWLy2Ro9cTHCgLrY4HcA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-iris-in-hand" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a held in hand, the photo taken downards to emphasize its color and size." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HqrWLy2Ro9cTHCgLrY4HcA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the majority of buyers in the U.S., the Pixel 9a is going to be the smarter choice. It should be more widely available, is cheaper, has longer software support, and is powerful enough to get by. The cameras, AI features, and wireless charging are also things that should swing votes in its favor.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R has undeniable value, but not in every country. In places like India, the 13R would probably be a better pick over the 9a, where Google's pricing strategy tends to be askew. Plus, if you want a phone for gaming, a larger and brighter screen, and insane battery life with equally insane charging speeds, the OnePlus 13R is the phone to buy.</p>

<p>At under $500, the new Google Pixel 9a looks to be one of the best value-focused midrangers available. It'll compete with higher-priced phones like the iPhone 16e and OnePlus 13R but also cheaper ones like the recently-released Nothing Phone 3a Pro. While the Phone 3a Pro might actually offer a better value proposition than the latest Pixel 9a, it works better in some regions than others.</p><p>For users in Europe or India, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro might edge out the Pixel 9a with its dedicated telephoto camera. But for everyone else, the Google Pixel 9a is more appealing, with full support for North American cellular bands. It also has a better processor, longer software support, and more AI features. Let's break down how these two midrange phones compare.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-nothing-phone-3a-pro-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Nothing Phone 3a Pro: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="e2CGEpmTeUEKiZkLGYtGXA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-top-down" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a held in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2CGEpmTeUEKiZkLGYtGXA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ironically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Google Pixel 9a</a> is the midrange smartphone with a design that could be better described as "nothing." With a nearly flat back and the recognizable Pixel camera bar gone, the Pixel 9a doesn't have many unique aspects of its design. It does come in four colors: Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony. The side rails feature a satin metal finish, and the back is made out of polycarbonate plastic.</p><p>Instead of having a thinner body and a protruding camera bar, Google made the entire Pixel 9a measure 8.9mm thick, filling the extra space with a bigger battery. The phone is still more compact than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a Pro</a> overall, as the Pixel 9a measures 154.7mm x 73.3mm x 8.9mm. However, it is noticeably thicker. At 185.9 grams, the Pixel 9a will feel significantly lighter in the hand than the Phone 3a Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro with LED lights enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Nothing Phone 3a Pro's looks aren't for everyone, it does appear to have a better design than the Pixel 9a. It features Nothing character elements like the lighted Glyph Interface and the transparent back cover. Then, there's the massive circular camera bump, which looks jarring at first but may grow on you over time. Really, these two phones' design language couldn't be more different. One is basic, and the other is striking.</p><p>With a 6.77-inch screen, the Phone 3a Pro is bigger overall than the Pixel 9a. Nothing's higher-end mid-ranger measures 163.52mm x 77.5mm x 8.39mm, meaning it somehow finds a way to remain thinner than Google's offering. At 211 grams, it's much heavier than the Pixel 9a. Google has the advantage in durability, with IP68 protection against dust and water ingress and Gorilla Glass 3 on the front. Meanwhile, the Phone 3a Pro has a lesser IP64 rating and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">Panda Glass covering</a>.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a has a 6.3-inch pOLED screen, and it's bigger and better than last year's model. The panel has a 1080 x 2424 resolution and can hit 120Hz refresh rates, but it isn't an LTPO display. That means it can't fluctuate smoothly between refresh rates — it can only switch between 60Hz and 120Hz. It's very bright, with 2,700 nits peak brightness.</p><p>By comparison, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro has a bigger screen than the Pixel 9a and uses a more advanced LTPO panel. It's a 6.77-inch LTPO OLED screen with a 2392 x 1080 resolution and HDR10 support. It beats out the Pixel 9a with 3,000 nits of peak brightness, too. For anyone with sensitive eyes, the Phone 3a Pro's 2160Hz PWM dimming will be appreciated.</p>

<p>However, one advantage of the Pixel 9a is that it isn't a giant smartphone. The more compact form factor will be loved by fans of small phones, whereas the Phone 3a Pro is ideal for people who love big screens.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JTZD98S224YP44HxTa7SVB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-obsidian-in-hand" alt="The Obsidian Google Pixel 9a held in hand above a houseplant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JTZD98S224YP44HxTa7SVB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Google Tensor G4 chip</a> isn't as strong of a performer as the best options from Apple and Qualcomm, it's likely better than the midrange chip inside the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. Nothing's midranger is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a>, which is a recently refreshed processor optimized for AI. However, the Pixel 9a has the exact same Tensor G4 chip as the rest of the Google Pixel 9 series, which is a key advantage.</p><p>Additionally, our tests found that the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 in the Phone 3a Pro actually performed worse in gaming tasks than the MediaTek chip in the last-generation Phone 2a. As such, depending on your workflow, the Phone 3a Pro might not be as much of an upgrade as you may expect.</p>

<p>Battery life is a big perk of using the Pixel 9a, as it offers a 5,100mAh capacity. That's only 100mAh more than the Phone 3a Pro provides on paper, but real-world usage will be much different. With a smaller screen, the Pixel 9a's battery capacity will likely last longer than a similar-specced phone with a bigger screen. With that being said, the Phone 3a Pro's 3,000mAh capacity is no slouch.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro arguably wins the charging race with support for 50W wired charging, even if it doesn't support wireless. The Pixel 9a can only hit 23W wired charging and only supports Qi wireless instead of the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/does-the-google-pixel-9a-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2</a> spec.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="N4Abgy8YJhp4ScmyvkaoTB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-by-tree" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a sitting upright on a mossy surface leaning against a plant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N4Abgy8YJhp4ScmyvkaoTB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The difference-maker between these two phones may boil down to their camera systems, as the Pixel 9a has two rear cameras, whereas the Phone 3a Pro has three. Crucially, that third Phone 3a Pro sensor is a periscope telephoto lens, which makes lossless zoom shots possible. As someone who loves taking zoom shots at sporting events and concerts, the 3x optical zoom (6x with sensor crop) offered by the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is a key advantage.</p><p>Google's main sensors are known for producing quality shots with the help of great computational photography, and that might help the Pixel 9a. It uses a 48MP, f/1.7 main sensor with a 1/2-inch image sensor size. That's paired with a 13MP, f/2.2 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view. This year, the Pixel 9a supports advanced camera modes, like Astrophotography.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="W8458RA4JorsRzcEtggNTa" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Pro-1" alt="Photos of the Nothing Phone 3a series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W8458RA4JorsRzcEtggNTa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro's main camera is a 50MP, f/1.88 sensor from Samsung, and it features a 1/1.56-inch sensor size. It's joined by a 50MP, f/2.55 periscope telephoto lens from that can do up to 3x optical periscope zoom. Rounding out the rear camera system is an 8MP, f/2.2 ultrawide camera from Sony with a 120-degree field of view.</p><p>Putting it all together, the Phone 3a Pro has the telephoto advantage, while the Pixel 9a could win with its main and ultrawide lenses. Nothing also offers a 50MP front-facing camera, while Google gives the Pixel 9a a 13MP selfie camera.</p>

<p>Google's Pixel 9a has a clear edge in terms of software, with seven years of full OS upgrades and feature drops. Meanwhile, Nothing will only give the Phone 3a Pro three years of OS upgrades and six total years of security patches. Both phones feature plenty of AI, with Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and the Nothing-exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, the Google Pixel 9a is likely to be the more polished option at the sub-$500 price point. It has excellent Google software and plenty of AI features, plus a reliable camera system. More importantly, users in the U.S. will notice that the Pixel 9a has full carrier support, unlike the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. As such, the Pixel 9a is the easier phone to recommend than the Phone 3a Pro, even if the latter wins a few battles on the spec sheet.</p><p>Enthusiasts will be most likely to take a chance with the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. It has an interesting, transparent design with a Glyph Interface made up of three lighted strips. Plus, getting a periscope telephoto lens on a midrange phone is a nice perk. With that being said, weak cellular support in the U.S. and nonexistent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-verizon-phones">Verizon support</a> will be a dealbreaker for many.</p>

After all, Google now supports Pixel phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-many-software-updates-will-the-google-pixel-9a-get">for seven years</a>, meaning it makes a lot of sense to hold on to your existing Pixel even if it's a bit older.</p><p>But sometimes, hardware upgrades are hard to ignore. The Pixel A-series has seen some of the best upgrades in the Pixel line over the past three years, with massively improved display refresh rates, bigger batteries, IP water and dust resistance, and powerhouse cameras in addition to the same Tensor processor as the more expensive models.</p><p>So, how has the Google Pixel 8a held up over the last year, and is it worth upgrading to the Google Pixel 9a? Let's take a look.</p>

<p>It's hard to ignore the biggest difference between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a and Pixel 9a</a>: the design. In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a review</a>, I lauded the Pixel 8a for its rounded corners and matte finish on the back. "This is a phone that's built for human hands," I said, and I meant it. The Pixel 8a's curves and overall design are a masterwork in Pixel design, and none of the Pixel 9 series phones can match it.</p><p>That includes the incredibly bland and square Google Pixel 9a's design, which is now completely flat all around except for the rounded corners. It's a travesty, in my estimation, and I'm supremely disappointed in Google's decision to ruin what was so great about the Pixel 8a. If you love the design like I do, stick with the Pixel 8a.</p><p>The trademark <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">camera bar is also gone</a>, now replaced with a pill-shaped camera cutout. I still don't get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">why Google decided the camera bar had to go</a>, but it's another terrible decision that takes away from the joy of using a Pixel.</p><p>The camera bar was more than just a trademark symbol of the Pixel. It also gave the phone a slight lift when set on a table, making it easier to pick up. Now that the Pixel 9a is completely flat, not only is it harder to pick up from a table but it's less comfortable to hold because the edges are also flat. The slightly curved edges to the back of the Pixel 8a were so much better for ergonomics.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Google Pixel 8a's design was monumentally better, with more comfortable curves and a more distinct look.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The only real advantage you'll find with the Pixel 9a's design is that it's now IP68 water and dust-resistant, a slight bump up from the IP67 of the Pixel 8a. Realistically, this doesn't change much for most people. IP67 is more than enough even for taking your phone in the pool or washing it on occasion to keep it clean. IP68 is nice, for sure, but it's not worth upgrading for.</p><p>Google also upgraded the Actua display this year, increasing the brightness from 1400 nits on the Pixel 8a to 2,700 nits on the Pixel 9a. That sounds nice on paper, and it can be great when viewing the display outdoors and in sunlight, but Google continues to ignore those of us who are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a>. With a super slow 240Hz PWM rate and an extreme brightness of 2700 nits, this display will cause real pain for PWM-sensitive individuals.</p><p>The display supports 120Hz and is not LTPO, just as it wasn't on the Pixel 8a. The only real upgrade here is brightness, which may or may not make a difference for you. I never thought the Pixel 8a's display was difficult to see outside, and more brightness isn't necessarily a good thing for human eyes (although the opposite can be true, too).</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 8a's camera is already excellent. The Pixel 9a isn't really an upgrade here.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Google swapped out the 64MP main rear camera on the Pixel 8a with a 48MP camera on the Pixel 9a. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-more-megapixels-your-phone-camera-isnt-always-good-thing-sometimes-it">More megapixels aren't always better</a>, so while this sounds like a downgrade on paper, it likely means Google made the choice for a specific reason. We haven't put the Pixel 9a's camera through the review process yet, so I can't speak on specifics, but I doubt the change in sensor will be enough to upgrade.</p><p>The Pixel 9a still has a 13MP ultrawide camera on the back next to the main sensor, as well as a 13MP front-facing camera. In other words, there's no reason to change your Pixel 8a out for a 9a just for the camera.</p>

<p>It's been a long time since Pixels were known for cutting-edge performance, but the Pixel A-series typically packs a punch because of its price tag. For $100 more, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> will get you substantially better performance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-12r-256gb-unlocked-cool-blue/6570638.p?skuId=6570638">just $350</a> will upgrade you to a OnePlus 12R which also offers substantially better performance and faster charging than either of these phones.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the Pixel 9a is also kind of a weird upgrade over the Tensor G3 in the Pixel 8a. It's slower for a lot of tasks — particularly gaming — but sees a big boost in battery life and doesn't get hot the way the Tensor G3 did. If you ever had a problem with your Pixel 8a overheating, this might be reason enough to switch.</p><p>But if performance matters to you, sticking with the Pixel 8a might be the best bet. Tensor G4 achieves better battery life and cooler performance by throttling harder when the going gets tough. That means the phone will slow down more often to keep itself cool, but it's still faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a>, for instance.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 8a offers better performance but the Pixel 9a promises notably better battery life.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a's real advantage is the battery life. The Pixel 9a upgrades the battery to a 5,100mAh cell, up from 4,492mAh in the Pixel 8a. Since Tensor G4 is already a slightly more battery-efficient chip, this 13% increase in battery size equates to a few hours of additional usage over the Pixel 8a.</p><p>The Pixel 8a was the first Pixel A-series in recent years with decent battery life — the Pixel 6a and 7a were downright terrible in that regard — but the Pixel 9a is the first time that we should be able to call the battery life "good" since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-review">Pixel 5a</a>. Considering the Pixel 5a "only existed to prove Pixels can actually do battery right," according to our Pixel 5a reviewer, that's a compliment for this year's Pixel 9a.</p><p>No matter if you decide to upgrade to the Pixel 9a or stick with your Pixel 8a, charging speeds are still pretty slow. At 23W, this Pixel 9a barely charges any faster than the original Google Pixel that launched in 2016.</p>

<p>Upgrading from the Pixel 8a to the Pixel 9a doesn't make much sense unless you've had serious problems with battery life or the phone overheating. While the Pixel 9a offers some nice upgrades — a bigger battery, brighter display, slight ingress protection upgrade, and a cooler processor — it does so at the expense of several other things.</p><p>It loses the ergonomic design of the Pixel 8a and ditches the camera bar for a wholly generic "modern" design, as Google called it. Tensor G4 is slower than Tensor G3, meaning gamers won't be happy with the upgrade. It's also worth noting that any new software features that some with the Pixel 9a are already on the Pixel 8a thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March Pixel Feature Drop</a>.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is definitely a great buy for anyone coming from an older or slower phone, but for Pixel 8a owners, it just makes sense to hold on to your Pixel 8a until something truly better comes along.</p>

The budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-pad-9-review">Pad 9</a> delivered a massive 12.1-inch panel and standout battery life, and it was ideally suited for consuming content on the go. Honor followed it up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-pad-v9-review">Pad V9</a> last month, and it does a great job. <br><br>The brand is building on that momentum with the MagicPad 2. While you get a decent number of options these days if you want a good Android tablet, most products still come with an LCD panel. The MagicPad 2, meanwhile, has a 12.3-inch OLED panel, and that in itself is a huge differentiator. The switch to OLED means you get richer colors and excellent contrast levels, and the MagicPad 2 is an entertainment powerhouse. <br><br>There's terrific built-in sound, powerful hardware, and the tablet has excellent battery life. If you need a device to consume media on the go, the MagicPad 2 is easily the best mid-range tablet currently available.</p>

<p>Honor debuted the MagicPad 2 in July 2024, and the tablet is available in select global markets. It is sold in a single 12GB/256GB model in the U.K., and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/uk/tablets/honor-magicpad-2/buy/">retails for £399 ($518) on Honor's website</a> when you use the code <strong>APD2FE50</strong>. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HONOR-MagicPad2-12-3-inch-10050mAh-Battery/dp/B0DD45S8ZM">costs £499 ($628) on Amazon U.K.</a> as of writing. <br><br>If you're looking to pick up the tablet, I'd suggest doing so from Honor. The brand exclusively sells the white variant of the tablet on its site, and the best part is that it bundles the MagicPad 2 Smart Bluetooth Keyboard and Magic Pencil 3 with all orders, which is an additional savings of £160 ($200).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6mA3wYvAQHw2BrpMuchCqA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6mA3wYvAQHw2BrpMuchCqA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MagicPad 2 looks and feels like a high-end tablet, and the white color option that I'm using is fantastic. It doesn't have a glass back, with Honor instead going with a fiber material that brings down the weight. The white model has a distinct pattern that evokes memories of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-marble-odyssey-hands-on">OnePlus 11 Marble Odyssey</a>, and the satin texture is great to hold.</p>

<p>You'll notice a slight green tinge when viewing the back at an angle, and an advantage of not using a glass back is that it doesn't pick up any smudges. The mid-frame is made out of metal, and the tablet is relatively thin at just 5.8mm. Coming in at 555g, it's on the lighter side of the scale when you consider the size of the panel.</p>

<p>The rear camera island doesn't draw too much attention to itself, and it doesn't protrude from the chassis, so there isn't a wobble when using it on a table. The power button is located up top, and the volume buttons are on the right, and they're easy enough to access.</p>

<p>Honor did a good job minimizing the bezels, the camera is correctly positioned along the leading edge. If anything, the only point of contention with the MagicPad 2 is that it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor — you only get a PIN or passcode unlock and face unlock. I get that using an optical fingerprint sensor adds cost to the device, but Honor should have at least bundled a fingerprint module that's baked into the power button; not having it at all is a notable omission. <br><br>Other than that, there are no problems with the design of the MagicPad 2. It feels good to hold and use, and it's thin and light enough that you don't quite realize you're using an oversized tablet.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YDrefMWSEeBzXZDnpir3zA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YDrefMWSEeBzXZDnpir3zA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor outfitted the MagicPad 2 with the best panel in this category; the tablet has a 12.3-inch OLED screen with a resolution of 3000 x 1920 and 144Hz refresh, and it gets HDR10. It goes up to a maximum brightness of 1600 nits, and while that's when viewing HDR content, I didn't see any problems viewing the panel outdoors. It doesn't get quite as bright as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> — Honor doesn't use a tandem OLED — but it is still more than adequate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QU9CYf7fqqgyifwnyoPWzA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QU9CYf7fqqgyifwnyoPWzA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, the inclusion of the OLED panel gives the tablet a distinct edge over just about every other mid-range Android tablet. Colors are vibrant and contrast levels are excellent, and Honor continues to lead the industry when it comes to eye protection features. The tablet gets Defocus Eyecare tech — which is on the Magic V3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a> — alongside 4320Hz PWM dimming, and a blue light filter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mfkCzR5unTFZY5zgAPCbyA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mfkCzR5unTFZY5zgAPCbyA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Best of all, Honor's ebook mode is available on the tablet, and it makes the MagicPad 2 an absolute joy to use for reading books and long-form content. While I'd still choose an e-reader while traveling, the monochrome mode is significantly easier on the eyes when reading text, and I'm glad Honor retained it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o2SATJzHe7B9RLpQrp9MuA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o2SATJzHe7B9RLpQrp9MuA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the other end of the scale, HDR content looks fabulous on the tablet, with Netflix and YouTube taking advantage of the feature. The tablet has powerful built-in sound, and it's loud and detailed enough that you don't need to use a headset or earbuds while watching a TV show or movie. Gaming is similarly enjoyable, and I didn't have any issues even in demanding titles. <br><br>Overall, the massive OLED panel and the feature-set combine to make the tablet the best in its category, and if you need a device to consume multimedia on the go, this is the best option in the mid-range category.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magicpad-2-hardware-and-battery"><span>Honor MagicPad 2: Hardware and battery</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mXHXh7GojvXTR44iniR2wA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mXHXh7GojvXTR44iniR2wA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's not using the latest silicon, the MagicPad 2 is powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, and it does an admirable job in its own right. It handles demanding games well, and there are no problems with overheating or aggressive throttling. It comes in a solitary 12Gb/256GB configuration, and there's no way to get the 512GB model globally. <br><br>Regardless, the tablet doesn't have any shortcomings in this area, and it does a good job with routine tasks as well as intensive workloads. The tablet doesn't have cellular connectivity or NFC, but the Wi-Fi 6 modem maintains a strong signal, and I didn't see any problems with connectivity. There's Bluetooth 5.3 as well, and you get AptX HD and LDAC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J5pT8Co4YHvdyGfrBp4zuA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J5pT8Co4YHvdyGfrBp4zuA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's an 8MP camera up front, and while it isn't noteworthy, it does a decent enough job in video calls, and that's the most I used the module. The back of the tablet houses a 13MP camera, but even entry-level phones have much better cameras, and I wouldn't advice using the one at the back of the MagicPad 2. <br><br>The MagicPad 2 comes with a 10,500mAh battery, and it easily has over ten hours of screen time between charges. That is in line with other tablets of a similar size, and there are no issues in this area. Honor bundles a 66W charger in the box, and it takes the tablet just over 100 minutes to fully charge the battery.</p>

<p>Honor sells two accessories with the tablet: the MagicPad 2 Smart Bluetooth Keyboard, and Magic Pencil 3. The keyboard accessory does a good job safeguarding the tablet, and it positions the panel at a 60-degree angle, making it convenient to use. The keys don't have backlighting, but the key travel is astonishingly good, and I was able to get a decent amount of writing done on the keyboard.</p>

<p>I didn't see any issues with Bluetooth connectivity either, and it stayed paired to the tablet after setting it up. The Magic Pencil 3 is also decent, and it is good to take notes with. Handwriting recognition is decent, but it constantly corrected my name to Danish, and that just made me want to eat a pastry.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magicpad-2-software"><span>Honor MagicPad 2: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WgjPjnwTYPCVNaNotrKMuA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WgjPjnwTYPCVNaNotrKMuA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor debuted the tablet with MagicOS 8, but it picked up an update to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based MagicOS 9.0, bringing a cleaner UI and plenty of new features. Honor is positioning AI as a key point of differentiation, and that's evident when using the tablet; with utilities like Magic Portal, real-time translations, and a suite of image-editing tools, there's a lot to like in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J55AkqLPBaUoWs7NwAixuA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J55AkqLPBaUoWs7NwAixuA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor also did a good job rolling out multitasking features on the tablet, and the only quibble I have with the interface is the split notification shade. The Control Center sits to the right and houses all the toggles, and notifications get a dedicated pane. A unified solution would have been better, but it's clear that Honor wants to maintain consistency with its phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8okjZXezbXa25jwMbScZwA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8okjZXezbXa25jwMbScZwA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, there are no problems with the interface. The UI is fluid — thanks to the 144Hz refresh — and there's enough customizability available. The biggest issue with the tablet is that it will only get one software update and three years of security updates, and that just isn't enough in 2025. With the MagicPad 2 making the switch to MagicOS 9.0, it will not get any other platform updates, and Honor needs to change its policies.</p>

<p>I like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">OnePlus Pad 2</a> in this segment; it also has a sizable 12.1-inch panel, but it uses an IPS LCD instead of OLED. It has beefier hardware and better multitasking utilities, but the battery doesn't last quite as long. It is the closest alternative to the MagicPad 2, but I'd still suggest getting Honor's tablet as it has an OLED panel.</p>

<ul><li>You want long-term software updates</li><li>You need reliable biometrics to unlock the tablet</li></ul>
<p>Honor got the basics right with the MagicPad 2; it has a sleek design, standout battery life, and good internals. The biggest reason to pick up this tablet over its mid-range rivals is the OLED panel; the quality of the panel combined with 144Hz refresh makes the MagicPad 2 the ultimate choice for consuming multimedia at home or the go. This alone allows the tablet to distinguish itself from its rivals, and whether you're looking to stream TV shows, movies, play games, or read ebooks, the MagicPad 2 easily gets my recommendation. <br><br>The only point of contention with the tablet is that it won't pick up any platform updates; it made the switch to the Android 15-based MagicOS, and other than three years of security patches, it won't get any other updates. Honor claimed a win by promising seven years of software updates to the Magic 7 Pro — becoming the only Chinese brand to do so — but that doesn't extend to its other devices, and it's a shame that a tablet with as great a potential is being hobbled in this way. <br><br>Even then, there isn't another device that's as good as the MagicPad 2. So if you are looking to pick up a tablet mostly to watch TV shows and movies, it is the best choice in this category.</p>

<p>While the reason behind the delay is unspecified, it isn’t that alarming as it is just a matter of days — and it still makes the rollout of the One UI 7 within the same week.</p><p>Other than the devices mentioned above, older devices like the Galaxy S23 series, S24 FE, S23 FE, Galaxy Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5, and tablets like Galaxy Tab S10 and Tab S9 series will be receiving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based update in the following weeks after the April 7 and April 10 rollouts in the corresponding regions.</p><p>Yes, the One UI 7 rollout has been significantly delayed when compared to the previous iteration rollout. While many anticipated that it would be happening alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series launch back in January, it didn’t happen, and the Korean tech giant continued rolling out the One UI 7 beta updates for the Galaxy S24 models.</p>

<ul><li>Google is taking a cue from OpenAI and making Gemini available to access without an account.</li><li>You can now use Gemini on the web without signing into your Google account for added privacy.</li><li>Some Gemini features are limited or unavailable, like chat history and file uploads.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is making a slight tweak to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> that will make it more like OpenAI's ChatGPT — users can now access the Gemini web client without a Google account. While not every feature is available if you use Gemini without signing in, the new functionality makes it possible to get help from Google's chatbot without tying that data to you. The tweak is only available via the web client, not the mobile apps, and was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/18/gemini-no-sign-in/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>Now that Google has dropped the account requirement for Gemini, navigating to the Gemini web client will bring new users straight to the chat page instead of the sign-in page. Of course, if you are signed into a Google account in your browser already, the Gemini web client will attempt to automatically sign you in. As such, opening a private browsing window may be the easiest way to use Gemini independently from your Google account.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.43%;"><img id="q9NJvkxraFSUGKNUVZ6QjY" name="Gemini-Web-No-Account" alt="The Gemini web client being used without signing in." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9NJvkxraFSUGKNUVZ6QjY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3406" height="1854" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest limitation that comes with using Gemini without an account is being restricted to just the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. All the other models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (experimental), Gemini Deep Research, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-use-your-search-history-to-personalize-gemini-responses">Gemini Personalization (experimental)</a>, require you to sign in to access them. This isn't exactly surprising, since some of these models are locked behind Gemini Advanced and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>.</p><p>If you try to click one of the other models without signing in, you'll be shown the following message: "Sign in to explore the newest Gemini models." Other limitations include being unable to save and view your chat history, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-adds-document-upload-and-analysis-for-free-users">the lack of file upload support</a>.</p><p>For now, it appears the Gemini mobile app on iOS and Android still requires a Google account for chatbot access.</p>

<hr>
<p>Verizon announces a major update for its customers and a select group of smartphones today (Mar. 19).</p><p>The cellular service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-customers-satellite-texting-select-android-smartphones">announced</a> it is bringing satellite texting to any device via "select" Android phones in a press release. According to Verizon, its U.S.-based customers will be the first in the nation to receive such support. The company states users can "send text messages to any other customer device via satellite when outside the reach of terrestrial cellular networks."</p><p>There is some restriction here as Verizon states this satellite capability won't hit <em>every </em>Android phone. Users with a Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> or Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> phone can leverage its newly expanded satellite texting.</p><p>Verizon is starting to hammer away at these upgrades today (Mar. 19); however, it will likely take two weeks before it's completely stable and ready.</p><p>Verizon's EVP & president, Global Network and Technology, Joe Russo, said in a statement, "This expansion of satellite texting capabilities is a testament to our commitment to ensure customers stay connected wherever they are."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="v9y8kdjp3xdE2NNNtQMV9i" name="verizon-sign-storefront.jpg" alt="Verizon logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v9y8kdjp3xdE2NNNtQMV9i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Curiously, it's unclear whether or not this satellite texting capability includes the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Google Pixel 9a</a>. There is no information from Verizon nor Google on this matter. Android Central has reached out to Google about this matter and will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/pixel-9a-arrives-with-a-fresh-new-look">Pixel 9a launched today</a> (Mar. 19) with a fresh new look that forgoes that thick camera bump we've become accustomed to. The phone features a battery life of up to 30 hours and rapid charging support. For $499, the Pixel 9a contains Google's latest AI features like Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, and more.</p><p>In other news, Google mentioned briefly about the Pixel 9 series joining Verizon's satellite messaging services during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">its March feature drop</a>. It seems things are finally in a spot where both sides can move forward and begin bringing it to consumers. Additionally, Verizon highlights its work to expand and improve the usefulness of satellite communications — such as its usage for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-and-at-and-t-are-testing-satellite-based-video-calls-and-its-not-starlink">satellite-based video calls</a>.</p><p>In late February, Verizon joined AT&T in testing the first satellite-to-phone video calls using the BlueBird satellite from AST SpaceMobile. Verizon announced the test saw it placing its first-ever satellite call through this method. AST SpaceMobile said it was rolling out an on-demand direct-to-device service in the U.S. This is said to leverage Verizon and AT&T's 850MHz spectrum due to its close relation with smartphones.</p><p>There appears to be some optimism regarding satellite-based video calls; however, more testing is still required before civilians can partake.</p>

<ul><li>European Commission's preliminary findings show that Google fails to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) on two of its major products.</li><li>Google Search page and Google Play Store seem to be favoring the tech giant's products above all the other competitors in the market.</li><li>Google responds to this by stating that, the DMA "will hurt European businesses and consumers, hinder innovation, weaken security, and degrade product quality."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Earlier today (Mar. 19), the EU Commission published its preliminary findings stating that two of Google's most used products are in breach of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA).</p><p>The DMA is a legislation brought about by the European Union to regulate big tech companies to make sure they're playing fair and following practices that don't favor their products over other big players on the market— levelling the playing field for other tech companies.</p><p>This Act applies to large tech giants such as Alphabet(Google's parent company), Apple, and Microsoft among others. And Google has been dealing with the heat of the EU, since March 2024.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_811">report suggests </a>that Google Search, "self preferences" its products over others i.e., when a user searches for anything related to shopping, hotel booking, transport, or financial and sports results,<strong> </strong>the report claims that Google shows its products at the top of the results page, rather than similar services offered by third parties— making users gravitate to its websites more often. More specifically "Alphabet<strong> </strong>gives its services more prominent treatment compared to others," the report stated.</p>

<p>Secondly, the EU Commission states that Under the DMA, app developers that showcase and distribute their apps via the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play"> Google Play Store</a> should be allowed to steer customers to cheaper options other than the ones Google controls.</p><p>"Whilst Alphabet can receive a fee for facilitating the initial acquisition of a new customer by an app developer via Google Play, the fees charged by Alphabet go beyond what is justified."<strong> </strong></p><p>"Alphabet charges developers a high fee over an unduly long period of time for every purchase of digital goods and services," the report claimed.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5bGn34kesYNpYY8YDgL4E5" name="top-charts-play-store-s25-ultra" alt="Top Charts in the Play Store on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bGn34kesYNpYY8YDgL4E5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While this isn't the EU's final decision, these preliminary findings were enough to make Google look like they're in breach of the DMA. Responding to this report, Google stated in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/the-eus-competition-rules-are-hurting-consumers-and-businesses/">blog post</a> earlier today that, while the DMA aims at being fair to all players in the market, these rules are "having the opposite effect by hurting European businesses and consumers."</p><p>Furthermore, Google says that if the DMA is enacted, on Google Search, those rules will make it harder for people to find the exact business/website they're looking for— in turn impacting European businesses that rely on this traffic.</p><p>"Users are so frustrated that many are resorting to clunky workarounds to get to the companies and information that they want," Google added.</p><p>Let's not forget that Google did make some changes to Google Search to comply with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-may-become-less-useful-for-trip-planning-thanks-to-the-dma">DMA back in November 2024</a>, it tested removing advanced hotel-booking features entirely in Germany, Belgium, and Estonia for a limited time.</p><p>"Those changes, and many more that we have had to make in Europe, are already causing European businesses to lose up to 30% of traffic," the tech giant explained.</p><p>Speaking about the accusations on Google Play Store, the company says that the Commission's findings on Android and Play "create a false choice between openness and security. They risk exposing people in Europe to more malware and fraud." Since Google allows developers to distribute their apps freely onto the app store, this also creates an open playground for scammers to seep in, without any control from the company.</p><p>Now the only option that Google has is to create a more closed model, much like Apple where the company reviews all the apps that go through the store, without leaving it to the developers.</p><p>That said, since this isn't the final result of the investigation, the tech giant still has time to discuss with the EU Commission and look at options that will favor both parties.</p><p>"We will keep engaging with the Commission and comply with its rules. But today’s findings now increase the risk of an even worse experience for Europeans," Google added.</p>

<hr>
<p>Qualcomm's current generation of smartphone and tablet chips, including the Snapdragon 8 Elite has been incredibly successful. Using the company's own custom Oryon cores, phones with Snapdragon 8 Elite chips inside are significantly faster than their predecessors. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processors</a> are also quite expensive, and that's why a more affordable variant is on the horizon.</p><p>According to reputable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1902269621266255889" target="_blank">Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the affordable chipset — named Snapdragon 8s Elite — will start appearing in phones starting next month. Brar claims that there will be "plenty of phones sporting it" and that the initial wave of Snapdragon 8s Elite devices will "first launch in April."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Snapdragon 8s Elite is set to launch soon

Plenty of phones sporting it, first launch in April

What are your expectations with the new SoC?<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1902269621266255889">March 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This update from Brar contradicts a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1863520728752009380" target="_blank">previous claim</a> that said the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Elite would launch in March 2025. This leak, posted in December 2024, also claimed that the chip would be based on ARM, instead of the custom Oryon cores used in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite and Snapdragon X lineups. If this is the case, the Snapdragon 8s Elite chip could perform closer in line to older Snapdragon chips rather than the newer, Oryon-based SoCs.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/snapdragon-8s-elite-launch-soon-3536617/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, citing a January 2025 leak, notes that the Snapdragon 8s Elite could perform better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> and worse than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, with performance sitting somewhere in the middle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the breakdown of cores inside the Snapdragon 8s Elite processor, the January 2025 leak predicts that the chip will include eight total cores. Of those cores, there could be a big Cortex-X4 with a clock speed of 3.21GHz, paired with three performance Cortex-A720 cores clocked at 3.01GHz. The rest of the cores might be efficiency cores, including two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two more unnamed 2.02GHz cores.</p><p>Of course, this is all speculation until Qualcomm or its partner OEMs officially confirm the Snapdragon 8s Elite chipset and its specs.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has published a new support document to help its Pixel phone owners with an annoying, but easy-to-fix problem (hopefully).</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16048560#zippy=%2Cpixel-pro-xl%2Cpixel-pro%2Cpixel">recently updated</a> its certified screen protectors document with information on which are best for the Pixel 9 series. While many users search for the best ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">protect their devices</a> from <em>physical </em>harm, some items can hinder the performance of the display. Google says it's "Made for Google screen protectors are tested to ensure compatibility with Pixel phones."</p><p>Certain non-certified screen protectors can mess with the Fingerprint Unlock method, causing recurring failures.</p><p>Google says users looking to purchase a certified screen protector for its Pixel 9 series must ensure there are no air bubbles when applying. This may cause additional problems with the fingerprint sensor. Moreover, Google advises users to wait to setup Fingerprint Unlock until <em>after </em>the screen protector has been applied. In short, this is said to "help the sensor recognize you."</p><p>Below is a complete list of screen protector brands and product SKUs that are certified to work with the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<ul><li>BigBen: FGMGPIXEL9PORIG</li><li>BigBen: FGOGPIXEL9PORIG</li><li>BigBen: PEGLASSPIXEL9P</li><li>Case-Mate: CM053810</li><li>Cesium (Blu Element): 118-2737</li><li>Mous: TEM-A0825-CLRGLS-000-W1</li><li>OtterBox: 77-95656</li><li>Power Support: GPCK-22(SB-A080-GAGG/SMFG)</li><li>Spigen: AGL08445</li><li>Caseology: AGL08497</li><li>Zagg/Mophie: 200114439</li><li>Zagg/Mophie: 200314517</li><li>Zagg/Mophie: 200114443</li></ul>

<p>The Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro see the same supported/certified brands; however, the product SKUs differ. Consumers should look for Spigen (AGL08442), Caseology (AGL08496), and Zagg/Morphie (200114438, 200314516, and 200114442).</p><p>While these have been "tested" and "certified," Google says there's still a chance Fingerprint Unlock might have an off day. If issues persist even with one of these products, the company suggests you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/13537318#re-enroll_fingerprint">re-enroll</a> your fingerprint or switch over to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/14853136">Face Unlock</a>, instead.</p><p>If you're looking for something for your Pixel 9 Pro Fold, there's a compiled list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-screen-protectors">best screen protectors</a> — which might interest you.</p><p>Meanwhile, earlier this month, Google rolled out its huge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 feature drop</a> for Pixels. There was quite a bit available for phones, such as scam detection measures for the Messages and Phone app. Google also expanded its Satellite SOS feature to more places like Europe and Canada.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nearly a week after rolling out the platform-stable Android 16 Beta 3 update, Google is fixing a few issues with a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> Beta 3.1 patch. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1jeem4k/android_16_beta_31_now_available/" target="_blank">announced</a> on the Android Beta Program subreddit, this update is becoming available for enrolled devices now and carries a version number of <strong>BP22.250221.013</strong>. Android 16 Beta 3.1 does not include any new features, but rather includes four critical fixes, two of which that were reported by beta testers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/403303683" target="_blank">Google's Issue Tracker</a>.</p><p>Among the issues fixed, the biggest one might be a problem that caused the system Settings app to crash under specific circumstances. Reported under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/403303683" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Issue #403303683</u></a>, this problem caused repeated Settings crashes when a device's language was set to something other than English.</p><p>Another problem caused the screen brightness of devices running Android 16 Beta 3 to switch between app-specified brightness levels and system brightness levels. This bug was reported via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/392522561" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Issue #392522561</u></a>, and has been fixed in Android 16 Beta 3.1.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1jeem4k/android_16_beta_31_now_available">Android 16 Beta 3.1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Android 16 Beta 3.1 also includes fixes for two issues causing performance problems on devices enrolled in the Android beta. One problem resulted in excessive battery drain due to high CPU load, and another occasionally caused memory leaks in the system server, according to Google.</p><p>The update features all the changes and new capabilities introduced with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">the initial Android 16 Beta 3 release</a>, which marked the first time Android 16 reached platform stability. That includes Auracast support for wireless hearing aids and accessibility features for people with low vision.</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted rolling out its Wear OS 5.1 update for its LTE Pixel Watches.</li><li>The update is two weeks late for the LTE variants, but it brings a wealth of features like Loss of Pulse, Menstrual Cycle tracking, new media controls, and more.</li><li>Google's Wear OS 5.1 update seemingly marks a new era for the company and how it will update its the wearable software moving forward.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly rolling out its latest Wear OS update to its Pixel Watch series again, but this time it concerns a specific subset of consumers.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/18/pixel-watch-lte-wear-os-5-1-update/">9to5Google</a> post highlights the sudden appearance of the Wear OS 5.1 update rolling out for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, Pixel Watch 2, and the original Pixel Watch. The OTA (over-the-air) updates are reportedly coming online for owners of the LTE variants of these Pixel Watches since they were strangely left out of the Wear OS update earlier this month.</p><p>Google has posted the information regarding the update on its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota-watch">Full OTA Images</a>" page for the Pixel Watch series. According to the company, The LTE Pixel Watch 3 will see version BP1A.250305.019.W3 with the Wear OS 5.1 update. The LTE Pixel Watch 2 will see the same while the O.G. device will see version BP1A.250305.019.W2.</p><p>The OTA's availability seemingly surfaced late in the day yesterday (Mar. 18). Owners of an LTE Pixel Watch 3, 2, or 1 can begin checking for the Wear OS update today. However, it might not be widespread just yet, so continue to check as we wind down the week.</p>

<p>You may remember Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 feature drop</a> rolled out at the beginning of the month, and with came the Wear OS 5.1 update. The company dedicated a Pixel Watch-specific section that patch, with the headliner being the Loss of Pulse feature. Only for the Pixel Watch 3, Loss of Pulse will have your device automatically call emergency services if it does not detect your heartbeat and reach you for confirmation.</p><p>Of course, Google had to receive strong <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">approval from the FDA</a> for such a feature, which was delivered in February.</p><p>The other side of the Wear OS 5.1 update is Menstrual Cycle tracking on the Pixel Watch 3. Google states users can now log their periods, view cycle status, and see a "prediction" for the next one. Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/328790190/google-pixel-watch-update-march-2025?hl=en&sjid=395091567840875735-NA">patch notes</a> detail some other additions, such as an update to Pixel Watch media controls. It states the update makes it easier "to control audio content from the watch with control types based on content being played."</p><p>Counting steps has become a little more precise with this update alongside an expansion of automatic bedtime mode for the Pixel Watch 2.</p><p>However, with Wear OS 5.1 now out, we're starting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-1-kicks-off-new-update-strategy-for-pixel-watches">enter a new era of updates</a> from Google, which will be slower (quarterly), but more substantial.</p>

<p>Smartwatches have tracked sleep for years, but as we see more sleep coaching, energy scores, sleep apnea detection, and general AI analysis, it's fair to question how accurate a Pixel Watch's data is compared to, say, a polysomnogram or actigraphy watch.</p><p>So I sat down with Dr. Logan Schneider — an associate professor at Stanford University and Google's clinical lead for sleep health — and had a frank discussion about the usefulness, limits, and future of smartwatch sleep tracking.</p><p>Google frequently enlists practicing doctors to work with its engineers on health and wellness features. Earlier this month, I previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">interviewed Google's clinical lead of heart health</a>, Dr. Shreibati, about Loss of Pulse and how smartwatches will eventually deliver "personalized" diagnoses for heart conditions.</p><p>In this case, Dr. Schneider, who worked on projects like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sleep-profile-launch">animal-themed sleep profiles on Fitbits</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-new-sleep-features">Soli-powered sleep tracking on the Nest Hub</a>, had plenty of insights about how clinically useful these kinds of consumer-tech devices can be compared to medical-grade tech.</p>

<h2 id="the-science-behind-smartwatch-sleep-tracking-2">The science behind smartwatch sleep tracking</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vapE6ZGNhbBcAh2eGhWqm9" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-sleep-summary.jpeg" alt="Sleep score tile on the Google Pixel Watch 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vapE6ZGNhbBcAh2eGhWqm9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to studying sleep patterns on an individual or population level, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/polysomnography">polysomnograms</a> are "impractically expensive, time-consuming, and resource intensive," says Dr. Schneider.</p><p>A smartwatch is physically incapable of tracking brain waves (EEGs), eye movement, and some full-body motions that a clinical sleep study can detect. However, it does capture enough useful data to extrapolate the essentials without getting health insurance involved.</p><p>That's why Schneider saw the advent of smartwatches as an opportunity to "understand sleep in a novel way, looking at population health, looking at real world changes in sleep over time," and began reaching out to tech companies like Google. Smartwatches fill a niche that polysomnograms can't.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You can only get so good until you're literally starting to look at the brain waves.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I asked Dr. Schneider to give a clinical run-down of how sleep tracking works. He explained how your "body's physiology and its state of motion versus immobility recapitulates what's going on in the brain" and how they can determine your "rest and digest" or "fight or flight" states as a reflection of your brain states.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VGDMFhFWcEZEZXhY2oWAYU" name="google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-sleep-sensing-16x9-1.jpg" alt="Nest Hub (2nd Gen)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VGDMFhFWcEZEZXhY2oWAYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Dr. Schneider helped convert this smart display into a sleep tracker </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Heart rate is an obvious tool for sleep stage approximation, but he put even more emphasis on movement tracking as a vital tool. The inactivity of deep sleep, twitchy paralysis of REM, and more frequent movement in light sleep can all be estimated by your watch's accelerometer.</p><p>False-positive movements — like when your partner shifts the bed while you're in deep sleep — can be one of the big factors when your watch gets sleep estimates wrong. That's why Schneider remains proud of their work taking the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Nest Hub</a>'s Soli radar and turning it  into a "full body actigraph and cardiopulmonary physiology sensor that could stage sleep quite accurately" because it gets a wider view of your body.</p><p>Ultimately, Schneider believes, smartwatches "can only get so good until you're literally starting to look at the brain waves."</p>

<p>I asked Dr. Schneider what, if anything, could make smartwatch sleep data better <em>without</em> EEG tech. He argued there probably isn't some "gold signal" that makes things perfect, but that isn't strictly necessary.</p><p>The main key for accuracy, he explained, is having "redundant signals." Neurologists looking for a brain issue don't go straight for the MRI or scalpel; they might test your muscular reflexes to catch a "dysfunction" first. Since there are "several different types of redundant signals of the autonomic nervous system," smartwatch brands can look at those secondary sources and get more reliable results.</p><p>We already see that with factors like heart rate variability (HRV), breathing rate, and skin temperature, as secondary information for whether your body is "normal" or if something is trending wrong.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There's some general event horizon where you're never going to get on the wrist a measure of what's going on in the brain.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One potentially new smartwatch metric Schneider brought up was "galvanic skin response." Essentially, if you look at your skin's sweat creation and salt content, you can determine your body's sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response and see, for instance, when your sleep state is unstable.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a> have a cEDA sensor that looks at sweat levels on your skin, primarily for stress detection. That seems like a perfect fit for using sweat levels to improve sleep accuracy, but I didn't think to ask about this during the interview. Maybe we'll see this in the future!</p><p>But ultimately, it comes back to Google's PPG. He credited Google's engineers for "optimizing the signal acquisition and quality," as well as the multi-path optical sensor that ensures reliable, continuous data that approaches what you'd get from a "gold standard polysomnogram."</p><p>For what it's worth, testers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/Jr4p66vSmLY">Qualified Scientist</a> say the Pixel Watch 3 is highly reliable for sleep accuracy. But Dr. Schneider still says that "there's some general event horizon where you're never going to get on the wrist a measure of what's going on in the brain."</p>

<p>I asked Dr. Schneider about the recent trend of smartwatches and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> starting to detect sleep apnea and if there are other potential sleep conditions (aka <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/parasomnias">parasomnias</a>) that he believes smartwatches could detect.</p><p>He very enthusiastically responded that "it could be a great opportunity for tech like this to actually pick up on" conditions like Restless Leg Syndrome and sleepwalking that can be difficult to catch in limited clinical contexts but that a smartwatch <em>will</em> detect with enough patience.</p><p>Smartwatches will need to be able to differentiate between REM behavior disorders (e.g., sleep paralysis), non-REM parasomnias ranging from sleepwalking to sleep talking and even sleep eating disorders, and seizure disorders.</p><p>Dr. Schneider seems very optimistic that watches could "pick up on interesting signals" in the future, "depending upon what set of sensors you have."</p><p>This would have a direct clinical application, too. After someone is treated for a sleep disorder, it's hard to determine if you're "truly" cured or just have "fewer episodes that you're <em>aware</em> of." A smartwatch could passively solve that mystery and give patients (and doctors) peace of mind.</p>

<p>I have a complicated relationship with sleep tracking. I wrote last year about how I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hated wearing a smartwatch to bed</a>, and I've found that seeing bad sleep data can often compound my stress. So I asked Dr. Schneider why people can't trust their own bodies to feel how tired they are.</p><p>He responded with an anecdote about a man who said he was sleeping great while not believing his wife, who said he was "dying" at night and falling asleep at the wheel.</p><p>"People are terrible estimators. And why is that? Our brain habituates to our current state of being," he explained. You can function with a "severe amount of sleep impairment that you're not even fully cognizant of," and sometimes you need help recognizing that.</p><p>He believes it's worth the discomfort of a smartwatch to have this self-knowledge. And since he has to "convince people to wear a Darth Vader mask every single night" for sleep apnea, he thinks it's worth getting accustomed to <em>some</em> form factor of wearable tech to help you "figure out how you're feeling."</p><p>But if, like me, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> isn't the right fit for you, then Dr. Schneider thinks you really should consider that Nest Hub radar. To which I'd say, if Google hurries up and makes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-should-build-new-nest-hub-with-gemini">3rd-gen Nest Hub with Gemini</a>, I'll consider it!</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-87">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The fifth One UI 7 beta just landed in the U.S., pushing the Galaxy S24 Ultra one step closer to its stable Android 15 release in April.</li><li>This update smooths out issues like glitchy lock screen notifications, a wonky Nowbar controller, and those tiny, hard-to-see widget icons.</li><li>Samsung patched up the Gallery edit button for better reliability and made media playback notifications display in real time.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in the U.S. just received its fifth One UI 7 beta update, rolling out a few days after Samsung made it official. This update brings the phone one step closer to the stable Android 15 release, which is set to drop in April.</p><p>This update brings a fresh camera feature to the table while squashing a bunch of bugs.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-and-ui-tweaks-2">Bug fixes and UI tweaks</h2>
<p>Highlights include fixing a glitch with lock screen notifications, smoothing out display hiccups with the Nowbar controller, and tackling those annoyingly tiny icons in the widget settings.</p><p>On top of that, it cleans up blurry transparency effects, sorts out wonky font and image overlaps, and tightens up the spacing in the quick action menu.</p><p>Furthermore, the Gallery’s edit button should now work more consistently, and notification history errors have been patched up.</p><p>Samsung has also tweaked media playback notifications, making them show up in real time.</p>

<p>The latest beta isn’t leaving the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus out of the fun—it’s bringing Log video support to these models too. That’s a feature that was exclusive to the S24 Ultra in Beta 4, so now more users can get in on the action.</p><p>Log Video, which first debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series, lets you shoot videos with a wider dynamic range. This means you’ve got more flexibility to tweak colors and fine-tune your footage during editing.</p><p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-be-releasing-one-ui-7-on-april-7">locked in April 7 for the stable One UI 7 rollout</a>. However, U.S. users will have to wait a bit longer because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> will start hitting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy devices</a> in the country on April 10, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-one-ui-7-announces-official-rollout-starting-from-april-7-2025/" target="_blank">Samsung US</a>.</p>

Just like the A-series phones that came before it, the Google Pixel 9a is available in four shades.</p><p>As is typical of the affordable Pixel lineup, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> comes in two basic colorways and two more colorful ones. Google never skips black and some sort of white or beige, so it's usually the other two shades that leave room for excitement.

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-sets-trend-for-pink-phones">Pink is a hot trend</a> in the smartphone market right now, so the blushing Google Pixel 9a in Peony is a good choice if you care about being fashionable. It's a really fun color with matching accessories in the Google ecosystem, such as the Rose Quartz Active Band for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> in Peony.</p><p>If you're not a fan of pink, Iris is a fabulous choice, too. This powdery blue-ish hue has hints of purple in there. It's a pleasing shade, for sure. I wish it was more lavender than periwinkle, but I still adore this Pixel 9a-exclusive colorway. Based on past trends, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> series and one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> bands will probably have the same color as well.</p><p>Don't sweat too much over the selection process. Buying the right color Google Pixel 9a is important, but you can always change the look of your device with a nice phone case. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">Cheap Android phones</a> like these have affordably priced covers, so it's not a big deal if you change your mind later or get tired of the hue.</p>

It gets the Tensor G4 — same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> — alongside a new 48MP camera and 13MP wide-angle lens, and a huge 5100mAh battery.</p><p>Google usually makes its devices available for pre-order on launch day, but that isn't the case with the Pixel 9a; instead, the device will be going on sale sometime in April. In a statement to Android Central, Google noted a "component quality issue" affecting initial Pixel 9a units as the reason: "We're checking on a component quality issue that's affecting a small number of Pixel 9a devices."<br><br>This is absolutely the right move; Google's devices have been disproportionately affected by issues in the past, so it makes sense that the brand is being cautious this time. Google didn't go into any detail as to what component is at fault, only stating that the device will be available from next month.</p>

<p>Google is clearly being ambitious with the Pixel 9a. While its predecessors retained the same design as their siblings, the Pixel 9a switches up the styling, and the flatter look along with a new camera island that sits flush with the body differentiates it considerably from the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro. <br><br>Just like the regular Pixels, AI is a key area of focus with the Pixel 9a, with Google bringing most of its on-device features to the mid-range device. There's a new thermal solution that should make it a better gaming phone — overheating was a big problem on last year's Pixel 8a. Google is also guaranteeing seven years of Android OS and security updates, which means the 9a will get more software updates than any other phone in this segment. <br><br>Debuting at $499, the Pixel 9a has the potential to be a terrific mid-ranger, and while I don't like waiting, it's better to do so in this instance — it ensures we get a device that doesn't have hardware issues out of the box. It's a refreshing change of pace from Google, and I'm doubly excited to see what the Pixel 9a has to offer.</p>

<ul><li>The “Untrusted device” error early this month primarily affected older Chromecast and Chromecast Audio users and caused a significant inconvenience.</li><li>Google now has provided specific firmware versions (1.56.467165 for 2nd gen Chromecast and 1.56.467166 for Chromecast Audio) and instructions for users to update their devices.</li><li>For users who’d factory reset their devices, the search giant advises updating the Google Home app and setting up the affected devices again to resolve the issue.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Early this month, several older Chromecast owners reported issues with their devices as they were seeing “Untrusted device” errors. The issue was particularly faced by 2nd-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio users. While the search giant has already addressed the issue, it is now finally rolling out a fix.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Google Nest Team, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Streaming/Regarding-an-issue-with-Chromecast-2nd-gen-and-Chromecast-Audio/td-p/686992">corresponding support page</a>, apologized for the inconvenience and disruption caused and further notes that they are “committed to ensuring all users are back up and running as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>For users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-chromecast-second-gen-users-face-untrusted-device-error">who’ve faced the issue</a> and their devices still don't function as intended, the Google Nest team advises them to check the firmware version of the device — firmware version <strong>1.56.467165</strong> for 2nd gen Chromecast and firmware version <strong>1.56.467166</strong> for the Chromecast Audio — and follow with an accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/7124014?hl=en#zippy=%2Ccheck-the-firmware-version-of-your-streaming-device">instruction page</a>.</p><p>Further, if their device doesn’t match the corresponding firmware version, users need to reboot their devices and start the update process, which seemingly should make the broken devices function normally.</p>

<p>When Google addressed the issue last week, it recommended users not factory reset their Chromecast devices. However, for those who have already done that, here's what you need to do.</p><p>Users are asked to update their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> app to the latest version (3.30.1.6 for Android and 3.30.106 for iOS) and set up the 2nd gen Chromecast and Chromecast Audio devices again. The said app update roll out appears to have begun already, and users might be seeing the version in a couple of days.</p><p>We recommend users stay updated with the latest firmware and app versions to ensure they have a flawless streaming experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has finally announced the budget phone to its Pixel 9 series— <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a arrives</a> with all the latest AI tools you'd need to get through your day-to-day activities. Google seems to have dropped us a Pixel-sized surprise right before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O 2025</a> and we aren't complaining. However, there are some significant changes that the device came with this year so let's get into it.</p><p>Right off the bat, you see the Pixel 9a sports an all-new look, ditching its usual "Pixel-like" appearance, for a sleek, flat, rear panel that houses the camera array within the phone. While the big pill-shaped camera bump seems to be all but gone, the phone has the same rounded aluminum side rails as its predecessors.</p><p>For its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch  pOLED screen but is 35% brighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a </a>at 2700 nits — and a 120 Hz adaptive refresh rate, that brings smoother navigation within the device. Google says the Pixel 9a, much like the 8a has an <em>Actua</em> display, meaning Google worked hard to ensure proper color accuracy, but that also means it uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. The screen gets its protection from Gorilla Glass 3, Full 24-bit depth just like its previous model.</p>

<p>Getting to what lies at the heart of this budget model is Google's Tensor G4 (4nm) chipset much like this year's flagship models, that is said to power Gemini Nano and all the other AI features like<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8"><em> Best Take</em></a><em>,</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9"><em> Add Me</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8"><em>Magic Editor</em></a><em> and more.</em></p><p>Talking about power, the Pixel 9a arrives with a massive 5,100mAh, which is larger than the standard Pixel 9 model(4700mAh), giving it a boost in battery life. Google claims that the device will have over 30 hours of battery life with just one charge and can run for up to 100 hours on Extreme battery saver mode.</p><p>With the massive battery also comes faster charging speeds since you wouldn't want to wait around for your phone to charge. The Pixel 9a trumps its predecessor with a 23W wired charging speed and supports 7.5W<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-google-pixel-9-support-qi2-wireless-charging"> Qi-certified wireless </a>chargers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-in-hand" alt="A close up of the Peony Google Pixel 9a held in hand in front of a houseplant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Getting to the phone's camera system is now embedded into the back panel of the device, unlike any other Pixel phone to date. The device comes with a smaller 48MP primary lens, sticks to the 13MP ultra-wide lens from the Pixel 8a, and a 13MP selfie camera. All three lenses can capture 4K video, with 60fps for the rear cameras and 30fps for selfies.</p><p>Protecting all of these features is the IP68 dust and water resistance meaning the device can withstand submersion in water beyond 1 meter for more than 30 minutes, like most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best-selling Android phones</a> on the market. It is important to note that this resistance can wear over time, based on usage and other factors.</p>

<p>Lastly, coming to the software that powers it all. The phone is said to come with the latest Android 15 out-of-the-box. This will also help power all of Gemini's latest features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and Pixel-specific features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pixel-call-assist"><em>Call Assist</em></a><em>, Hold For Me, Direct My Call,</em> and more. That said, the budget Pixel 9a is on par with the rest of the Pixel 9 series, getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">seven years of OS updates </a>up until Android 22 along with security updates through to 2032. The device comes with enhanced security features like<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-second-pixel-feature-drop-brings-car-crash-detection-motion-sense-improvements-and-more"> Car Crash Detection</a> and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-security-reinforcements-global-rollout"> theft protection</a> as well.</p><p>The Pixel 9a series starts at the same price point, $499, and comes in four colorways.  Adding to the existing Obsidian and Porceline are two fun colorways— Peony and Iris. The device comes with two storage options like its predecessor:  128GB and 256GB storage along with 8GB of RAM. While we are yet to get the exact date for presales and in-store sales, you can be the first to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_9a?utm_source=keyword&utm_medium=google_oo&utm_campaign=GS108173&pli=1&hl=en-GB">get notified</a> when the phone does drop. Google says the Pixel 9a will be available for purchase as early as April.</p>

What made Google choose this new water-drop camera cutout, and is it the new normal for Pixels? Google gave us several justifications for the change and a hint of what to expect from the Pixel 10.</p><p>As our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a hands-on</a> shows, this new budget phone has ditched the camera bar and rounded edges for a flatter, machine-cut look. The dual rear cameras jut out from the plastic matte back in a teardrop shape inspired by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> display aesthetic instead of resting inside an aluminum bar.</p><p>When asked during our Google Pixel 9a briefing whether Google made this decision out of logistics or aesthetics, Pixel product manager Soniya Jobanputra answered, "We did not start with the presumption that it had to be flat."</p><p>Instead, the Pixel team's priority was to "eliminate battery anxiety" and "improve our thermal solution." And while they didn't say it outright, their secondary concerns seemed to be keeping the Pixel 9a skinny <em>and</em> more distinct from the mainline <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.</p>

<p>One of the biggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a-to-9a upgrades</a> is a battery capacity boost from 4,492 mAh to 5,100 mAh, larger even than the 6.8-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>'s capacity. This helps it hit a "30+ hour battery life."</p><p>Asked about this battery life boost, product manager Shenaz Zach Mistry explained that "this user segment has also been very sensitive to the battery life," suggesting that budget Pixel buyers prioritized longer battery life over other factors.</p><p>"We had grown the battery, we had grown the vapor chamber to improve the thermals," Jobanputra said, and on top of that, "we were looking at a new camera module that had better capabilities" than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> camera.</p><p>Despite that, Google managed to keep the Pixel 9a and 8a at the same thickness (8.9mm). To do that, they had to look at solutions like shrinking the camera sensor and switching to a pOLED display that was "a lot thinner" than what they typically use in "this tier of product."</p>

<p>"The confluence of all that got us pretty darn close," said Jobanputra. "And so our mechanical team did a little bit of magic, working directly with our industrial design team to pull off this just absolutely fabulous looking new design with that flat back."</p><p>No one said it flat out, but after adding the thicker battery, the Pixel 9a engineers must have thought that the typical camera bar, rounded back, and OLED would've made the Pixel 9a too thick and ugly. So, rather than abandon the battery upgrade to make the 9a more distinct and exciting, they pivoted and treated a new, flat design as a positive challenge.</p><p>Jobanputra says it was a "culmination of a bunch of different factors" that got the Pixel 9a "within shooting distance" of a flat design. "And then once we were close, we were like, 'Let's do it. Let's make this happen. Let's give it its own personality, yet still be part of that Pixel family.'"</p>

Whether they're real or not, it's all but guaranteed that Google seemingly has no intention of ditching its signature camera bar on <em>all</em> future Pixels, just the Pixel A-series, removing the overlap between it and the flagships.</p><p>The point of this "new flat design profile" was "setting [the Pixel 9a] apart from our other Pixel 9 phones," Jobanputra said while still "remaining true to the iconic Pixel look."</p><p>Making the Pixel 9a more distinct and turning the camera bar into a perk for mainline phone buyers is a solid branding decision if nothing else. Pixel fans will either adjust to the new look or upsell themselves to the Pixel 10 for the familiarity.</p><p>That said, I'm genuinely curious if the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel foldable</a> will adopt this new camera look simply to make it easier to fold into your pocket.</p>

<p>Judging the Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 8a is about more than the specs. Yes, Google significantly upgraded the display, main camera, and battery life. You must also weigh its drastic no-camera-bar redesign and whether the Pixel 9a is too similar to the 8a in other ways. If you bought the Pixel 8a to save money, is it too soon to drop another $500 on the 9a?</p><p>We loved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, and while our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a hands-on</a> only scratches the surface, we know what AI and camera features it'll have (or won't have) from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, as well as a general sense of what kind of performance boost to expect from the Tensor G4 over the G3.</p><p>Let's dive into the Google Pixel 9a vs. 8a differences and similarities to help you decide whether it's time for an upgrade or if you should hold out for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> or 10a.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="cEQmVWxQzVzvRRiGuWPDaA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-camera-bar" alt="Close-up of the Peony Google Pixel 9a, focused on the camera cutout and LED." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEQmVWxQzVzvRRiGuWPDaA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest Pixel 9a change stems from Google's decision to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">remove the camera bar</a> and give the newer model a flat back and "streamlined camera design." Google said that it was "inspired by water droplets" when making the new camera cutout, similar to what you see on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, while the Pixel 8a has a more traditional Pixel look.</p><p>Both phones have the same official 8.9mm thickness, but the 8a has slightly softer edges — though you still feel the line between the aluminum sides and matte polycarbonate back. With the Pixel 9a, you get the harder, machine-cut edges that you typically see on iPhones or recent Galaxy phones, but the composite matte back is essentially unchanged. You need a mainline Pixel for a proper glass back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="aDMpcsg7XvS68icXuKTNGB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-vs-8a-side-view-2" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a (left) and Bay Google Pixel 8a (right) aside one another on a white table, the angle showing their relative difference in thickness." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aDMpcsg7XvS68icXuKTNGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, if you're using a phone case, the type of grip won't really matter. Generally speaking, the Pixel 9a is only 0.6mm wider than the 8a and weighs a few grams <em>less</em>, probably because of the lack of an aluminum camera bar.</p><p>Both phones come in Obsidian (black) and Porcelain (near-white). The Pixel 8a came in a subtle Bay blue and vibrant Aloe green; the Pixel 9a, similarly, has a quieter Iris purple shade and a much more vivid Peony red-pink.</p><p>Like last year, the Pixel 9a has 100% plastic-free packaging and 100%-recycled aluminum. It uses 81% recycled plastic in the back cover, slightly more than the Pixel 8a (76%), but the 8a had slightly more "recycled materials based on product weight" (24% vs. 23%) because of its camera bar.</p>

<p>While the Pixel 8a had a respectable IP67 dust and water resistance rating, the Pixel 9a hits the IP68 standard common on most flagships. That means the Pixel 8a does fine for "temporary immersion" in shallow water for about 30 minutes, while the Pixel 9a might last longer at slightly greater depths — Google doesn't specify except to say that the 9a isn't "water or dustproof."</p><p>Google didn't upgrade the display protection rating: either phone gives you Gorilla Glass 3, well below the protective rating of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro'</a>s Victus 2. You may want to buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>.</p><p>You also won't notice any changes in terms of the optical fingerprint sensor, power button, and volume rocker, USB-C 3.2 port, stereo speakers, or dual mics.</p>

<p>One of the biggest Pixel 9a vs. 8a changes is the larger, brighter display. Fans of smaller phones may not like that the 9a jumps from a 6.1- to 6.3-inch display, while others will appreciate the extra space for apps and games.</p><p>The Pixel 9a uses a pOLED in place of the 8a's traditional OLED, swapping a glass substrate for a thinner plastic material, which helps the 9a stay the same thickness despite its larger battery. Otherwise, the 9a and 8a have the same 120Hz refresh rate — though no Pro-level LTPO tech — and 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, half as good as the mainline Pixel 9 and 9 Pro.</p><p>The Pixel 8a display is slightly more pixel-dense, but not significantly so (430 vs. 422 PPI). More importantly, the Pixel 9a has an extra 400 nits of brightness in HDR mode and 700 nits in peak brightness mode, giving you better indoor and outdoor visibility.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="2f7mpfHXguDNwaFGso2TNB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-side-view" alt="A parallel photo of the Peony Google Pixel 9a, showcasing its thick, machine-cut design, the camera cutout, and the Google logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2f7mpfHXguDNwaFGso2TNB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3918" height="2205" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a has the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip found in last year's Pixel 9 series, one generation past the Pixel 8a's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a>. Both phones have the same RAM and storage options, so any performance improvement will come down to the chipset.</p><p>Both Tensor chips are Samsung-made on a 4nm node. The newer Tensor jumps from an Arm Cortex-X3 (2.9GHz) to a Cortex-X4 (3.1GHz) prime core. The other cores are also one generation newer with slightly higher clock speeds: 2.6 vs. 2.37GHz for performance and 1.92 vs. 1.70GHz for efficiency cores. However, the G3 actually has one more performance core, so that might narrow the gap a bit. Our Pixel 9a review should give us more concrete information on benchmarks.</p><p>In terms of the GPU, both phones should have the same Arm Mali-G715 with six cores, except that the 9a GPU should be clocked slightly higher (940MHz vs. 890MHz). That said, we found that the Pixel 9 series tended to throttle performance while gaming to prevent overheating, so the lower-RAM Pixel 9a may have the same tendency. In other words, we wouldn't expect any significant gaming gains this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DFvmyLe3r3brPBjM84KHjh" name="google-pixel-8a-lockscreen-customized.jpg" alt="A customized Google Pixel 8a lock screen with a large, cartoony clock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFvmyLe3r3brPBjM84KHjh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest performance change is in battery life. We've yet to test this for ourselves, but Google says the Pixel 9a will last an extra six hours (30 vs. 24) per charge or 28 hours (100 vs. 72) in Extreme Battery Saver mode. This is largely thanks to the extra 608mAh of battery capacity or a 13.5% increase over the Pixel 8a battery.</p><p>You may also see a slight boost in charging speed: Google says the Pixel 9a supports up to 23W wired charging, beating the 18W max on the Pixel 8a. It's still a bit short of the 27W charging on the pricier Pixel 9 phones, but slow charging was one of our main 8a complaints, so every little bit helps.</p><p>Wireless charging remains at the same 7.5W speed as last year, with no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 support</a> just yet and well short of the Pixel 9 (15W) or Pixel 9 Pro XL (23W) when using the Pixel Stand.</p><p>As for other hardware concerns, the Pixel 9a remains at Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, with no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> like the Pixel 9 or Ultra Wideband like the 9 Pro. But the 9a does add dual-band GNSS for the first time, which will help pinpoint your Google Maps location or track workouts more easily in places with signal blockage, like tall buildings.</p>

<p>Google didn't change the ultrawide or selfie cameras between the Pixel 8a and 9a, so the main difference is with the main camera and the new AI-backed post-processing tools.</p><p>You may assume the Pixel 8a's 64MP sensor is better than the Pixel 9a's 48MP sensor at first glance, but the latter has a larger aperture for better light, a slightly wider FoV, and a Dual Pixel system with improved autofocus for action shots. The 9a's camera specs seem identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>'s main sensor, although Google says they're "slightly different," without specifying how.</p><p>On the other hand, the Pixel 8a has a larger image sensor (1/1.73" vs. 1/2"), which typically results in better light capture as well. The 9a prioritized a thinner design, so that may play into the quality of the photos. We'll have a more definitive answer after we can test the 9a for ourselves.</p><p>Otherwise, the newer Tensor G4 chip unlocks a few useful camera tricks that the Pixel 8a lacks. Google says the Pixel 9a is the first A-series phone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, and it also supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> for group photos.</p><p>The Pixel 8a already has a long list of AI-backed tools — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, Real Tone, Frequent Faces, and so on — and it matches the Pixel 9a with its 8X Super Zoom. Neither lets you access Pro camera controls like manual shutter speed, either.</p>

<p>The Pixel 8a was the first A-series phone to offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-many-updates-will-the-pixel-8a-receive">seven years of software updates</a>. So, while it's impressive that the $500 Pixel 9a will get seven OS updates and seven years of monthly Pixel Drops, the Pixel 8a did it first.</p><p>The Pixel 9a will launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and both phones are expected to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> at the same time this summer. Aside from those few Pixel 9 series exclusives like Add Me and Macro Focus, the 9a and 8a will have the same software until 2032.</p><p>Unlike the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9a won't come with a free year of Gemini Advanced. But you'll still get the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> features that you're used to on the 8a or other Pixels. You might see a <em>very</em> slight boost in AI performance thanks to Tensor G4, but nothing significant.</p><p>In other words, upgrading to the Pixel 9a from the 8a won't feel especially different from a software perspective.

<p>There's no doubt that the Pixel 9a is a superior phone to the 8a in both distinct and subtle ways. But anyone who buys the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phone</a> of 2024 (the Pixel 8a) might not want to spend another $500 so soon unless you're particularly impressed with one of the Pixel 9a preorder deals with a trade-in.</p><p>The switch to Tensor G4 is a nice perk, but unless you're especially excited by astrophotography or macro focus, the Pixel 8a's Tensor G3 is quite similar. The same goes for the display: it's larger and brighter, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-7a">8a-to-7a boost</a> was more significant.</p><p>Truly, the one change that has us most excited is the extra six hours of battery life or an extra day in low-power mode; if you're an active user and the 8a tends to die on you before the end of the day, the Pixel 9a should solve that problem.</p><p>If you don't own either phone, we'd recommend choosing the Pixel 9a over the 8a, even if the latter is on sale. But if you already own the Pixel 8a, it's more of a toss-up if you should upgrade.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I had an idea of what to expect going into my Google Pixel 9a hands-on in Mountain View, but its new "personality" still took me by surprise in person. It's the first hard-edged, no-camera-bar Pixel I've ever seen, with the 2019 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-review">Pixel 4</a> as the closest Google-made lookalike I could find. And it takes some getting used to.</p><p>We've seen more and more Android phones take the flat-edged, machine-cut route in recent years, from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>. The Pixel 9a sharing that style is no surprise, but it comes in tandem with a flattened camera sensor that makes the whole package look very minimalist.</p><p>Google explained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">why it cut the camera bar</a> during its pre-brief: it prioritized adding a larger battery, which meant finding ways to thin down the design to keep it from becoming too bulky. And the designers wanted to "give it its own personality" yet still have it "be part of that Pixel family."</p><p>As someone whose first Google phone was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> and who currently uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, I have no small amount of nostalgia for the camera bar as it's evolved from a massive rectangle to a bold oval cutout. Despite Google's reasonable justification, seeing the camera equivalent of the Pixel Watch's droplet display smooshed into the Pixel 9a's top-left corner was an adjustment!</p><p>Since Google has asked us to hold off on any 9a software coverage or testing until next week, I can only focus on surface-level impressions and officially shared specs for this Pixel 9a hands-on. But there's already plenty of information for us to chew on, particularly how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 9a was upgraded over the Pixel 8a</a>.</p>

<p>I obviously couldn't test battery life in a short demo, but the new 5,100mAh battery and larger vapor chamber make themselves known across the entire Pixel 9a design. You could argue it's the signature upgrade!</p><p>Google managed to keep the 9a at the same 8.9mm thickness as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, but only through plenty of "optimization." Google said they had to "shrink" the camera module down to a thin sliver and use a skinnier pOLED display — the same type you see on most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-display-lock-screen" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in the photographer's hand.

<p>Despite all that effort, the Pixel 9a is about 0.5-1mm thicker than most of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a>. Why? Because these phones typically have much larger displays and dimensions, so they have more space to spread out their 5,000mAh batteries.</p><p>That said, it's <em>very</em> rare to see a battery this large paired with a display this petite. Weigh its 5,100mAh capacity against the 3,500mAh iPhone 16, 4,000mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, 4,492mAh Pixel 8a, or 4,700mAh Pixel 9; it puts that extra thickness in perspective.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="qUux9arns5iV3Jw4cCXdeB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-vs-8a-vs-7a" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a (left), Bay Google Pixel 8a (center), and Obsidian Google Pixel 7a (right) on a desk, the photo showcasing their different designs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qUux9arns5iV3Jw4cCXdeB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Compared to past A-series phones, the 6.3-inch Pixel 9a is a couple of grams lighter than the 6.1-inch Pixel 7a and 8a. For anyone used to this lineup, the 9a might <em>look</em> thicker because you don't get those rounded sides anymore, but it's more of the same.</p><p>If you're bold enough to go caseless, you'll appreciate that Google preserved the 8a's rounded corners. As I held the 9a, I appreciated the softer sides in my palm compared to the harder points of the 7a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tEvPRepyrPs4QyTneAFuQa" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-in-hand-close-up-16x9" alt="Porcelain Pixel 9a in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tEvPRepyrPs4QyTneAFuQa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In hand, it doesn't feel especially dense, and the smaller width compared to your typical 6.8-inch handheld makes it more comfortable in general.</p><p>One obvious quality of life improvement, thanks to the missing camera bar? Sliding the Pixel 9a into your pocket is easier than it's been for any Pixel since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-review">Pixel 5a</a>. No more snags and fumbling! (Don't worry, I didn't try and smuggle out a 9a in my pocket.)</p>

<p>If the new Pixel 9a camera cutout looks familiar, Google says that's on purpose. Pixel product manager Soniya Jobanputra explained that they were "inspired by water droplets, similar to the design showcase on our Pixel Watch faces."</p><p>Having reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, I can see the resemblance, but they're more like cousins than siblings. The Pixel Watch is large enough to make the droplet comparison obvious, while the 9a lens is a bit too thin for the droplet theme to be as apparent.</p><p>One similarity between them is that both make me anxious when it comes to drops or falls. This exposed camera sensor sticks out a sliver, enough to take the brunt of a fall; I'd definitely recommend using a Pixel 9a case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TcmmVrDFsS8Csxq2JVwAfB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-obsidian-close-up" alt="A close-up of the Obsidian Google Pixel 9a, the photos focused on the camera cutout and LED." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TcmmVrDFsS8Csxq2JVwAfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing I quickly noticed with the camera sensors in person is that they tend to catch dust and gunk along the edge. This also applies to any Pixel camera bar or naked S25 camera sensor, and it's less noticeable on the Porcelain, Peony, or Iris models than on the Obsidian. But it's still worth noting.</p><p>I can't judge the camera quality yet, but Google gave the Pixel 9a a new 48MP main sensor that Google says is "slightly different" from the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> but has the same core specs; check that review for a preview of the quality to expect.</p>

<p>The 9a sensor beats the 8a's with a larger aperture and Dual Pixel autofocus, but does have a smaller resolution and image sensor.</p><p>I'd assume the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> will provide a little more postprocessing oomph — along with new exclusives like Macro Focus and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>. Generally speaking, the Pixel A-series has a reputation for great budget photos thanks to Tensor, regardless of the sensor quality.</p><p>This shrunken-down sensor is at the core of the Pixel 9a's "new flat design profile." Jobanputra says they wanted to "set it apart from the other Pixel 9 phones while still remaining true to the iconic Pixel look."</p><p>From that, I took that this hard-edged, soft-cornered look might be the norm moving forward, while the camera bar will become a flagship perk. However, if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">leaked Pixel 10 renders</a> are to be believed, they suggest the next-gen will keep the camera bar.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-9a-specs-the-hardware-you-d-expect-mostly-2">Pixel 9a specs: The hardware you'd expect (mostly)</h2>

<p>While I have to save my hardware and software opinions on the Pixel 9a until my review, Google's production team shared some insights into its production that should help you know what to expect.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Pixel 9a has the "biggest battery life of any Pixel available today," bigger even than the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Google says they wanted to "eliminate battery anxiety" and that "this user segment has also been very sensitive to the battery life," prompting them to make it a priority.</p><p>As much as we loved the Pixel 8a, battery life was arguably a weak point compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">other budget phones</a>. Now, the Pixel 9a capacity beats the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>, and while it may be too expensive for the true "budget" crowd, it could still gather more attention than before.</p>

<p>In the past, teardowns have shown that the A-series uses a slightly different version of Tensor chips than the flagships. One journalist asked during the briefing if this would be the case for the 9a, and they responded that it is "the same chip that is in the 9 and the 9 Pro."</p><p>Whatever's going on with the hardware, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 benchmarks</a> fall short of Snapdragon-powered phones, and the Pixel 9a will have 4GB less RAM than the Pixel 9. That said, I think it'll be easier to stomach mid-tier performance with a mid-tier price.</p><p>Google also slightly upgraded the Pixel 9a charging speed to 23W, but that's still slower than the 27W speed that our Pixel 9 reviewer called "almost unbearably slow." And I personally wouldn't bother with 7.5W wireless charging.</p><p>As for other upgrades to highlight, the Pixel 9a slightly improves its water resistance to IP68, and the display hits the same brightness as the Pixel 9. But otherwise, you're getting the same memory, storage, connectivity standards, ports, refresh rate, and ultrawide/ selfie cameras as the Pixel 8a.</p><p>In other words, the Pixel 9a might <em>look</em> like a paradigm shift for the series, but the guts haven't changed except in predictable (and useful) ways. Even the price is unchanged: it'll cost you $499 when it launches this April.</p>

<h2 id="invest-in-a-solid-google-pixel-9a-screen-protector-2">Invest in a solid Google Pixel 9a screen protector</h2>
<p>Much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-cases">best Pixel 9a phone cases</a>, screen protectors are essential accessories for all phones. If I had to choose one, I'd say that a screen protector is more important than a case. Scratches and scrapes on the body of your phone usually only diminish resale or trade-in value, but it's not the same thing for displays.</p><p>You may end up needing a replacement screen following some nasty abrasions that render the touch input useless. This is why you need to invest in a durable Pixel 9a screen protector, be it glass or plastic.</p><p>Don't worry about straining your budget because all the best Pixel 9a screen protectors are priced below $10 for the most part. Opt for popular brands with good reputations, such as Milomdoi. Milomdoi's three-pack is the most comprehensive tempered glass screen protector kit for your Pixel 9a, complete with multiple camera lens protectors and spares. Plus, it even comes with an installation frame to help you align the glass perfectly with your Pixel 9a's 6.3-inch OLED display.</p><p>Spigen is another trusted phone accessory maker with decades of experience in the industry. The brand has a name for making high-quality phone cases and screen protectors. If you're seeking a premium-grade experience, the Spigen GlasTR EZ Fit Tempered Glass Screen Protector for the Google Pixel 9a is a good choice.</p>

<p>The Pixel A series has steadily been offering better value with each generation, thus blurring the line between it and the mainline Pixel phones more so than ever. Last year's Pixel 8a was a great example of this, and this continues as we compare the new Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9.</p><p>We weren't too thrilled that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a> received a $100 price bump over the Pixel 8, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixel 9a</a> coming in at the same price as the 8a poses an even bigger threat to the 9. For just a handful of features that remain exclusive to the 9, does it even make sense to buy it anymore now that the 9a is in town? Let's compare the main aspects of the two phones, starting with design.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9-design-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="N4Abgy8YJhp4ScmyvkaoTB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-by-tree" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a sitting upright on a mossy surface leaning against a plant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N4Abgy8YJhp4ScmyvkaoTB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is finally giving its A series phone its own identity by removing the rear camera bar. The Pixel 9a's rear camera module is just an island cutout surrounded by a flat polycarbonate surface. The design is said to be "inspired by water droplets," which is nothing new, to be honest. The camera bar has been a Pixel's identity for years, so this will take some getting used to.</p><p>The Pixel 9a comes in the standard colors of Obsidian and Porcelain, but also Peony (pink) like the 9 and a more subtle Iris (purple) shade. The 9a is a tad thicker than the 9 due to the larger battery, but it is quite a bit lighter at just 185.9 grams. The rest of the dimensions are nearly the same, so it should be as comfortable to hold and use as the Pixel 9.</p><p>The Pixel 9a finally gets upgraded to an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, putting it on par with the Pixel 9. Google says the aluminum used in the housing is 100% recycled and that the packaging is 100% free of plastics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4078px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CGPWEqNHzAqpV3JaXG7vZi" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-05.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CGPWEqNHzAqpV3JaXG7vZi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4078" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 has a weightier body at 198g, probably due to the glass back panel. It too features recycled aluminum in the construction. The 9 has a more imposing look as well compared to the 9a, thanks to the prominent island camera bar on the back.</p><p>The flat sides and rear panel are also very comfortable to hold. In our review, we noted that there's a slight curve where the frame meets the front and rear glass so it doesn't dig into your pinky finger when using it with one hand.</p><p>The Pixel 9 also comes in four colors; Peony, Wintergreen, Porcelain, and Obsidian. It too has an IP68 rating and a USB 3.2 Type-C port</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9-display-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-display-lock-screen" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in the photographer's hand. The display shows the lock screen, with the time and unlocked symbol visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a and the Pixel 9 have nearly identical display specs, save for a few things. Both feature a 6.3-inch Actua display with a Full HD+ resolution, 60-120Hz variable refresh rate, and up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>To keep costs down, though, Google has used an older Gorilla Glass 3 protective glass for the 9a, compared to Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the 9. The 9a also has an inferior contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1 vs. greater than 2,000,000:1 on the 9, on paper anyway. Finally, the 9a uses a pOLED panel compared to a regular OLED panel in the 9.</p><p>I would have liked to see Google step up the shatter protection for the glass on the 9a, as the 8a also had the same one. Given how similar the display specs of both the phones are, I imagine the usage experience should also be the same, which is to say, very good. Either way, you'll definitely want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">screen protector for the Pixel 9a</a>.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9-hardware-and-battery-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9: Hardware and battery</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="2f7mpfHXguDNwaFGso2TNB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-side-view" alt="A parallel photo of the Peony Google Pixel 9a, showcasing its thick, machine-cut design, the camera cutout, and the Google logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2f7mpfHXguDNwaFGso2TNB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3918" height="2205" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google isn't increasing the price of the Pixel 9a, which means it starts at $499 for 128GB and $559 for 256GB. You still get 8GB RAM across variants, just like before. It would have been nice to see 12GB, but it might be asking for too much at this price.</p><p>The Pixel 9a also uses the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> SoC as the Pixel 9, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-google-titan-m2-and-tensor-security-core-work">Titan M2</a> security chip. This means you should expect the same level of performance in apps, games, and AI capabilities. The Tensor G4 is nowhere close to Qualcomm's flagship chips when it comes to raw performance, but it is more power-efficient than the G3 and can handle sustained workloads longer before it begins throttling.</p><p>Battery life is going to be the Pixel 9a's highlight as it has a considerably larger 5,100mAh capacity over the 4,700mAh battery in the Pixel 9. Google is touting "30+ hours" of battery life for the 9a, which is impressive. Fast charging is present, but it's not as quick as the Pixel 9. The 9a can do up to 23W wired when using Google's 45W adapter. Wireless charging is capped at 7.5W with Qi-certified EPP chargers, but there don't seem to be faster speeds if you use the Pixel Stand.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 is priced at $799 and $899 for 128GB and 256GB of storage, respectively. However, since it's been a few months since the phone is on sale, you can find it a little less online. The Pixel 9 has 12GB of RAM across both storage tiers. The phone also uses the Tensor G4 SoC, which is capable as long as you don't do anything too intensive on it.</p><p>Despite the smaller capacity, we're quite happy with the battery life of the Pixel 9, as it is able to last a full day on one charge in our daily use. Enabling Energy Saver can extend this even more, albeit at the cost of some performance. There's 27W wired charging here and 15W wireless charging (with Pixel Stand), but both are not exactly impressive numbers for an $800 phone.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-camera-bar" alt="A close-up of the top of the Porcelain Google Pixel 9a, focused on the camera cutout with buttons and the Google logo visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera sensors on the Pixel 9a are quite different from the Pixel 9. The 9a has a 48MP main camera, 13MP ultrawide, and a 13MP selfie camera. The main camera is optically stabilized and supports 8x Super Res Zoom, but the sensor itself is smaller than the 50MP sensor in the Pixel 9. The aperture is nearly the same (f/1.7 vs. f/1.68), but overall, the Pixel 9 should be able to capture clearer low-light photos and video with less noise. We'll know for sure once we've tested the 9a.</p><p>The ultrawide camera in the Pixel 9a lacks autofocus and also has an inferior aperture, sensor size, and field of view to the Pixel 9. However, the 9a still supports features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, which is the first A series phone to do so, according to Google. Other Pixel 9 camera exclusives like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> are also supported.</p><p>Finally, the Pixel 9a has a slightly higher resolution selfie camera compared to the 10.5MP sensor on the Pixel 9. The 9a's camera even has a marginally wider field of view, but it lacks autofocus, so the depth of field behind your subject(s) might not be as shallow as what the 9 can deliver.</p><p>Video recording capabilities are similar on the Pixel 9a and Pixel 9, with 4K 60fps being the max. One thing worth noting is that the 9a can only do 4K 30fps with the front and not 60fps. Digital zoom is also better (7x) on the 9, compared to the 9a (5x).</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a will receive seven years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates, which means you should be sorted until early 2032. The Pixel 9 also gets seven years, but because it launched in August 2024, its update cycle should end in 2031. That's still a long time, whichever way you slice it, and going by Google's Android release schedule, both phones may have the same Android version by the time support ends.</p><p>The Pixel 9a ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, which means you can start exploring all the great new features right away. Both phones will get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> together later this year anyway, making them equal. The Pixel 9a should have all the great AI features that debuted with the Pixel 9 since they both share the same SoC.</p><p>There's not going to be any noticeable difference in the usage experience, either. The Pixel 9 could be slightly smoother to use due to more RAM, especially when using some of the AI features. We'll know for sure and report back in our Pixel 9a review.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-in-hand" alt="A close up of the Peony Google Pixel 9a held in hand in front of a houseplant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're looking at it purely from a value proposition, the Pixel 9a easily beats the Pixel 9 and is the one I'd recommend to most buyers. Its biggest draw over the Pixel 9 would be the (mostly) superior battery life, lower price, lighter weight, and the same performance and AI features. This makes it a strong contender to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap phone</a> in 2025.</p><p>The only thing you're losing out on would be faster charging speeds and stronger camera specs, which are not massive deal-breakers in my book. The Pixel 9's "quicker" charging isn't exactly something worth bragging about, and Google's camera post-processing algorithms are on another level altogether, so the 9a might not have to deal with <em>that</em> big of a quality loss anyway.</p><p>In my opinion, it only makes sense to get the Pixel 9 if you come across a good deal where it's under $600 or you hate the new design of the 9a. If you're going to be spending over $800, then you might as well get the Pixel 9 Pro.</p>

<p>Samsung's FE series has been an excellent choice for anyone who wanted a flagship phone, without the flagship pricing. The latest one is the Galaxy S24 FE, which has all the right upgrades we were hoping for but at the wrong price. Now that it has been a few months since it launched, you can find the base model for close to or under $500, which is what it should have cost in the first place. This also makes it a direct competitor to the new Pixel 9a, which also starts at $500.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a> offers most of the features of the more expensive Pixel 9 at a lower price. It's the same thing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> and the Galaxy S24, but here, the FE offers more value by offering better specs. Confused about the Google Pixel 9a vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE? Let's clear those doubts, shall we?</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is larger than the Pixel 9a due to the much larger screen, but it is slimmer at just 8mm. Not much could be done about the weight, though, which is 213 grams, so you will feel the heft in your pocket. The Pixel 9a has a more compact size and is quite a bit lighter at 186 grams.</p><p>The Pixel 9a comes in Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony (pink), and Iris (purple). The Galaxy S24 FE also has pastel shades of Mint, Blue, Gray, and Graphite.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 FE has a more premium build thanks to Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the back and front, while the 9a has Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and polycarbonate on the back. The Pixel 9a also has a very distinctive look, which gives it some freshness. The FE looks like any other Samsung A or S series phone, which is to say, a bit boring.</p><p>The Pixel 9a finally gets upgraded to an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, putting it on par with other flagship phones. The Galaxy S24 FE matches this, too, so both have an equal chance of survival when dunked in water.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a and Galaxy S24 FE have bright and sharp displays, but Samsung's offering is better for viewing media and gaming due to the larger size. The 6.7-inch AMOLED panel has a Full HD+ resolution, a pixel count of well over 300ppi, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of up to 1,900 nits. Having Gorilla Victus Plus glass on the FE is a nice bonus for top-end scratch protection.</p><p>The Pixel 9a has a 6.3-inch pOLED screen with a similar resolution, adaptable 120Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness rating of 2,700 nits. The display's scratch protection is pretty out of date, though, with just Gorilla Glass 3. Neither of these phones has LTPO panels, which can vary the refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz to save battery.</p><p>The cost-cutting continues with the fingerprint sensors in both models. The Pixel 9a and Galaxy S24 FE use optical fingerprint sensors and not ultrasonic ones.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2EFx9998iGenAgS3t8tQH5" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-google-search.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Google search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2EFx9998iGenAgS3t8tQH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a is priced at $499 for 128GB and $599 for 256 GB. You get 8GB of RAM across both variants. Samsung's official pricing for the Galaxy S24 FE is still $649.99 and $709.99 for 128GB and 256GB variants if you buy it from Samsung.com. On Amazon, though, certain colors of the S24 FE dip below $500 for the base model, and this phone gets good discounts during sales.</p><p>In terms of raw performance, there's no contest, as the Galaxy S24 FE should easily beat the Pixel 9a with its more potent Exynos 2400e SoC. It's essentially the same flagship 2400 chip found in the Galaxy S24 series but with a slightly lower CPU clock speed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip in the Pixel 9a isn't known for its brute strength, but it's more efficient in gaming and AI tasks than before. Samsung is the way to go if you're a gamer or need strong processing power in your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iqQmsFnXPX4jGBwouVwAGB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-obsidian-in-hand" alt="The Obsidian Google Pixel 9a held in hand, backlit by a monitor with the words "Google Pixel" flashing behind it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iqQmsFnXPX4jGBwouVwAGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a comes back swinging with a much larger battery capacity of 5,100mAh compared to the 4,700mAh in the Galaxy S24 FE. The fact that Google has managed to squeeze this in and keep the weight down is amazing. We've not tested the 9a yet, but we're confident it should last longer than the S24 FE with similar workloads.</p><p>Charging speeds are not particularly impressive on either phone. The Pixel 9a can do 23W with Google's 45W charging brick, while Samsung can do 25W. The Galaxy does support quicker wireless charging at 15W with the right charger, versus 7.5W on the 9a.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-camera-bar" alt="A close-up of the top of the Porcelain Google Pixel 9a, focused on the camera cutout with buttons and the Google logo visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE has a much better rear camera setup with a third telephoto camera, something the 9a lacks. There's a 50MP main camera with optical stabilization, a 12MP ultrawide with autofocus for macro shots, and an 8MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. The latter will probably deliver good results only under good lighting, as it is a small sensor.</p><p>The Pixel 9a lacks a telephoto, but we know Google's Super Res Zoom can deliver pretty amazing results even with digital zoom. The 9a has a 48MP main camera and a 13MP ultrawide. The Pixel also supports many AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> and Reimagine, to name a few. The S24 FE also gets some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features from the S24 series like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-instant-slow-mo-on-a-samsung-phone">Instant Slow-Mo</a>. The Galaxy can also shoot in 8K resolution, something that the Pixel  9a can't do.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LJyRTHyscKLHMPkpj7AwpB" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-chat-assist.jpg" alt="Chat Assist on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LJyRTHyscKLHMPkpj7AwpB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones offer a suite of AI features and equally long software support of seven years, so your choice would ultimately depend on what features you would actually use. The Pixel 9a comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15,</a> so you're already on the latest version the moment you take it out of the box. Another advantage is that the 9a will always be among the first phones to get the latest flavor of Android and security patches, so you'll be up to date before others.</p><p>Samsung has been pretty prompt in issuing updates of late, and we can expect the same for the Galaxy S24 FE. There are plenty of Galaxy AI features to explore here, too, like Photo Assist, Circle To Search, Sketch To Image, Live Translate, and Interpreter. One UI also offers a good amount of customization to the interface, and it's one of the better-looking skins out there.</p><p>That said, we are waiting for the Galaxy S24 FE to receive the One UI 7 update, which should begin rolling out in April.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-which-should-you-pick-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE: Which should you pick?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3894px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kSuT3zZm4ExSHmWU2a3MKB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk" alt="The Iris, Peony, Obsidian, and Porcelain Google Pixel 9a arrayed in a rainbow on a brown desk surface." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kSuT3zZm4ExSHmWU2a3MKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3894" height="2190" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're not restricted by a budget, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is the one I'd pick for the better performance, telephoto camera, and more premium build. If you can find the base model for nearly $500, it's even better. Samsung is offering the same length of software support as Google for the FE, which is another feather in its cap.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is a great option if you want a more compact phone without compromising on camera quality. It's likely to become one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> without any sales, and it should be able to deliver better battery life than the FE. It's not the best phone for gaming, and you might need a screen protector as the glass isn't as resilient as the FE.</p><p>Software will also play a big role in your decision. The 9a should always get the latest Android version before the Galaxy, and many prefer the clean, uncluttered interface of Pixels.</p>

<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-charging-speed-battery-and-more-2">Google Pixel 9a charging speed, battery, and more</h2>
<p>Following an incessant barrage of leaks over the past couple of months, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> is finally here. As the latest and the most affordable member of the Pixel 9 family, the phone brings a number of improvements and upgrades over its predecessor.</p><p>But while all that's great, among the most noteworthy upgrades is the inclusion of a 5,100mAh battery, which is a whole lot better than the 4,492mAh battery of the previous-gen model. Google claims a battery life of up to 30 hours (according to internal testing), but the real question is, how fast can you charge it once it runs out of juice?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-in-hand" alt="A close up of the Peony Google Pixel 9a held in hand in front of a houseplant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a supports up to 23W wired charging, which is certainly better than the 18W speed of the previous-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>. However, considering that a two-year-old budget phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord N30 5G</a> comes with 50W wired charging, we can't help but feel Google should've done better.</p><p>Oh, and that's not all! If you need the Pixel 9a to charge at 23W, you need to pair it with Google's 45W USB-C wall charger. And as expected, you'd have to buy that separately. Apart from that, the phone also supports 7.5W wireless charging. Sure, it's super slow, but at least it's there.</p><p>Even with its somewhat uninspiring charging speeds, we have no doubt the Pixel 9a is going to end up being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> available out there. It comes with class-leading cameras, a fresh design, feature-laden software having all sorts of AI-powered goodness, and, of course, seven years of major OS and security updates. It's a well-rounded smartphone that ticks almost all the right boxes, as long as you don't mind waiting a while for it to juice up.</p>

It is, however, Qi-certified and supports slower wireless charging in general. But you won't be able to enjoy the faster and more convenient new Qi2 standard, based on Apple's MagSafe, if you choose to wirelessly recharge this new phone.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="keeping-the-new-google-pixel-9a-charged-up-2">Keeping the new Google Pixel 9a charged up</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Google Pixel 9a</a> is an exciting new affordable device in the line that offers enticing premium features despite its lower price tag. When it comes to power, the phone, which has a 6.3-inch Actua display, is equipped with a 5,100mAh battery, the biggest battery in a Pixel phone to date. With this, you’ll get 30 or more hours of battery life per charge: that’s more than a day! You can even extend this to up to 100 hours or an impressive four days using the Extreme Battery Saver mode.</p><p>Along with support with Qi wireless charging at a rate of 7.5W with a compatible Qi charger, the Google Pixel 9a also supports fast wired charging, so you can be back up and running in no time when you’re in the red. For the fastest wired charging, which is up to 23W, you’ll need Google’s 45W USB-C charger plugged directly into a wall adapter. That adapter is sold separately.</p><p>Nonetheless, this is great news for those who want to leverage all the fantastic power-hungry features of the phone, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Google Tensor G4</a> chip, 8GB RAM, up to 2,700 nits peak brightness, HDR support, great rear, wide, ultra-wide, and front cameras, AI tools, including photo and video editing tools, a great mobile gaming experience, and more.</p><p>Google is not alone in failing to include Qi2 wireless charging in the Pixel 9a: there are few phones that truly support this new charging standard to date. With all of its other fantastic features, however, the Google Pixel 9a is likely to usurp its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best overall cheap Android phone</a> on the market.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-qi2-wireless-charging-2">What is Qi2 wireless charging?</h2>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2 wireless charging</a> is the latest charging protocol set by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), announced late in 2023. The open wireless charging standard is based on Apple’s MagSafe technology and consists of a ring of magnets that make it easier to align your device on a wireless charging surface. The result in faster charging speeds of up to 15 watts as well as more efficient charging, overall.</p><p>Note that Qi2 wireless chargers are backward compatible with Qi, so you would still be able to recharge the Google Pixel 9a on a Qi2 wireless charger or charging surface. It just wouldn’t charge at the fastest speed, continuing to charge at a rate of 7.5W.</p><p>Currently, there are only a handful of smartphones that support Qi2 charging, including the latest iPhones. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series phones are technically “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 Ready</a>,” able to charge wirelessly up to 15W. But they don’t have magnets inside, so you’d still need a compatible case to mount them properly. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> also supports magnetic charging via a case but does not support the Qi2 standard.</p>

The Pixel 9a isn't "waterproof," per se, but it is water resistant with an IP68 rating. That means it can withstand submersion in water up to 1.5 meters deep for 30 minutes. However, it does have limitations.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="can-the-google-pixel-9a-go-for-a-swim-2">Can the Google Pixel 9a go for a swim?</h2>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a shares the same IP68 rating as the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a> series. IP, or Ingress Protection, certifies that the phone meets international dust, debris, and water resistance standards. Unsurprisingly, it has this rating since Pixel phones are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>Reading the rating is simple: The first number indicates the level of protection against solid objects, with six meaning complete dust resistance. The second number, eight, signifies water resistance up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.</p><p>While this rating provides solid protection, it has its limits. You should never take your Google Pixel 9a diving, scuba diving, or into any high-pressure water environments, as the phone's rating does not protect it from those activities. However, the phone can survive an accidental drop in the tub or toilet, and it'll be fine if you get caught in a rainstorm. If you need to take your Pixel to the beach, keeping it in a waterproof bag to keep sand and salt water from getting in is best.</p><p>Even though the phone can resist those situations, you should turn it off, dry it with a microfiber cloth, and place it on a flat surface to air dry. These actions help extend your Pixel's lifespan. Ensure the pins are dry, as corrosion can damage them and cause charging problems.</p><p>While the Pixel 9a phone has an IP68 rating, wear and tear can weaken that rating over time. So, if possible, you should avoid getting your phone wet. Google offers Pixel users some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7533279" target="_blank">great advice</a> on how to keep their phones in tip-top shape. For example, they should be cautious about letting young children use their phones or not taking them into the shower, sauna, or bathtub.</p><p>Google also advises using a Bluetooth speaker to listen to music from a distance to avoid accidents. Also, try to avoid dropping your phone since, despite the screen having Corning Gorilla Glass 3, water could get in and damage the hardware.</p><p>With everything this beauty offers, why wouldn't you want to take extra care of it? The Google Pixel 9a comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, seven years of OS/security updates, and a 6.3-inch Actua display with a 1080 x 2424 resolution.</p>
