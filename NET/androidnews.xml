<hr>
<p>The highly anticipated Galaxy S25 Edge finally got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-gearing-up-to-launch-the-galaxy-s25-edge-next-week">launch date</a>, and it is coming next week. However, it still isn’t stopping the leaks, as marketing materials for the upcoming slim phone have now surfaced.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge">Android Headlines</a> has managed to grab official-looking marketing material of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> alongside renders of its official accessories, which gives us a clear picture of what to expect. While we have already seen the actual device at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series launch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC 2025</a>, very little about the device is known until now.</p>

<p>The leaked materials indicate a slimmer design, which is said to be “ultra sleek and premium,” and at least three colorways are expected: black, silver, and a possible blue hue. Even with the slimmer form factor, the device boasts a durable design with a titanium finish and features an ultra-tough glass protection on both sides of the handset. The durability here also includes an IP68 rating, which means it should notably feature solid dust and water resistance.</p><p>On the back, the S25 Edge marks a departure from the conventional triple camera array as seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">S25 Plus</a> models. It comes with a new dual camera visor, and the latest leak showcases that it is a 200MP primary lens, which is a wide-angle camera with 2x optical quality zoom paired with a 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens. For selfies, the device will have a 12MP shooter.</p><p>The materials, however, still don't specify the processor and the battery capacity, but instead hint at them being a powerful processor and an all-day battery promise despite being the slimmest Galaxy phone.</p>

<p>Alongside the specs, the accessories accompanying the upcoming Galaxy S25 Edge may include silicone cases in black, blue, and gray color variants. Additionally, users can also expect Samsung’s popular Kindsuit cases in blue, light gray, and gray color options. Lastly, there’s also a transparent case that could go with the Galaxy S25 Edge next to an anti-reflective screen protector as well.</p><p>As mentioned, the Galaxy S25 Edge will be launched early next week, May 12 at 8 p.m. ET, to be precise. It will be a virtual Galaxy Unpacked event, and consumers can already reserve the Galaxy S25 Edge. Those who opt in will receive a $50 Samsung credit.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I was excited when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k9-pro-ess-review">started using the K9 Pro</a> three years ago; the high-end DAC had everything I needed, and it did a great job driving my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-lcd-x-review">Audeze LCD-X</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/massdrop-x-focal-elex-review">Focal Elex</a>. With the flagship K19, Fiio proved that it could deliver something that held its own against the best in this category.</p><p>Now we have the K17. This is billed as the upgrade to the K9 Pro, and it comes with AKM's latest AK4191EX and AK4499EQ DACs, along with a custom amp that delivers 4000mW of power, and all the analog and digital connectors you need. The K17 costs $899, but because of the tariffs, the price has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-K17-Headphone-Amplifier-AK4499EX/dp/B0DTJ86XF6">increased to $949 on Amazon</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cwx2oNiH35wr3MY2rAfMTE" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cwx2oNiH35wr3MY2rAfMTE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's good to see the internals get a refresh, what I like the most about the K17 is the design; Fiio went with retro styling, and the DAC looks absolutely stunning. It has a white color scheme with chunky dials and knobs, and a 3.93-inch color LCD panel with a 240x1020 resolution, and LED lights on the knobs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="UFKDJozy5b5RSYr77WvwSE" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UFKDJozy5b5RSYr77WvwSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio rolled out utilitarian designs in the past, and while the K9 Pro had plenty to offer, it doesn't hold a candle to the K17 in terms of the design aesthetic. Fiio did a fantastic job in this regard, and I like the K17's design better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19</a>. There are vents at the sides as well as the top, and you get better cooling — this was an issue on the K9 Pro.</p>

<p>The dials at the front let you change modes and adjust gain easily, and the menu system is significantly easier to navigate this time around. You get the usual 6.35mm, 4.4mm, and XLR connectors, and there's a USB-C in up front that allows you to easily connect to source devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kWZ6aGK8vkraSMbX49ZA4E" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kWZ6aGK8vkraSMbX49ZA4E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's something about the tactility that you get with using large buttons and dials that's just missing digitally; this is a clear point of differentiation with the K17, and a big reason why I like the DAC so much. Just like the K19, you get a remote control that makes it easier to change modes, adjust volume, tweak EQ, and mute the device. The remote itself is identical, with the only difference being that the Bluetooth button is missing in spite of the unit having the same Bluetooth 5.1 modem.</p>

<p>Round the back, there's USB-C in, USB-A, Gigabit Ethernet, line in and line out, balanced XLR out, coaxial in and out along with optical in/out. There really isn't anything missing when it comes to connectivity, and Fiio deserves credit in this area. Similar to the K9 Pro, you get a voltage toggle at the back that lets you switch between 110V and 230V (I used the latter as I'm in India).</p>

<p>Fiio is once again offering the 31-band PEQ feature that debuted on the K19, and it is just as effective. It uses an M21586Q DSP and ES9821Q ADC, and you get granular control when it comes to tweaking the sound. It has the same QCC5125 Bluetooth modem, and this time, Fiio went with a discrete amp solution that's driven by the Onsemi MJE243G and MJE253G.</p>

<p>Clearly, a lot of thought went into the design and internals of the K17, and the final result is a DAC that's much better than the K9 Pro. A cool feature is the ability to play music when you connect a USB drive or HDD to the DAC — no other source needed. The DAC handles PCM up to 768kHz/32-bit and DSD512 natively, and 384kHz/32-bit and DSD256 when using a local source. Oh, and it is Roon ready, making it a great choice if you use the platform.</p>

<p>With the ability to deliver 4000mW of power at 32Ω over the balanced 4.4mm connector and 1850mW at 32Ω via the single-ended 6.35mm port, the K17 is able to drive any headset with relative ease. I didn't see any issues with the Audeze LCD-X, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze MM-500</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">Fiio FT5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa19-review">Fiio FA19 IEMs</a>, and the Focal Elex.</p>

<p>Like the K19, the K17 has a neutral soundstage that doesn't add any dynamics to the sound, allowing headsets and IEMs to shine. It was delightful to use the DAC with the FT5 and the recent FT1 Pro, with both delivering an energetic bass, clearly-defined mids, and a smooth treble. The K17 nails the technicalities, and you get accurate imaging and great resolution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4861px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MP6LvXKJfi4HUfBMJ2d36E" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MP6LvXKJfi4HUfBMJ2d36E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4861" height="2738" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After testing over a dozen Fiio DACs, I can safely say that the K17 is its best yet. I like the design better than the K19, and if anything, the K17 sounds better when using the same headsets. Overall, this is an excellent upgrade to the K9 Pro, and if you need a DAC that looks as good as it sounds, this is definitely the one to get.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung is fast-tracking Galaxy S25 production, adding 800,000 more units this May, mostly the Ultra model.</li><li>There are 1.5 million units planned for the S25 Ultra, with the regular S25 and Plus at 1.3 million and 500,000, respectively.</li><li>There's a 90-day no-tariff window, and Samsung is racing to ship before the door slams shut.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung isn't waiting around to see what Washington cooks up next. The company is firing up production lines to crank out an extra 800,000 Galaxy S25s this month, with a big focus on the top-tier S25 Ultra.</p><p>Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5258" target="_blank">The Elec</a> reports that Samsung is hitting the gas on smartphone production (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-increases-galaxy-s25-production-tariffs-3555681/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). The company has reportedly told suppliers that it is aiming to build 15.8 million smartphones, including 3.3 million <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> units, up from 2.5 million last month.</p><p>For May’s Galaxy S25 lineup, Samsung is putting the spotlight on the Ultra, with 1.5 million units in the pipeline. The regular S25 follows with 1.3 million, and the Plus rounds things out with 500,000.</p>
<h2 id="tariff-talk-is-heating-up-2">Tariff talk is heating up</h2>
<p>Lately, talk around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">tariffs and trade rules has been heating up</a>, indicating major shifts in how imports are handled in the U.S. In response, companies are raising prices, moving production around, and rushing shipments to beat any new deadlines.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-12" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the moment, there’s a 90-day window giving companies a breather from these tariffs, and Samsung is wasting no time. The company is clearly trying to get as much out the door as possible before the break ends and the costs kick in.</p><p>The real headache with the whole tariff mess is how unpredictable it is. After months of trade tension bubbling over, we’ve seen some serious tariffs hit, especially targeting Asian countries that do a lot of the world’s manufacturing.</p><p>Some of these charges are light-ish at 10%, but others skyrocket up to a wild 145% on certain Chinese goods. That kind of rollercoaster makes it nearly impossible for companies to plan ahead.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-is-playing-it-smart-2">Samsung is playing it smart</h2>
<p>When the rules keep shifting with no warning, it’s less about smart strategy and more about staying on your toes. Samsung’s current scramble to pump out and ship devices while the coast is clear is a classic example.</p><p>Right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung devices</a> are still in the clear. But with trade rules changing at the drop of a hat, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-tariffs-are-a-great-reason-to-keep-the-phone-you-have-as-long-as-you-can">playing it safe makes a lot of sense</a>.</p><p>According to The Elec, Samsung is aiming to roll out a hefty 16.2 million smartphones and tablets this May alone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qGD8Fn8ecjU6sko2Pt7Ny8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-13" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qGD8Fn8ecjU6sko2Pt7Ny8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the FT1 Pro, it's clear that Fiio took all of its learnings in the last two years to create a product that truly stands out. The headphones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-FT1-Pro-Headphones-Sensitivity/dp/B0DM61CHW6">cost $279 on Amazon</a>, with the regular FT1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-FT1-Closed-Back-Headphones-Detachable/dp/B0D9QD4Y2P">going up to $209</a> on the retailer due to the ongoing tariffs situation. Even then, they're a decent value when you consider just how good they sound.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="tkNsJ8zGyQXAarBThRVkU8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-4" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tkNsJ8zGyQXAarBThRVkU8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FT1 Pro share a similar aesthetic as the rest of their siblings, and while you don't get a wood-backed design like the FT1, they're comfortable to wear, and don't cause any fatigue even with extended use. Coming in at 374g, they're not heavy, and Fiio did a good job with the suede headband lining and liberal usage of steel in the construction of the headphones.</p>

<p>The headband allows for a good rotation, and I didn't see any issues in getting a comfortable fit. The protein leather pads come with a fabric lining, and the breathable design ensures there's no hot spot while using the FT1 Pro. The pads are slightly angled, and they fit well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EEfFJ6uE2d5DwqXbaDtuU8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-11" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EEfFJ6uE2d5DwqXbaDtuU8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FT1 Pro connect via 3.5mm jacks, and Fiio bundles two cables in the box; one with a 3.5mm plug, and the other being a balanced 4.4mm cable. Like the FT1, you get a high-quality storage box that makes it easy to take the FT1 Pro anywhere.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YUUp9xY9eGPevdnJEQZiz8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-14" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YUUp9xY9eGPevdnJEQZiz8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the FT1 Pro use Fiio's custom planar drivers, and combined wit the open-back nature of the headphones, you get a distinctly different sound to the regular model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rFDxfQKC5d95yprqNkfkh8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-17" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rFDxfQKC5d95yprqNkfkh8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FT1 have a clearly exaggerated bass with a distinct rumble and energy, and the FT1 Pro have a better balance; the bass isn't quite as vibrant, but you still get plenty of vigor, and the switch to planar drivers means the bass transient is faster. If you predominantly listen to bass-heavy music, I'd still suggest the FT1 — they're designed to have a weighty low-end — but if you want a neutral sound while still getting decent bass, the FT1 Pro are the way to go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kNRGtinLMTEF5GCzB5CJP8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-6" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNRGtinLMTEF5GCzB5CJP8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mid-bass is tight and focused, and you get a clean mid-range where the vocals are detailed and full-bodied. Instruments have good tonality, and there's a bit of warmth to the sound that makes using the headphones highly enjoyable. This is where the FT1 Pro come into their own, and the sound quality is similar to the HD6XX but with the benefit of planar drivers.</p>

<p>There's a good sense of airiness with the treble, but you don't get any harshness or sibilance, which is good. The soundstage is definitely wider than the FT1 (as you'd imagine), and there's better imaging as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5174px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="eqgRykZURmZWgFvYMZcUJ8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-1" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqgRykZURmZWgFvYMZcUJ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5174" height="2914" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The one thing to note is that the FT1 Pro need a powerful source — I tested them with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19</a> — and there was a noticeable difference in imaging when I switched to a portable source. So if you're eyeing these, I'd suggest using an amp that has a decent amount of power. It's not that they're hard to drive, but you'll need to good source to unlock the full potential of the sound.</p>

<p>Overall, Fiio did a magnificent job with the FT1 Pro. They have a neutral sound that lends itself well to diverse genres, and you get a comfortable fit. While they're costlier in the U.S. because of the tariffs, they're still a good option if you want a planar headset on a budget.</p>

<hr>
<p>Gemini Live first rolled out for personal Google accounts last year, but users with Google Workspace accounts for work or school couldn't access the handy feature. That's changing, as Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/05/gemini-live-in-depth-two-way-conversations.html" target="_blank">announced</a> today, May 9, that Gemini Live's conversation features are reaching the Gemini mobile app for Workspace customers. Users can now have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">multimodal conversations with Gemini Live</a> in real time, using their voice, camera, or screen.</p><p>Notably, administrators can't individually restrict access to Gemini Live for their employees or students. It is available by default when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> app access is enabled, with no admin control for Live specifically. Gemini Apps Activity is also automatically enabled when Gemini app access is permitted by a Workspace, and users can't manually delete their activity.</p><p>Gemini Live is restricted to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Workspace</a> users who are 18 years or older, so some student accounts may be unable to use it due to age requirements. For personal Google accounts, the minimum age to use Gemini is 13 years old.</p>

<p>Google outlines the differences in Gemini's privacy and data collection policies for work and school accounts in the blog post.</p><p>"Currently, if you use the Gemini web app or mobile app with your work or school account, your Gemini Apps Activity is turned on and your conversation history is retained for 18 months," the post explains.</p><p>Even if you delete Gemini chats, the data is still saved in your Gemini Apps Activity on Google servers.</p><p>"For work users who have access to Gemini Apps as an additional service, while Gemini Apps Activity is on, Google collects your Gemini Apps conversations and other information you provide to improve and develop Google products and services and machine-learning technologies," the post continues.</p><p>The rollout is beginning today for all Google Workspace domains, but it could take up to 15 days for full feature visibility. It's available for the following Google Workspace plans and add-ons:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Business</strong> Starter, Standard, Plus</li><li><strong>Enterprise </strong>Starter, Standard, Plus</li><li><strong>Education</strong> Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus</li><li><strong>Frontline</strong> Starter and Standard</li><li><strong>Nonprofits</strong></li><li><strong>Essentials, Enterprise Essentials, and Enterprise Essentials Plus</strong></li><li><strong>Gemini Add-ons</strong><ul><li>Gemini <strong>Business</strong></li><li>Gemini <strong>Enterprise</strong></li><li>Gemini <strong>Education</strong></li><li>Gemini <strong>Education Premium</strong></li></ul></li></ul>
<p>The expanded Gemini Live availability comes ahead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O 2025</a>, a developer conference happening this month that will surely involve AI and Workspace features.</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. DOJ won its antitrust case against Google, but the two sides recently finished their remedies hearing, where each made their case as to what changes Google should have to make to its business.</li><li>The DOJ wants Google to cease promotional deals involving Google Search and to divest the Chrome browser.</li><li>Google is responding to the government's proposals by calling them "extreme," and saying they would "hurt consumers."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A U.S. District Court judge ruled in August 2024 that Google's search engine dominance was attributed to antitrust violations, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-pulse-google-is-now-a-monopoly-but-nothing-will-really-change">saying that "Google is a monopolist."</a> That isn't the end of the high-profile antitrust case between the U.S. government and Google, however.</p><p>Now, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Google are both sharing proposed remedies with Judge Amit Mehta, who will eventually decide what measures the company will need to take to correct its monopoly. Following the weeks-long remedies hearing, the DOJ recommended the court <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-be-forced-to-split-up-chrome-and-android-over-antitrust-concerns">require Google to divest Chrome</a> — its browser with close ties to Google Search — and cease promotional agreements that put Search in the hands of users.</p><p>Google now has a public response to the DOJ's proposed remedies. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-may-2025/" target="_blank">blog post</a> published today, May 9, the company called the government's remedies "extreme." Google claims being forced to sell Chrome and stop creating promotional agreements for Search would "hurt consumers and America's tech leadership."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we wrapped our case in the DOJ search remedies trial. Some key points from court this week ⬇️<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1920613963244372406">May 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Specifically, Google pushes back on the concept that promotional agreements for Search are inherently anti-competitive. This is largely in reference to Google's deal with Apple, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-seeks-to-defend-google-search-distribution-deal">was brought up during the trial</a>. This promotional agreement in particular pays Apple $20 billion annually to make Google Search the default browser on iPhone.</p><p>The DOJ wants these payments to stop, but Google says these kinds of deals are simply part of the evolving nature of competition. The company cites Apple's deal with OpenAI and Motorola's deal with Perplexity and Microsoft as evidence of other brands taking similar steps to get their products in the hands of users.</p>

<p>During the trial and remedies hearings, brands paid by Google to make Search the default search engine took defense of the Mountain View-based company. Apple's Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue told the court that AI is already making Google less of an antitrust threat. Additionally, Mozilla executives said that without Google's search payments, Firefox would be "put out of business"</p><p>Meanwhile, the blog post claims divesting Chrome "would break it" and make it "a shadow of the current Chrome," in Google's view.</p><p>The conclusion of the remedies hearing in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">United States of America v. Google</a> means that we're one step closer to learning what changes Google will have to make to its business. Judge Mehta has now heard arguments from both the DOJ and Google as to what those measures will be, and is expected to order remedies this summer.</p>

<hr>
<p>The streaming service, Max, is reportedly preparing to officially kick off its crackdown on users who are sharing passwords.</p><p>In a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/max-password-sharing-more-assertive-blocking-users-1236390795/">Variety</a>, the publication cites Warner Bros. Discovery CEO and president of global streaming and games, JB Perrette, when stating 2025 is the year for its strong crackdown on password sharing. During the company's Q1 report, Perrette reportedly stated its efforts against sharing accounts will be gradual.</p><p>Perrette said Max will begin displaying messages to users "softly" before becoming more "visible to subscribers over the months to come." What's more, the company states Max will become "more assertive" in its urge to push users away from password sharing "over the course of the back half of the year and really into ’26."</p><p>As the publication also notes, Max's CEO (and the service in general) is encouraging users into its recently launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.max.com/us/Answer/Detail/000002598">Extra Members add-on</a>.</p><p>Account owners can pay an additional $7.99 per month to share their subscription with someone who doesn't live in their household. Those who do not comply will face repercussions, such as disabled features. More importantly, WBD's Perrette states the full crackdown on password sharing will take anywhere from a year to 18 months to complete.</p>

<p>WBD's Max first highlighted its interest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/max-prepares-password-sharing-crackdown">password sharing crackdown</a> early last year. Perrette was a part of those formal announcements in 2024, stating, "We think, relative to the scale of our business, it’s a meaningful opportunity." At its core, Max saw the success <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix/netflix-stock-plummet-password-sharing">services like Netflix</a> had with its crackdown and eventual implementation of extra members.</p><p>Those details came off the back of Max's striking loss of $55 million in Q4 2023.</p><p>A few months later, in December 2024, Perrette <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/max-password-sharing-crackdown-to-begin-details">returned to tease</a> a much stronger crackdown in 2025. Much of what's been confirmed by Perrette through Variety echoes what was said late last year. Max's interest in starting gently before becoming more "assertive" and its Netflix-like extra members add-on, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/max-launches-extra-member-add-799mo-across-subscription-tiers-us">debuted last month</a>. We've seen much of the same roll in for the likes of Disney Plus and Hulu, as well, so Max following the trend hasn't been a surprise.</p><p>Generating more revenue can be seen a core driver for this, given Max has stated such outright in the past. However, Variety highlights its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-adds-5-3-million-streaming-subscribers-q1-loss-1236390685/">Q1 2025 analytics</a>, which shows Max gained over 5 million subscribers, helping it cut down on its major losses.</p>

<ul><li>Google recently highlighted the launch of AI-powered warnings in Chrome for Android.</li><li>Thanks to Gemini's intelligence and on-device machine learning, Google says Android users will receive alerts about potential scams through notifications.</li><li>Google updated Chrome's Safety Check on Android last September, giving it improved background tasks and an early version of notification alerts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's starting to rollout a new security feature on Android that'll help ward off malicious threats when browsing.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/how-were-using-ai-to-combat-the-latest-scams/">Keyword post</a>, Google highlighted the new lengths it's going to protect its Chrome for Android users, thanks to machine learning. Its software will now hone in on "scams, spam, and unwanted notifications" from malicious websites. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2025/05/fighting-unwanted-notifications-with.html">subsequent blog post</a> explains Chrome will soon leverage a local, on-device machine learning model to "analyze" website notifications.</p><p>Much of this model's prowess comes from Gemini. Essentially, Google states the model's available synthetic data, which it used for training, was "evaluated against real notifications Chrome security team collected by subscribing to a variety of websites."</p><p>If Chrome on Android has flagged a notification as malicious, users will see the site's name, a caution icon, and a message warning them against interacting with it. Chrome will then offer two options: Unsubscribe and Show Notification.</p><p>Chrome's AI-backed intelligence could've gotten things wrong, which is the reason behind the Show Notification option. Users can still see what it deems malicious and tell it otherwise if the alert is fine.</p>

<p>These malicious notification protections hit Android (mobile) first; however, Google says it will look into expanding its coverage in the future.</p><p>Additionally, Google highlighted Gemini Nano's assistance with Chrome's Enhanced Protection mode on desktop. The company states it's already using the AI to help protect users from tech support scams when browsing. Gemini Nano gives users "instant" insight into risky websites, which enables the browser to better protect users.</p><p>Google adds that it will look into bringing these capabilities to Android, as well as the ability to combat more scam types.</p><p>Last September, Google announced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-safety-check-defense-boost-android">major Safety Check update</a> for its Android Chrome users. Safety Check's background tasks were updated to ensure you're running the latest browser software and the ability to scan your passwords for potential security risks. Moreover, Safety Check will consider your installed extensions (on desktop) and warn you if any of them are working against you.</p><p>Interestingly, the company previously highlighted Chrome's ability on Android to check for potentially dangerous notifications. However, given the recent updates to the function with Gemini and the inclusion of on-device machine learning, this ability is picking up a noteworthy enhancement to combat scams and more types of spam.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors from within an early One UI 8 build suggest Samsung is looking to bring a "Quick" button to the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</li><li>Other leaked imagery claims the Watch 8 and 8 Classic could adopt the Ultra's "squircle" design.</li><li>The batteries for the Galaxy Watch 8 series reportedly appeared in SafetyKorea's database for certification, while a One UI 8 Watch leak purports Gemini's influence.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors end the week with speculation on Samsung's supposed changes for the Galaxy Watch 8 series.</p><p>Alongside tipster AssembleDebug, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-squircle-design-quick-button-apk-teardown-3555946/">Android Authority</a> states Samsung's early One UI 8 code holds clues about the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series. Specifically, the post highlights the current animation images within the software, which showcase the addition of a "Quick" button for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8</a> Classic. This change reportedly takes the Classic's physical button tally to three, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.</p><p>While the leaked graphics don't show this button for the base Watch 8, the imagery highlights another significant change: an Ultra-like redesign.</p><p>The tipster discovered that the Galaxy Watch 8 (codename "Fresh 8") and the Watch 8 Classic ("Wise 8") feature a squircle design similar to Samsung's 2024 Ultra model. "Squircle" concerns a watch's square base with a circular watch face on top. While both models reportedly sport this new shape, they're not equal.</p><p>The leaked image suggests the Watch 8 could have slimmer bezels, while the Watch 8 Classic could be slightly thicker. This is something we've seen happen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 and 6 Classic</a>. Moreover, it's unclear if Samsung has retained the rotating bezels on the Classic (though there's hope).</p>

<p>Lastly, the publication purports the 8 Classic could get an upgrade to its vibration pattern support. In short, this might make its vibrations a little stronger, furthering suspicions around a more Ultra-like model.</p><p>The latest leak is pretty substantial in terms of the Watch 8 series' outlook; however, in early April, the pair reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/new-leak-hints-at-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8s-existence">showed up in SafetyKorea's database</a>. Samsung was reportedly spotted passing its next series through its certification loops, which brought the existence of a pair of watches to our attention. The battery model numbers in the database were EB-BL330ABY and EB-BL505ABY for the Watch 8 and 8 Classic, respectively.</p><p>The reported battery size of the former is 435mAh, leaving the capacity of the other unknown for now.</p><p>A recent leak from earlier this week touched on the expected Gemini integration in Wear OS, but through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/alleged-one-ui-8-watch-leak-samsung-gemini-actions">eyes of One UI 8 Watch</a>. A teardown showed Google is preparing to bring Gemini "Actions" to its wearable software, which will likely wind up on Samsung's next-generation watches. Several strings suggest Gemini can help users move items on their calendars, summarize emails, and more.</p><p>Samsung is expected to debut its Galaxy Watch 8 series during its summer Unpacked.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>When you look at the Galaxy S25 lineup, Samsung has pretty much reached the peak. It's partially why I think the company is even venturing down a "new" path with the upcoming Galaxy S25 Edge; there's nowhere else to go. However, the same can't be said about either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold or Z Flip lineups</a>.</p><p>We still don't have flagship cameras in a phone that costs around $2,000, plus battery life is good for a couple of months and then becomes fear-inducing. Not to mention that the paltry battery takes forever to charge, because Samsung is still seemingly afraid of offering charging speeds faster than 25W. That's despite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> supporting up to 45W chargers, which is still far behind much of the competition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gMaGt99dEXzJNzg2UkMEhP" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-15.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs Fold 5 crease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gMaGt99dEXzJNzg2UkMEhP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and that same competition already figured out how to ditch the crease, while Samsung continues acting like having the Grand Canyon in the middle of a screen is okay. At the same time, it's making appearances at different events and conferences to showcase the kinds of upgrades that I've been begging for.</p><p>That pretty much covers the meat and potatoes of my frustrations with what Samsung has done, or really hasn't done, over the past couple of years. So, with all of that in mind, I've been finding it increasingly difficult to get even remotely excited about the prospect of a tri-fold (bi-fold?) from Samsung.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uxXRHZUDqc8RXw9JWFUXtH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxXRHZUDqc8RXw9JWFUXtH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Every time I see a picture or video of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, I'm immediately put in a sort of trance, just because it looks absolutely beautiful. Then, reality sets in, and I'm forced to be reminded of where I live and that the Mate XT isn't actually viable for me.</p><p>Frankly, I don't know if I have the confidence that Samsung can come anywhere near what the Mate XT offers. Well, I take that back. I believe that Samsung is fully capable of designing a phone that's even better than Huawei, but would only do so as a limited release (i.e., the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="5w4UFrBYVuRungQLtvcQc5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-promo-render.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5w4UFrBYVuRungQLtvcQc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm suspecting that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-teases-a-wild-new-foldable-phone-dropping-in-late-2025">Galaxy "G" Fold</a> will look fairly similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a>, just with an extra hinge and wider screen. That's to say it'll be awkward, chunky, and while the software will probably be pretty solid, the hardware will leave a bit to be desired.</p><p>It's pretty obvious that Samsung has become complacent. It made massive leaps and improvements before some companies even got started, only to follow that up with a series of iterative updates, following the same cadence that we see with traditional slab phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.00%;"><img id="5aYjNxDSmKsCaigNapZpbF" name="Samsung-Flex-G" alt="Samsung Flex G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5aYjNxDSmKsCaigNapZpbF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="392" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Etnews)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, it's not like Samsung doesn't have an opportunity here to reassert its position as a leader in the foldable space. And what better way to do so than with the launch of a completely new product?</p><p>There have been a few leaks that give us an idea of what to expect from the Galaxy G Fold, much of which suggests it will share some DNA with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PandaFlashPro">@PandaFlashPro</a>, the hinge mechanism is "similar," while the "speakers drivers are the exact same."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8yVVWui3NnjnCSU96atTn4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8yVVWui3NnjnCSU96atTn4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, there is one thing that won't be the same, supposedly, and that's the crease. Samsung is rumored to finally give us an almost-crease-less display with the Fold 7 that matches up with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>. Unfortunately, rumors point to this not being the case with the Galaxy G Fold, leaving me to assume that it will look more like the Fold 6. This will probably have an impact on potential sales for a phone that already has a steep hill to climb.</p><p>As for the software, if we ignore the debacle that has been the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-launch-messy">One UI 7 rollout</a>, I'm actually not worried about that. It might miss out on a few things here and there, but by and large, Samsung <em>arguably</em> offers the best foldable software experience. I'm sure there will be bugs and quirks, but it likely (hopefully) won't have many growing pains as we've seen in the past.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yJF6kbcTg82QcDvhLffvCi" name="Samsung Foldable OLED" alt="Samsung Foldable OLED demo panels at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yJF6kbcTg82QcDvhLffvCi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I would <em>love</em> for Samsung to do is shock the world and put all of its available resources into designing the "ultimate" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>. A phone that truly has no compromises, meaning flagship camera hardware, a crease-less and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-friendly</a> tri-fold display, a larger and thinner battery that also charges faster, and hell, figure out a way to get the S Pen in there.</p><p>I have little doubt that there isn't already such a device hidden away in the depths of Samsung's R&D department. Such a phone will probably never see the light of day, as it doesn't make financial sense for Samsung to release a phone that will lose the company money. But if there's one company that <em>could</em> do something like that without worrying about many repercussions, it's Samsung.</p>

Where One UI 6 Watch felt relatively minor, One UI 8 Watch already feels like it's packing two years' worth of changes into one, and it has me really excited about what's to come for Samsung's Galaxy smartwatches.</p><p>While we can probably look forward to some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-squircle-design-quick-button-apk-teardown-3555946/">alleged design changes</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>, Samsung may be focusing as much effort on software to help give its watches an edge this year. And after a relatively safe One UI 6 Watch update, this feels like the push it needs to shake things up..</p><p>Here's a relatively brief rundown of everything that has been rumored or leaked thus far regarding One UI 8 Watch:</p>
<h2 id="what-we-know-so-far-about-one-ui-8-watch-2">What we know so far about One UI 8 Watch</h2>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Wear OS Weekly</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o8KRGSTt4mbFxn3wdtWvtU" name="lloyd-wear-os-weekly.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot Lloyd wearing a Galaxy Watch and Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8KRGSTt4mbFxn3wdtWvtU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/wear-os-weekly">weekly column</a> focuses on the state of Wear OS, from new developments and updates to the latest apps and features we want to highlight.</p></div></div>
<p>First, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-one-ui-6-watch-to-one-ui-8-watch/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> reported that we'd skip from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5#section-one-ui-6-watch" target="_blank">One UI 6 Watch</a>, which focused on AI and health tools but made very few system-level changes, to One UI 8 Watch to align it with Galaxy phones' One UI 8.</p><p>Then we started seeing the real meat of the update. We knew Gemini was coming to Wear OS, but a leaked One UI 8 Watch build showed the option to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/alleged-one-ui-8-watch-leak-samsung-gemini-actions">add Gemini actions</a> linked to other apps like Gmail, Calendar, and Weather — beyond Assistant's current capabilities.</p><p>After that, Android Authority dove into this build's AFK and found evidence of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-now-bar-now-brief-galaxy-watch-3555509/">Now Bar and Now Brief coming to Wear OS</a>. It would default as a blank placeholder icon on your watch face until you use a "double-pinch" gesture to expand it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1901px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Fsutg9wGqLoKo8tMvXEvW3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Now-Bar" alt="An extracted image from One UI 8 Watch showing what the Now Bar on a Galaxy Watch will look like." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fsutg9wGqLoKo8tMvXEvW3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1901" height="1069" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An extracted image of the Now Bar in One UI 8 Watch </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to the code, the Now Bar on Wear OS can specifically show contextual suggestions, directions, media controls, the Now Brief, sports scores, and health updates.

<p>Samsung promised that its next Galaxy Watch will have an "innovative design" during its latest earnings call, so it's possible the Watch 8 will have a brand new look to go with the new software. Leaks are pointing to a squircle design on both the standard and Classic models to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, which is nice to see after getting the same Galaxy Watch design over the last four generations.</p><p>Fortunately, if you're really excited about a Galaxy Watch 8 Classic bringing back the rotating bezel and retro Samsung style, the leaks suggest this is something we can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-classic-bluetooth-cert-spotted">probably look forward to</a>! However, aside from the facelift, Classic watches typically have the same hardware as the base model.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Samsung's One UI Watch is designed to mirror the phone software in looks and actions, like swiping to access the app drawer and quick settings. Where stock Wear OS is intentionally clean and simplified, Samsung's version sticks to what Android fans know.</p><p>I'm not sure how much of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>'s personality made its way into last year's Wear OS update. Stylistically, it didn't seem that different. And of course, nothing is official yet, and we'll have to wait and see what we get when Wear OS 6 and One  UI 8 are officially announced. Still, it's a relief to see Samsung cramming so many familiar phone tools into its watch to bring them into closer sync.</p>

<hr>
<p>If you are a Dbrand consumer, chances are you are already familiar with the Robot skin that the company offers for its wide range of products. While it was earlier launched in 2019, the company is bringing back a new avatar.</p><p>It is dubbed Glowbot and is making a comeback for a limited time, and the best part of the new avatar is, it glows in the dark — thanks to the use of photoluminescent vinyl, the company notes in a press release. While it looks like a conventional Robot skin, it brings in a vibrant green hue in the dark.</p>

Additionally, for a limited time, Dbrand is also offering a complimentary UV light with each Glowbot skin.</p><p>In other Dbrand news, the company not long ago has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/dbrand-launches-grass-like-cases-and-skins">launched</a> a unique "Touch Grass" skins and mobile cases that actually feel like real grass.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rUcAn7APqYjABbqftGHmRb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rUcAn7APqYjABbqftGHmRb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Blast 2 has a cleaner design than its predecessor, and it is considerably bigger; it comes in at 19.18lb, and you can get a decent workout while getting this thing around. It's definitely the heaviest Bluetooth speaker I used, and while it is gargantuan, I like the changes to the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XtsHUjpuxFn6wUP7DHpXPb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XtsHUjpuxFn6wUP7DHpXPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RGB lighting at the sides is now a single bar instead of individual LEDs, and the overall design looks much more polished. After six months of use, I don't have any negatives to point out when it comes to the design or build quality. The back of the unit houses the AC port that's used to charge the internal battery, and it has USB-A and USB-C out, giving you the ability to charge your phone or accessories at 10W.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SW4ssT3GNhgoqVSFEjM7Jb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SW4ssT3GNhgoqVSFEjM7Jb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tribit retained IP67 dust and water resistance, so you can use the StormBox Blast 2 at the pool without any issues. The ports at the back are housed behind a silicone protective cover, and you get a large carrying handle that makes it somewhat easy to lug this beast of a speaker around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3vXpDVnbytsYfEiX2v5nKb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vXpDVnbytsYfEiX2v5nKb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are three things I need in a portable Bluetooth speaker: built-in controls, good sound, and long-lasting battery. The StormBox Blast 2 ticks all those boxes; there are volume and music playback controls at the top, along with Bluetooth pairing, battery level indicator, and XBass mode. You can even pair two of these in stereo if you really want wall-shaking sound that's sure to annoy your neighbors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qXNWzUq7hk4dBGiTbqtRUb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qXNWzUq7hk4dBGiTbqtRUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the StormBox Blast 2 gets <em>loud</em> — incredibly loud. You get an 80W subwoofer paired to dual 15W tweeters and two 45W mid-range drivers, leading to a total power of 200W when plugged in. While using battery power, it goes down to 180W, and that's still significantly higher than any other portable speaker I used.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TCVPTJxXSkQNB4YP8TJRRb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TCVPTJxXSkQNB4YP8TJRRb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to being loud, the sound is detailed; you get energetic bass with a big rumble, good mid-range, and clean treble. Vocals come across a little harsh, but on the whole, the sound is highly engaging. I used it in the living room, and didn't have to increase volume beyond 50%, and the massive size combined with the sound quality makes this the ideal party speaker.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2DtnYY9aCcCnyqz8pgKTSb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2DtnYY9aCcCnyqz8pgKTSb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the XBass mode does a great job boosting the low-end, and you can easily make out the difference when the mode is active. If you don't like the way the Blast 2 sounds out of the box, you can use Tribit's app to customize the sound profile; there's no 10-band EQ, but you can tweak the bass, mids, and treble according to your tastes, or select presets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="thzV9kNtUqZGWHXw6VW5Nb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/thzV9kNtUqZGWHXw6VW5Nb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life is pretty great too; I only needed to charge it once a week on average, and while it doesn't quite last as long as the 30 hours that Tribit claims, I got 24 hours of use between charges. Bluetooth connectivity is rock-solid as well, and I didn't see any issues connecting the speaker to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the StormBox Blast 2 does everything I need in a portable Bluetooth speaker. It easily gets loud enough to fill a decent-sized room, and the sound quality is great — I didn't have any issues in this regard. Combine that with IP67 water resistance and 180W sound, and it isn't hard to see why this is such a good party speaker.</p>

I have a half-dozen 60% keyboards that I switch between, and in the last two months, I used MonsGeek's Fun60 Ultra with either tablet.</p><p>MonsGeek is one of several dozen Chinese brands that make mechanical keyboards these days, and its products have a good design and decent value. What I like about the Fun60 Ultra is that it uses TMR switches that are easily configurable, and the small size means it is great to use anywhere. This 60% keyboard is a good value as well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MONSGEEK-Keyboard-Magnetic-Aluminum-Shine-Through/dp/B0DQWNJJ6X">coming in at $89 on Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.monsgeek.com/product/fun60-ultra/">$95 on the brand's site</a>. That gets you the multi-mode variant with Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity, and it's the one I'd recommend.</p>

<p>The Fun60 Ultra has a clean design, and it doesn't take up anywhere as much room as a full-sized keyboard. It has a 61-key configuration, and it pairs with Windows and macOS in addition to Android and iOS. The build quality is fantastic; it is one of the sturdiest sub-$100 keyboards I used, and the all-metal chassis gives it rugged durability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PEvPzEePUphAeA2Yuk9miQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PEvPzEePUphAeA2Yuk9miQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The aluminum construction is a clear differentiator, and what I also like is that MonsGeek went to the effort of providing shine-through legends on the keys. That's not the case with most keyboards I use — which only provide diffused lighting — and while it's a small thing, it makes a noticeable difference in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UUxMf52Z7K3PWfRDHWufgQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UUxMf52Z7K3PWfRDHWufgQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The keys are made out of PBT plastic and are of a good quality, and they make the keyboard enjoyable to use. I tend to switch out the default keys and add my own (I like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-the-lord-of-the-rings-mt3-elven-keycap-set">LOTR Elvish set</a>), but I didn't feel the need to do so in this instance, and that's mostly down to the shine-through legends.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="29d8STTSSg3hgc4AzTALhQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/29d8STTSSg3hgc4AzTALhQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and did I mention that the RGB lighting gets bright? You get a good range of visual effects out of the box, and you can easily customize the lighting based on your preferences. The Akko Glare switch that's used on the keyboard has a see-through housing that does a great job diffusing light.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hYiRw8HNQVJXZApjVQpueQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hYiRw8HNQVJXZApjVQpueQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thanks to four rubber feet at the bottom, the keyboard stays planted on a desk, and while it is on the heavier side (it weighs 2.24lb), it is easily portable. After two months of rigorous use, I don't see any issues with the build quality whatsoever, and the Fun60 Ultra is clearly built to last.</p>

<p>There's a lot to like when it comes to connectivity as well; I used the keyboard predominantly via Bluetooth, but also tested it with USB-C to connect to my Windows machine. Bluetooth connectivity is solid, and it stayed paired to my iPad Pro M4 without any problems. The 4000mAh built-in battery lasts long, and I only had to charge the keyboard once a week.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C6tKF9xyMznqUHHvc3QogQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C6tKF9xyMznqUHHvc3QogQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the keyboard has 8000Hz polling when used with USB-C, and this gives it a little extra versatility if you want a smaller-sized gaming keyboard that's portable. On that note, the keyboard has an Arm Cortex-M4 platform and TMR switches that unlock the Fun60 Ultra's defining characteristic: adjustable actuation point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fDv7zrhghaRTdha9pRUEiQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fDv7zrhghaRTdha9pRUEiQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like hall effect switches, TMR switches use a magnetic design, and they deliver better accuracy and granular customization of the actuation point. The Akko Glare linear switch has a 3.4mm travel and minimum 25gf actuation with a max of 48gf, and you can set the actuation point to as low as 0.01mm, delivering instantaneous key presses.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ME7FFzsDkFRA8sHetPLLjQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ME7FFzsDkFRA8sHetPLLjQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This makes a sizeable difference, and having used several hall effect keyboards over the course of the last year, I'm glad to note that the Fun60 Ultra is among the best in the budget category. The switch doesn't have any wobble whatsoever, and the tray-mounted design makes it highly stable. In short, it has been a delight to use — both for gaming as well as day-to-day writing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P3ZuX7X7QoJFg388rToddQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P3ZuX7X7QoJFg388rToddQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another unique addition is the ability to add regular 5-pin switches; most hall effect boards only have the provision to slot in magnetic switches, but with the Fun60 Ultra, you can mix magnetic switches with regular mechanical ones, and that's great to see. You'll need to use MonsGeek's software to change the actuation point, and while it has its share of quirks, it gives you extensive customizability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vxHqmdNT4Ra7BHjFBkYJmQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vxHqmdNT4Ra7BHjFBkYJmQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, I didn't think I would use the Fun60 Ultra as much as I did; the rock-solid design combined with the TMR switch makes it a great budget keyboard, and the added customizability and vibrant RGB lighting allow it to stand out. The best part is the value; this is easily one of the best sub-$100 mechanical keyboards you can buy in 2025.</p>

My charging station has several Acefast USB-C cables, and I use these because they come with an integrated power meter, giving me a real-time indication of how fast connected devices are charging.</p>

<p>In the last six months, I relied on Rolling Square's inCharge XS as my go-to cable while on the go; the cable is just six inches long, and it has magnets at either end, allowing you to secure it to a lanyard, keyring, or your bag. It is on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Rolling-Square-inCharge-Universal-Eco-Friendly/dp/B0DQQ8SD9P">costlier side at $29</a>, but the cable has several unique features that justify the asking price.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="a5Dq9LzsvbJSuHbcvoZUen" name="rolling-square-incharge-xs-4" alt="Rolling Square inCharge XS keyring cable review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a5Dq9LzsvbJSuHbcvoZUen.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The inCharge XS is built to last; it uses a nylon-reinforced outer layer that's backed by a TPU cable guard, and there's a protective cap that secures both ends. It's clear that a lot of thought went into the design, and the cable is as portable as it is rugged. The cable is available in grey, beige, and orange, and having used all three colors, I prefer the orange variant — it just looks that much more vibrant.</p>

<p>The defining trait of the inCharge XS is the connectors; you get a USB-A and Lightning connector at either end, and the metal housing hides dual USB-C ports. Basically, you get a versatile set of ports that can be used to connect to any device; I used it as a USB-C to Lightning cable, USB-C to USB-C, USB-C to USB-A, and didn't see any problems whatsoever.</p>

<p>What I like is its charging potential; the inCharge XS goes up to 240W when using it in the USB-C to USB-C configuration, and it is the ideal cable to pair with UGREEN's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-25000mah-power-bank-review">Nexode 25000mAh Power Bank</a>.

<p>I didn't see any issues connecting my Seagate external SSD to my phone, and while the bandwidth is limited to to 480Mbit/s, it's usable. Basically, the inCharge XS does a great job as a daily-use cable; it attaches to a keyring securely, you get all the connectors you need, and there's fast charging and reliable data transfers.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Pixel owners have started voicing extreme displeasure with the company's seemingly overactive image processing software.</p><p>A thread on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1khba18/photo_processing_to_death/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Google Pixel subreddit</a> is full of users reporting odd, incorrect experiences with the phone and the processing software (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-image-processing-ruining-shots-3555627/">Android Authority</a>). The OP (original poster) called attention to the processing applied to photos taken on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. The user gives an example, using a photo of their Ford Mustang Shelby. The post shows two instances: Google's processing (left) and the correct image (right, what the viewfinder shows).</p><p>The car actually has quite a vibrant orange tone; however, Google's software seems to overdo its job, turning it into a much richer red. There are other aspects of the photo that are seemingly given a little too much saturation/richness, as opposed to what it looks like in reality.</p><p>The OP states they've experienced similar issues with the Pixel Tablet, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:723px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.99%;"><img id="Rqx5QAuAMn5a8ZSiERo8HG" name="google-pixel-9-pro-busy-processing-example" alt="A Reddit user's photo of their orange Ford Mustang Shelby (orange) and the effects of Google's processing, turning it to an incorrect red hue." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rqx5QAuAMn5a8ZSiERo8HG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="723" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1khba18/comment/mr66t4d/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user chimed in</a>, stating they're having problems with Google's photo process, too. According to their post, after attempting to snap a sunset photo, their device washed out the red hues of the sky, turning things more "yellow/orange." One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1khba18/comment/mr7cnx6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">other post calls out</a> the oversaturated/boost in contrast that Google's processing delivers, which isn't ideal for some users.</p><p>The user, like the OP, states there's no way to "turn everything off" to receive a photo void of Google's post-processing touch-ups. The original poster also states that disabling Ultra HDR and "rich color in photos" doesn't help. One thing that alleviates this issue is enabling "Top Shot." But the user adds that you must do this for every photo, as there's no why to keep this on permanently or disable Google's processing.</p>
<h2 id="another-look-through-the-lens-2">Another look through the Lens</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, this is an issue users are struggling with, and this will likely continue until (if) Google offers a more stable solution. The OP adds they were able to get a mostly true-to-life photo from a Pixel, but they had to dip back to their old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-3-review">Pixel 3</a>.</p><p>Google's had a history of fixing and updating its Pixel camera, with its last fixes rolling in with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">April security patch</a>. The patch was light, offering a fix for "camera stability" for the Pixel 6 and 7 series "under certain conditions." Another fix was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-march-2025-security-patch-rolls-out">entered in March</a>, but Google's processing wasn't mentioned in any of its patch notes.</p><p>As the publication notes, Google could rectify this issue by showing users outright what their photo will look like in the viewfinder, instead of surprising them after. Another option could be for the company to deliver more complete control over their final image.</p><p>While we await something further, Google rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-may-2025-pixel-update-is-here">May 2025 security patch</a> earlier this week. Among the fixes was a solution to a serious, critical zero-day exploit, meaning Pixel users should update as soon as possible.</p>

<hr>
<p>The CSA (Connectivity Standards Alliance) is releasing a small upgrade to v1.4 that should impact user setups in a big way.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/a-smarter-start-matter-1-4-1-makes-setup-easier/">its press release</a>, the CSA is detailing a "minor release" to its v1.4 upgrade that should refine and quicken the setup process for Matter-support devices. The CSA says these updates are "critical" to improving the setup experience users have when opening new smart home devices. This process sees Matter stepping up its support for QR codes by introducing "Multi-Device Setup QR Codes."</p><p>Many smart home users will know that some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter-supported</a> devices feature a QR code, so you can quickly scan and begin their setup process. However, the CSA states users are restricted to scanning codes one at a time and, at times, not knowing which QR code is the correct one.</p><p>Matter's Multi-Device QR code support makes it so users only need to scan one code "to set up multiple devices at once." This functionality will work so long as the devices in question feature "compatible commissioners."</p><p>Alternatively, Matter highlighted its new Onboarding Info in NFC tags. The CSA states this feature was designed to help users commission a device that's typically in an awkward spot once in place, like lightbulbs. With NFC, all users need to do is tap their device against the product. The device's onboarding information will be transferred to your phone to finalize its incorporation into your smart home.</p>
<h2 id="changes-that-matter-for-all-2">Changes that Matter for All</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wjB7hUWFYfXdLnpvAWTvwP" name="google-home-matter-light-update.jpg" alt="Using the Google Home app on a Google Pixel 8 Pro to turn on a smart light" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wjB7hUWFYfXdLnpvAWTvwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On a more technical level, the CSA is implementing an update to the core commissioning process via its Enhanced Setup Flow. The post states that this will support the "display of a manufacturer’s terms and conditions (T&Cs) directly in the commissioner app." Consumer consent for data will also be present. This change will affect device creators and the end user at home.</p><p>For creators, the CSA states they're now able to display their terms and conditions in apps beyond their own. For us at home, the change cuts one step out of the equation as we won't be tossed into multiple apps just for the sake of a device's terms and conditions.</p><p>The CSA's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-4-upgrade-more-device-support-roll-out">major Matter update</a>, v1.4, arrived in November with a focus on devices that'll help keep us warm in the bitter winter. The update included support for water heaters and heat pumps. Solar-powered products were also welcomed, alongside a few types of smart home batteries. The update also brought in support for thermostat scheduling and "preset modes."</p><p>With Matter 1.4, users could place their smart thermostat in "home/away and vacation" modes, depending on their situation. Matter's support includes thermostat triggering support for motion, calendar events, and more.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (May 8), Spotify detailed three new ways it's looking to improve the music discovery experience for its listeners in its app.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-07/experience-a-new-dimension-of-music-discovery-with-more-controls-and-enhanced-tools/">blog post</a>, Spotify highlighted the rollout of a few updates and a new test that users can expect. The platform says these updates are designed to place users "in the driver's seat" regarding their preferred listening and music discovery. Beginning with Premium subscribers, Spotify says the "Queue" is receiving an upgrade.</p><p>The post states your Queue is grabbing a visual refresh that places options like Shuffle, Smart Shuffle, Repeat, and Sleep Timer in easier-to-reach spots. Premium users are also said to see the tracks Spotify recommends in their Queue after the songs they've personally queued up are done.</p><p>Of course, Spotify's recommendations will appear if you've enabled Smart Shuffle or Autoplay. The platform says users can easily turn these off in their settings.</p><p>The test for Premium subscribers continues with an updated Hide button and a new Snooze button. The former will now hide a song on a playlist across <em>all </em>of your synced devices. The new Snooze button will give users a "temporary" break from a specific song, which lasts for 30 days.</p><p>All of these features are reportedly slowly arriving for Premium subscribers; however, there are plans to extend access to more people.</p>
<h2 id="playlist-customization-collabs-2">Playlist Customization & Collabs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1294px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="zujMii8FE4AEQpb79BMpan" name="spotify-mobile-app-playlists-menu-hero" alt="Multiple instances of the Spotify app on phones, showcasing its "Create" menu and playlists." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zujMii8FE4AEQpb79BMpan.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1294" height="728" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other side of these updates include better playlist customization options. These particularly concern mobile users, with Spotify preparing to rollout new "management tools." Mobile app users will soon find Add, Sort, and Edit buttons at the top of all of their playlists.</p><p>What's more, users who typically toss their tunes into their "Liked Songs" will find the ability to build a playlist out of its contents. Spotify says there will be an option to filter music by genre and a "turn into playlist" button. This feature in Liked Songs is rolling out for users in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the U.K., and the U.S.</p><p>Another Spotify app feature arriving is the Create Button, marked with a plus icon at the bottom-right of your phone. Spotify is placing features like playlist creation, collaborate with friends, and "join a Blend" within it. Premium users in "supported markets" go a step further by receiving access to Spotify's Jam and AI Playlists in the Create button.</p><p>Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists">AI Playlists hit the app in testing last year</a>, giving users the ability to craft a playlist out of their words. The platform offers some pre-made suggestions to get users started if they don't know where to begin. Spotify encourages users to get creative with their ideas and see what the AI generator thinks up. The blog post reiterates AI Playlists' expansion to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-04-24/spotify-expands-ai-playlist-in-beta-to-premium-listeners-in-40-new-markets/">40 additional markets</a> a month ago, bringing more listeners into the fold.</p>

<p>Sign up for Samsung's Galaxy Reserve program before May 12th and you'll receive a $50 credit to use towards (probably) the Galaxy S25 Edge when it's announced. Simply add your name and email address to the form and the discount is as good as yours. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="df3573e5-4b08-468a-8e54-8240e7ac2b9b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced" data-dimension48="Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Samsung has shared offers like this in the past, and believe me, it&apos;s pretty much the closest you can get to free money in this day and age. For what it&apos;s worth, I typically sign up every time new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> are announced, and I never have to deal with irritating marketing emails as a result. Samsung just hits me up once when the preorder period starts, and then I decide whether or not I want to move forward with my purchase. That&apos;s it. It&apos;s pretty nice. </p>

<p>The device in question is the fourth addition to Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a>, set to appear alongside the top-rated Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra that were released in January. If all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/massive-galaxy-s25-edge-leak-reveals-too-much">leaks and rumors</a> are correct, the Galaxy S25 Edge will boast a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display and use the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the rest of the flagship lineup. You can also expect loads of AI features and seven years of software updates guaranteed.</p><p>The Edge is expected to sport a smaller battery than its counterparts, presumably to make room for the ultra-thin design that gives the phone its name. The S25 Edge is set to weigh just 163 grams and clock in at 5.85 millimeters of thickness.</p><p>We&apos;re sure to see some other deals when the phone is officially announced — trade-in opportunities, free gift cards, and so on — but if you want to guarantee yourself some savings today, the Galaxy Reserve program is an easy way to snag some free cash with very little hassle. You can thank me later.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for an affordable foldable Android phone, you might have your eye on a Motorola model in the popular Razr line. There are a few generations to choose from, and two models you might be considering are the new Motorola Razr 2025 and the Motorola Razr 2023.</p><p>On the one hand, the Motorola Razr 2025 is the newer, better, latest device. On the other hand, you might find the older Motorola Razr 2023 for a steal. Perhaps you already own the latter and you’re wondering if it’s worth the upgrade. Read on to find out in this Razr 2025 vs. Razr 2023 comparison.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-2025-vs-motorola-razr-2023-the-design-and-basic-features-2">Motorola Razr 2025 vs. Motorola Razr 2023: The design and basic features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6k29fZHeTa8PYDA4unZvFQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-3" alt="The Razr 2025 in different colors and finishes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6k29fZHeTa8PYDA4unZvFQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 is the entry-model in the latest line from the company, which also includes the higher-end Motorola Razr Ultra and Razr+. You’ll get a 6.9-inch AMOLED FHD+ 2,640 x 1,080 HDR10+ inner screen that boasts an ultra-bright 3,000 nits of peak brightness for comfortable viewing in any condition.</p><p>The external screen, meanwhile, is a 3.6-inch 1,056 x 1,066 pOLED screen with up to 90Hz refresh rate, HDR10, and a decent 1,700 nits peak brightness. Compared to the Motorola Razr 2023, the big difference here is in the size of the external screen. You can customize the external screen with various panels for the information that is most useful to you.</p><p>You can also adjust the phone in various positions, including Flex View, even holding it like a camcorder while recording videos. There’s also dual preview and the photo booth feature which make use of both the cameras and the foldable design.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 comes in new Pantone finishes, including Gibraltar Sea, Spring Bud, Lightest Sky, and Parfait Pink with leather-inspired, nylon-inspired, and, for the first time with a Motorola device in North America, lightweight Acetate finish. It’s equipped with a titanium-reinforced hinge that Motorola says is four times stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. It also boasts ultra-thin glass, made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus.</p><p>The phone has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">IP48 rating for dust and water resistance</a>, stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, and three microphones. It can be purchased with up to 256GB of storage. The phone will likely run all day, leveraging the 4,500mAh battery that supports 30W TurboPower charging to get an extra day after just a 15-minute charge. It also supports 15W wireless charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="fXTHrsCDX5KzynkbG2UGgT" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-14.jpg" alt="The Razr 2023 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fXTHrsCDX5KzynkbG2UGgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3999" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Motorola Razr 2023 comes with a vegan leather finish on the back complemented by a brushed metal finish that Android Central's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Derrek Lee says in his review</a> feels and looks “classy.” Available in Sage Green, Vanilla Cream, Summer Lilac, or Cherry Blossom finishes, the inner screen is the same 6.9-inch size, a pOLED with the same 2,640 x 1,080 resolution, up to 144Hz refresh rate, and HDR10+, but it’s less bright at just 1,400 nits, though Lee still calls it “punchy and bright.”</p><p>The biggest difference when it comes to appearance lies with the external display, which, in this phone, is just 1.5 inches in size. The tiny, rectangular OLED with 194 x 368 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, and up to 1,000 nits brightness more resembles the screen of a smartwatch or a fitness tracker built into the outside of the phone. It’s effectively a small black bar that shows limited details. It’s a simple design meant mostly for glanceable information, but it might be appreciated by some to limit distractions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HhP7MdUAanqZRCEpx9bqha" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-13.jpg" alt="A clock face on the Razr 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HhP7MdUAanqZRCEpx9bqha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lee notes that customization is limited to panels for things like weather, calendar, contracts, media, a timer, and an audio recorder. Swipe among them using a carousel, swipe down to access Quick Settings, or swipe up to see notifications.</p><p>While you can do simple things like delete an email from the external screen, for most interactions, you will need to open the phone. You can, it should be noted, take photos and preview the shot from the external screen as well. However, it’s challenging to take and orient them using the external screen, and you’re limited in the modes you use.</p><p>The phone has a sturdy hinge that Lee says leaves a minimal crease and feels even sturdier than the one on the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 model. The screen is covered in Gorilla Glass Victus for additional durability. It meets a higher IP52 rating for dust, but that’s less for water. So, this phone is more durable against larger objects but less able to withstand water sprays.</p><p>Oddly, it only comes with 128GB non-expandable storage, so you’ll need a cloud service if you plan to take tons of photos and videos, download apps, and more. You’ll likely run out of room fairly quickly if you’re a digital packrat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfBHpEDKGkAcMfetHV7WBY" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-8.jpg" alt="Notifications on the Razr 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfBHpEDKGkAcMfetHV7WBY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery-wise, you get a decent 4,200mAh battery with the Motorola Razr 2023, which Lee says doesn’t quite last a full day, but will get you through most of one before you need to recharge. It also supports 30W wired charging, but you’ll only be able to charge at a 5W snail’s pace with wireless chargers. It’s almost not even worth it unless you keep the phone atop a wireless charger on your desk all day.</p><p>This phone also has stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos and Spatial Sound along with three microphones. With both, you get the usuals like a fingerprint sensor, face unlock, Bluetooth 5.3, 5G connectivity, NFC, and more.</p><p>One important detail worth noting is that with both phones, Motorola promises three years of Android updates and four years of security updates. Since the Motorola Razr 2023 was introduced in North America back in October 2023, you already need to shave more than a year off that count.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 focuses heavily on an AI experience, as most of the latest phones do today. It comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and, as mentioned, three years of software and four years of security updates. That’s behind others like Google and Samsung, which also make foldable phones. But it’s still pretty decent, getting you through to Android 18.</p><p>Running on an upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400x</a> processor, which affords boosted AI performance, it’s the only phone in the new line that doesn’t run on a Snapdragon processor. However, Derrek Lee says in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">his initial hands-on of the Motorola Razr 2025</a> that he didn’t have any performance issues using previous generation Razr phones running on the older version of this processor, so he suspects the same will be the case with this phone.</p><p>You’ll get 8GB RAM and Google Gemini and Gemini Live alongside Moto AI.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, you can enjoy features like Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and Remember Thus. There’s also Next Move on the external display, which will recognize what’s on the screen and offer suggestions for your, well, next move. This could be creating a music playlist for you while you cook dinner using a recipe you found online, or making a new wallpaper image inspired by an upcoming vacation.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a> with AI features allows you to give text or voice commands to share content from your phone to the TV, or even do things like pull up notes on a PC, great for multitasking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3968px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6hjeFcH6peFiy4559RGSZb" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-10.jpg" alt="Moto Unplugged on the Razr 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6hjeFcH6peFiy4559RGSZb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3968" height="2232" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does the Motorola Razr 2023 compare? Since it was introduced a year and a half ago, it comes loaded with Android 13 and MyUX, which means you’ll only get up to Android 16 with this phone. That’s something to consider if you want a foldable you can hang onto for many years to come. The integration of MyUX adds some fun and useful customization features, though, like being able to twist the phone twice to activate the camera or chop twice to trigger the flashlight.</p><p>It runs on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a> processor that Lee says gets the job done and comes with the same 8GB RAM. “The phone is able to handle much of my daily tasks without faltering,” says Derrek. He also found that it performed well for gaming, though it gets warm if you play intense games at the highest setting.</p><p>The big omission here is that you don’t get any AI experiences, beyond being able to access limited Google Gemini and Google Photos features. It’s overall a fairly basic phone that even has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-razr-plus-update-brings-moto-unplugged">Moto Unplugged</a> feature to help you disconnect when you need a digital detox break, effectively Motorola’s version of Focus Mode.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3725px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WpsdAUJDnMcVNvncKRwDfU" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-1.jpg" alt="The Razr 2023 on a pile of leaves" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpsdAUJDnMcVNvncKRwDfU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3725" height="2095" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the cameras. The Motorola Razr 2025 has a 50MP main rear camera, a 13MP ultrawide camera with macro vision, and a 32MP front camera. You should theoretically get better photos with the AI-powered photo enhancement engine. We can’t speak to that until we’ve had more time with the phone. Stay tuned.</p><p>By comparison, the Motorola Razr 2023 has a larger sensor, a 64MP rear main camera, a 13MP ultra-wide camera with macro vision, and a 32MP front “selfie” camera.</p><p>Derrek says the phone takes decent photos, but they often leave him wanting more. It lacks in areas like contrast, white balance, color balance, or simple punch, but does take fairly good night shots. The results with photos are also inconsistent. Basically, the camera experience is not a selling point for this phone.</p><p>Enjoy all the usual features you’ll find in Motorola phones for capturing the best shots, like burst shot, auto smile, portrait, night vision, quick capture, and more. There are also features like gesture capture with the front camera and face beauty. But you’ll have to choose and store your photos wisely since there’s only a 128GB option.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-2025-vs-motorola-razr-2023-which-should-you-choose-2">Motorola Razr 2025 vs. Motorola Razr 2023: Which should you choose?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Denu4EfRCdzoo6borEdDZQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-2" alt="Three Razr 2025 phones stacked on top of each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Denu4EfRCdzoo6borEdDZQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It stands to reason that when considering the Motorola Razr 2025 vs. Motorola Razr 2023, the newer phone of the two is better. The Motorola Razr 2025 employs a better design, mostly better specs, and AI experiences that have become important nowadays for everything from convenience to assistance and even taking photos and videos.</p><p>With that said, it’s not a massive step-up from the Motorola Razr 2023, and still only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-vs-razr-2024">an iterative update from the Motorola Razr 2024</a>. So, if you invested a bunch in one of those older foldables already, it’s worth hanging onto for now, at least until the software support runs out. By then, Motorola will likely have an even better foldable to consider. If you really want to upgrade now, you’d be better off saving up to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, which is a bigger jump in features and will better justify the switch.</p><p>If you’re buying new and you find the Motorola Razr 2023 for cheap, amortize that cost over the number of years of use it has left when it comes to software and security support. It might sound like a good deal now, but it might not be in the long run. If you just want something for now, however, and plan to upgrade in two years anyway, go for it. Or, as noted, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> instead, which ranks among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a> as the best budget option you can buy right now.</p>

<p>One important thing to note between the Motorola Razr 2025 and Razr 2023 is the difference in the external screen. The Motorola Razr 2023’s external screen is mostly for glancing at notifications, like a news strip across the bottom. “This cover screen,” Derrek explains, “is meant to give you the bare minimum while still serving its purpose of letting you decide whether or not it’s worth it to open your phone. It’s a shame Motorola couldn’t put a larger display on the outside.”</p><p>If you want something more robust with a much larger external screen, you’ll find value in the Motorola Razr 2025’s larger external screen. But you might also appreciate fewer distractions with the smaller screen of the Motorola Razr 2023. In this respect, it comes down to personal preference.</p>

The most visible difference is the larger external screen on which you can do more. If you're looking for a more traditionally designed foldable on a budget, this is it.</p></p>

With the... erm... messy launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, it might be tempting to jump on board and give it a spin. Don't.</p><p>The idea of wrecking a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> with unfinished buggy software is insane to me.

<p>No, I'm not talking trash about Samsung. Not at all. I think Samsung makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">finest phones money can buy</a>, and if one of the premium models fits into your budget you're going to be pleased with it. That goes for both the hardware and the software. It took a while to get here, but Samsung has shown how a company can use Android to make its products better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">the "original" straight from Google</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-alleged-early-preview-report">One UI 8</a> will continue this trend. The company will change what needs to be changed in a way that seems meaningful, with the purpose of adding value to its products. A lot of people will agree and love it. But not until it's ready. We've seen time and time again what happens when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-launch-messy">release software that's not ready</a>; it's ugly and something you should never expect to happen on a very pricey phone.</p>

<p>When the One UI 8 beta <em>does</em> launch, people will be rushing to find a way to try it, and plenty of those folks will wish they hadn't. Don't take my word for it, just look at any internet community to see people getting more trouble than they bargained for with an experimental software build. The earliest builds aren't for you anyway, unless you're a developer looking to test how potential changes affect your product.</p><p>Samsung is going to show us something from One UI 8 that we really want to try, probably when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">announces the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7</a> or maybe even as a surprise at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O</a>. That doesn't mean it's ready for us just yet. Give it time to cook, and it will taste a lot better.</p>

<p>Google Maps for iOS is getting quite an interesting feature that lets you save locations from screenshots.</p><p>Imagine you are that kind of person who often checks for new places either on the web or on social media — like a reel that shows some beautiful location. While you immediately screenshot it, Google Maps can now make a list of such screenshots in the app and help you save that location with the help of Gemini.</p>
<p>It is supposedly a new functionality, which is rolling out to Google Maps for iOS devices (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/07/google-maps-screenshots-iphone/">9to5Google</a>). Previously, users who saved the aforementioned screenshots would go into their phone's gallery to see the location and again open up the Maps location and check for the location to get an idea.</p><p>The new Maps feature, however, would save you from these steps and instead users would need to check for the 'You' tab in the Google Maps app wherein users will see a new Screenshots list with a badge indicating "Try it out."</p>

<h2 id="using-the-new-screenshots-feature-on-google-maps-2">Using the new Screenshots feature on Google Maps</h2>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/how-to-google-maps-screenshot-save-gemini/">shares a how-to post</a> explaining how to use the feature. Tapping "Try it out" will open up a video showcasing how the feature works, and users can simultaneously check the feature as well.</p><p>Firstly, users will have to allow Google Maps to access their photos, following which whenever a user takes a screenshot of the location info, they can directly head to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a> app wherein it recognizes a place and "a message will pop up telling you that it has places ready for you to review."</p><p>Users can then tap "review" if they want to save the image to their screenshots list or not, which is found on the "You" section of the Google Maps app. Consumers can also add older screenshots to the same list if they want to.</p>

<p>With the help of Gemini, users will be able to see the saved directly on their Google Maps or can look from the aforementioned list whenever required.</p><p>As 9to5 notes, the feature is currently rolling out to iOS devices, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android handsets</a> are likely to get it soon. Google previously highlighted this feature earlier this year in March, as part of its AI updates to get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-flights-traveling-trends-updates">users ready for the summer</a>. There were other updates mentioned, as well, like the ability for users to receive "trip ideas" for distinct regions and places in AI Overviews.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing fans have been wondering about the next major flagship phone launch, and that appears to be on the horizon.</p><p>The company recently dropped a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1920137994893230380">emoji teasers on X</a> that could indicate the impending launch of a long-awaited device. The first teaser involves a smartphone emoji, while the second one, posted earlier today (May 8), is an emoji for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1920478376378179611">the number three</a>. The teasers have left users on X curious for more, as these are the first real teasers concerning the Phone 3.</p><p>Nothing hasn't expanded its teasers just yet, and its CEO, Carl Pei, has been awfully quiet about the Phone 3 emoji posts, as well.</p><p>The company's next flagship has been a long time coming, especially after being delayed for features we've seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and 3a Pro</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pushed-aside-for-the-sake-of-ai-2">Pushed aside for the sake of AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro with LED lights enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of the current user excitement stems from Nothing's cancellation of the Phone 3 launch last year, for the sake of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">furthering its AI ambitions</a>. In an X update, Carl Pei detailed Nothing's new plans to focus more on AI, as it "prototyped AI interactions." Pei also stated that the company was working on redefining how users utilize their smartphones. Additionally, Pei said, "The current user experience hasn't evolved for more than a decade."</p><p>Nothing's AI (at the time) was touted as a piece of software that would be "highly personalized and dynamic" with a "cross-device interface."</p><p>It was speculated that the company's AI ambitions were more on-device focused, thus forcing it to make a decision: rush a Phone 3 launch in 2024 or wait. It chose the latter.</p><p>We've since seen Nothing's on-device AI come to life in the Phone 3a and 3a Pro, which brought its new physical button, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">the Essential Key</a>, for its Essential Space suite of features. This hub lets users organize and rediscover screenshots, quickly capture voice notes, and much more.</p>
<h2 id="a-rapid-focus-on-the-phone-3-2">A "Rapid Focus" on the Phone 3</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3⃣<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1920478376378179611">May 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>After Nothing confirmed the Phone 3a series in January, its co-founder, Akis Evangelidis, stated the Phone 3 is still on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">tap for a 2025 debut</a>. Evangelidis added that the device would be a "milestone" for the company with a "rapid focus" right after the 3a series rolled out to consumers. With that in mind, Carl Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-ceo-carl-pei-reassures-fans-phone-3-is-definitely-coming-to-the-u-s">recently reassured fans</a> on social media that the Phone 3 is coming to the U.S., "100%!"</p><p>Now, one week later, we're seeing emoji teasers, potentially indicating its launch is within reach.</p><p>Rumors about the device have been sparse; however, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-database-listing-chip-details-leak">database listing</a> late last year suggested it could launch with a 6.5-inch OLED display. Curiously, the phone's SoC of choice is still up in the air. Some rumors claim it could drop with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, but this chip debuted on the 3a and 3a Pro. Other rumors claim we could see the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.</p><p>Much of this speculation is on the back of Nothing's ambitions to develop AI, which both chips can help with. For now, with such confusion in the rumors, it's best to wait for Nothing's official say-so, especially since we're seeing a few teasers.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-not-too-difficult-to-find-the-right-razr-plus-2025-case-for-your-needs-2">It's not too difficult to find the right Razr Plus 2025 case for your needs</h2>
<p>Good news! The best Motorola Razr Plus 2025 cases include some of the most popular Razr Plus 2024 cases. That's why so many of these options are a lot cheaper than they feel like they should be. Even if your budget is as constrained as $10, you can get a nice case for your shiny new foldable.</p><p>I adore the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">sensory experience of the Razr Plus 2025</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">its siblings</a> present. Hiding that stunning design behind a gaudy phone cover isn't something you'd want to do. However, it's also true that a cracked phone is worse than a clunky phone in a case. A good compromise between the two is to get a clear case.</p><p>When it comes to good clear cases for your Razr Plus 2025, I highly recommend getting one with a Qi2 or MagSafe ring. This makes your Razr even more functional and you can then use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">magnetic accessories for Android</a> with it, like car chargers, holders, etc. The Fin2feel Magnetic Razr Plus 2024/2025 Case is roughly $16 and it delivers exactly that premise, which is why it's my top pick.</p><p>Alternatively, you could take a more extreme route to protect your Motorola Razr Plus 2025 from calamities of all nature. This would need a rugged case like the Poetic Spartan or the Vizvera Case with Hinge Cover. Both come with built-in screen protectors, but Poetic has a more established name in the industry and makes higher-quality accessories. If you're not sold on that nearly $40 price tag though, then the Vizvera should suffice.</p>

<h2 id="motorola-razr-2025-line-up-big-batteries-with-quick-charging-support-2">Motorola Razr 2025 line-up: Big batteries with quick charging support</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, Motorola has carved out quite a reputation for itself as one of the key players in the world of foldable phones. And with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025 series</a>, the brand looks poised to solidify that position even further.</p><p>To that end, Motorola is giving prospective consumers more choice than before. If you are thinking about getting a new flip-style phone from Motorola, you can pick from the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr 2025, Razr Plus 2025, and Razr Ultra 2025</a>. The trio has numerous design improvements like a more durable titanium hinge, IP48 certification for better dust and water resistance, and a range of funky colors to pick from.</p><p>All three members of the Razr 2025 family also get upgraded internals. The top-tier Razr 2025 Ultra deserves a special mention here since it can compete with some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> available.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6k29fZHeTa8PYDA4unZvFQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-3" alt="The Razr 2025 in different colors and finishes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6k29fZHeTa8PYDA4unZvFQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, all this hardware needs power, which is why Motorola's latest foldables pack in larger batteries with faster charging (in both wired and wireless modes) capabilities.</p><p>The base Razr 2025 comes with a 4,500mAh battery that supports 30W wired and 15W wireless charging. Then there's the Razr Plus 2025, which has a 4,000mAh battery with 45W wired and 15W wireless charging support. You also get 5W reverse charging that can be used to juice up smaller devices such as wireless earbuds. Lastly, the Razr Ultra 2025 features a 4,700mAh battery with support for 68W and 30W wireless charging. It includes 5W reverse charging as well.</p><p>While these charging speeds are great, it's important to know that you need the right wall charger for them. Since none of the latest Razr foldables comes bundled with one (as is the case with most smartphones these days), you can get one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C fast chargers</a> for the best experience.</p><p>Considering that the previous-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> managed to impress Android Central managing editor Derrek Lee with their battery life, we have little doubt that Motorola's latest foldables will also exceed our expectations.</p>

Mojang originally launched VR support for Minecraft Bedrock on the Samsung Gear VR back in April 2016, porting the experience over to the PC version that August. PSVR support was added in 2020, but things went downhill from there.</p>

<p>While there was a way to play the old Gear VR version on the Oculus Go and the original Oculus Quest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-does-not-support-oculus-go-games">the Oculus Quest 2 ended support</a> for these older games, making it impossible to play. As Mojang slowly pulled the plug on Minecraft VR as an officially supported concept, modders took up the mantle the company failed to uphold.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vivecraft.org/">Vivecraft</a> is by far the most successful Minecraft VR mod. It adds VR support to Minecraft Java, including made-for-VR mechanics that Mojang never bothered to add to the Bedrock version. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sidequestvr.com/app/7150/questcraft" target="_blank">QuestCraft</a>, a port of Vivecraft made to run natively on Meta Quest headsets, debuted in February 2022 and was a gem until the v71 Meta Quest update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/QuestCraft/issues/639">broke the game</a> in December 2024.</p><p>The only official reason Mojang has given for ending VR support is a cop-out, at best. "Our ability to support VR/MR devices has come to an end," says Mojang's Jay Wells in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-40-bedrock-changelog">October 2024 update changelog</a>, making it sound like Mojang doesn't have enough funds or resources to get the job done. But nothing could be further from the truth, and the rest of the politics of Meta and Microsoft's recent work further muddle an already confounding decision.</p>

<p>Since Microsoft seems allergic to giving official player counts for anything these days, I have to estimate things based on other factors. We know that Minecraft sold more than 300 million copies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/minecraft/minecraft-crosses-300-million-copies-sold-as-it-prepares-to-celebrate-its-15th-anniversary">as of October 2023</a>, and statistics firms like DemandSage estimate that Minecraft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.demandsage.com/minecraft-statistics/">sees over 55 million </a><em>daily active players</em>. Only games like Fortnite can match those numbers, again <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/fortnite-stats">according to statistics groups</a>.</p><p>Mojang employs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/mojang-studios-feels-like-underfunded-indie-studio">over 600 people</a>, and recent successes like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/a-minecraft-movie-continues-to-print-money-and-fans-can-now-go-to-special-screenings-and-be-as-loud-as-they-please">the Minecraft Movie</a> further add to the hundreds of millions of dollars Minecraft makes for Microsoft every year.</p><p>So, how in the world can a studio that's this massive, with this much funding and annual revenue, confidently proclaim that its "ability to support VR/MR devices has come to an end?" None of it makes any sense, and no one seems to know why.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>QuestCraft, the only native Quest port of Minecraft, is run by four individuals in their spare time. Surely Mojang could match this effort.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The best answer I could gather is that the number of VR players would be "a drop in the bucket" compared to the number of Minecraft players worldwide. That may be true, but it wouldn't take very many staff members to properly support a Minecraft VR on the world's most popular VR platform, Meta Quest. QuestCraft, the only native Quest port of Minecraft, is run by four individuals in their spare time. Surely Mojang could match this effort.</p><p>The Meta Quest's demographics have been shifting younger and younger over the years, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">free-to-play content ruling the roost</a> for revenue and player count on the platform every month. Unironically, this exact demographic is the one that would put the most time into Minecraft if it were officially launched as a Meta Quest game.</p><p>Back in 2020, then Oculus CTO John Carmack famously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/minecraft-oculus-quest-carmack/">got Minecraft running on the Quest</a> "with full positional tracking," something Mojang already had working just fine on the PC side of things. For some untold reason, this version of the game was never officially picked up by Mojang.</p>

<p>All of this becomes more confusing when you consider Meta and Microsoft's other VR partnerships over the past year. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xbox-game-pass-meta-quest-launch">play Xbox Game Pass games on Quest</a>, Windows 11 has an official linking app so you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-11-vr-integration-meta-quest-announcement">can use your PC on a Quest</a>, and even Microsoft Office <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/microsoft-office-is-finally-available-on-meta-quest-headsets">has official Meta Quest apps</a>. Oh, and don't forget that we're still due for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Xbox-branded Meta Quest headset</a> that was announced last April.</p><p>Meta claims to have attempted to work with Microsoft on getting an official port even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/boztank/status/1827380465390755984">as recently as August 2024</a>, but, strangely, hasn't seemed to be able to make any progress.</p><p>If I were being overly optimistic, I'd say that Mojang killed the PC VR version of Minecraft Bedrock in favor of launching a native Quest version later this year. I'd probably lose money if I bet on that, but there's a very real expectation that these third-party Meta Horizon OS-powered headsets should be launching later this year to compete with the official release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, and this would tie in perfectly with those announcements.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Everyone loses when Mojang decides that Minecraft players don't want VR support, and it's ridiculous that Microsoft and Mojang don't see that.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>No matter the reason, Mojang is leaving money on the table by not supporting a native Meta Quest Minecraft VR. The official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.com/invite/questcraft">QuestCraft Discord server</a> has 80,000 users with dozens of new ones joining every day. That's for a mod of a game that requires you to sign up for a developer account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-apps-oculus-quest">and then sideload it</a> onto your Quest just to play. Oh, plus, you need to own Minecraft Java, not Bedrock, for it to work.</p><p>Imagine, then, how many more players would be on Minecraft VR if there were an official Bedrock version of the game? It's not hard to expect that number to be in the hundreds of thousands or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1hioq4m/animal_company_has_cross_1_million_active_players/">over a million active players</a>, as the most popular Quest games have.</p><p>That's players buying stuff on the Marketplace, people subscribing to Realms so they can more easily play with friends on their own time, and players making even more content for their YouTube channels. Everyone loses when Mojang decides that Minecraft players don't want VR support, and it's ridiculous that Microsoft and Mojang don't see that.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung might make a One UI 8 beta program available based on Android 16 this month, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-one-ui-8-beta-should-start-this-month/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>. The publication says that it hears the One UI 8 beta will kick off in the third week of May 2025, which is less than two weeks away. In terms of availability, it's expected the One UI 8 beta will be extremely limited to certain devices and regions initially, with expanded access in June 2025.</p><p>The move comes following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/someone-with-a-galaxy-s25-ended-up-getting-an-alleged-one-ui-8-update">Samsung's internal testing of One UI 8</a>. A version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>-based upgrade appeared on test servers earlier today, May 8, which is a sign that the South Korean company is preparing for a public beta.</p><p>The update, with build version <strong>S938BXXU3ZYEA/S938BOXM3ZYEA/S938BXXU3BYEA</strong>, was spotted on a test server for the Samsung Galaxy S25 by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1920374301066207715" target="_blank">Tarun Vats on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, One UI 7 beta builds started appearing on test servers a few weeks before they became available to the public. This is the first time a One UI 8 beta build has appeared on a Samsung test server, and it's a key indicator that the beta program could start very soon.</p>

<p>The emergence of an early One UI 8 beta program might come as a surprise considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-launch-messy">the struggles Samsung experienced delivering One UI 7</a>, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. That update was a multi-year overhaul that brought many challenges, whereas One UI 8 is expected to be a smaller and more manageable update. Paired with Google moving up its Android release schedule, this all helps explain why One UI 8 appears to be progressing quicker than expected.</p><p>Separately, it's rumored that Samsung will launch its new foldables — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> — with One UI 8 out of the box.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-72">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 might break records as the world’s thinnest foldable, measuring just 3.9mm open and 8.9mm folded.</li><li>Samsung is focusing on thinner, lighter designs for its flagship devices, with the Z Fold 7 sticking to the same 4,400mAh battery as its predecessor.</li><li>The Z Flip 7 could also get a battery bump to 4,300mAh, up from 4,000mAh in the Z Flip 6.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor says Samsung's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> might just break records as the slimmest foldable phone ever made when it sees daylight.</p><p>According to reliable tipster @UniverseIce, Samsung is switching gears, focusing on making its flagship phones way thinner and lighter (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-7-worlds-thinnest-foldable-phone-report/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). Backing that up, the tipster claims the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-thinner-folded-profile-speculation-report">set to launch as the thinnest foldable out there</a>, measuring just 3.9mm when open and 8.9mm folded.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to some exclusive information, the next direction of Samsung flagship machine is still to be thin and light, and the battery will be thin and thin, and the body will continue to be thin. The Galaxy Z Fold7 will be the thinnest folding machine in the world at that time,… pic.twitter.com/uAs3NzAf8j<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1919997501807198212">May 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<h2 id="same-battery-new-tricks-2">Same battery, new tricks?</h2>
<p>Digging into the battery side of things, @UniverseIce backed up earlier leaks saying the Z Fold 7 will stick with the same 4,400mAh battery as the last model. The leak also teased some fresh battery tech and charging tricks under the hood for this one.</p><p>However, the battery might feel a bit underwhelming, especially next to the Oppo Find N5’s 5,600mAh cell. The Chinese phone maker pulled that off by using a high-density silicon-carbon mix in its battery, letting the company pack more juice into the same space.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="GtyCmJKLo7RwHmMt2AotPY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-closed-angled" alt="A leaked rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in its closed form, showcasing a slightly thinner form factor." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GtyCmJKLo7RwHmMt2AotPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="788" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery doubts aside, if the Z Fold 7 really is the thinnest foldable ever, that could be Samsung’s secret weapon to stand out in the crowded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> segment. With its recent slip in the foldable rankings, pulling off something this sleek might be just what it needs to turn heads again.</p><p>For context, the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> measures 12.2mm thick when folded and 5.6mm when open. Meanwhile, Oppo’s Find N5 holds the crown as the slimmest book-style foldable at just 8.93mm folded and 4.21mm unfolded. So if Samsung really manages to go even thinner with the Fold 7, it’s a major flex in foldable design.</p>
<h2 id="thinness-over-battery-2">Thinness over battery?</h2>
<p>If the latest rumors hold true, Samsung could soon snatch the crown for the world’s thinnest foldable from Oppo. That’s, of course, unless Oppo surprises us with a new, even slimmer Find N model before Samsung drops its Z Fold 7.</p><p>Switching gears to the Z Flip 7, the same insider hints at an upgraded 4,300mAh battery, up from the 4,000mAh in the Z Flip 6. Multiple sources have backed this up, making it look like a solid upgrade for the next-gen device.</p><p>Samsung’s move to focus on a thinner foldable, even if it means sacrificing some battery life, is a bold gamble.

<ul><li>Ultrahuman says its new "UltraFactory" facility in Texas will "soon scale its production" to 500,000 Ring Airs per year.</li><li>SVtronics, a U.S.-based electronics manufacturer, partnered with Ultrahuman last November to open the facility.</li><li>Oura recently disputed Ultrahuman's claims of a Texas-based facility in its ITC case against the company, as part of a patent dispute.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>India-based smart ring brand Ultrahuman has announced plans to produce 100% of its popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ring Air</a> devices for U.S. customers in its Texas "UltraFactory" by the end of 2025, showing no signs of slowing down despite its current legal hurdles.</p><p>While Ultrahuman says this facility currently produces 400 Ring Air units per day, the eventual goal is to "soon scale its production to more than half a million units annually" — or at least 1,370 per day — so that it no longer needs to import any smart rings from India.</p><p>"The UltraFactory in Plano, Texas, allows us to deliver products faster, enhance quality control, and further strengthen our commitment to American consumers to bring them cutting-edge health technology," says Ultrahuman CEO Mohit Kumar.</p><p>The press release goes on to say that domestic smart ring production will ensure "faster shipping, better service, and increased reliability." It would also help Ultrahuman avoid any tariffs on ring sales, while creating "hundreds of high-skilled jobs" in Plano.</p>

<p>Oura is trying to stop Ultrahuman and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> makers from selling or importing their products in the United States. This announcement shows that Ultrahuman will stick to business as usual, unless the International Trade Commission (ITC) forces the issue.</p><p>A recent U.S. ITC judge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-wins-major-us-trade-case-against-smart-ring-rivals">ruled against Ultrahuman</a> in favor of Oura over alleged patent infringements, though it was merely an initial determination. In that ruling, the judge disputed Ultrahuman's claims that it had a manufacturing facility in Texas, suggesting it had submitted slides with Photoshopped images of the Ultrahuman logo added to SVTronics facilities.</p><p>The judge called this a "concerning issue regarding Ultrahuman's credibility," and clearly, Ultrahuman hopes to refute this concern by publicly unveiling the UltraFactory as a real and productive facility.</p>

<p>In a blog post titled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.ultrahuman.com/blog/so-whats-the-patent-that-oura-is-suing-everyone-for/">"So what’s the patent that Oura is suing everyone for?"</a> Ultrahuman makes its case for why Oura's smart ring patent shouldn't apply to them, claiming it has a strong case to dispute the initial findings in post-review and that "70% of such proceedings result in invalidation of all challenged claims."</p><p>It then boasts about its Texas facilities as the "first-ever Smart ring manufacturing facility" in the United States and says it will "double down" on U.S. sales rather than preemptively accept the ruling.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-itc-case/">Oura's blog post</a> praises the patent system as a "cornerstone of American innovation" and its "talented team members based in the U.S.," while decrying the "dishonest tactics" of its "foreign competitors." Clearly, both smart ring brands see value in looking as "American" as possible as this legal battle proceeds.</p><p>Ultimately, the ITC filing notes that Oura and competing brands like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> have "the manufacturing capability to replace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn</a> and Ultrahuman's accused products if they are excluded from the U.S. market." But given this UltraFactory announcement, Ultrahuman has no plans to cede its U.S. smart ring business just yet.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It's easy enough to craft great-sounding IEMs in the mid-range and high-end categories; brands often work with quality materials and can take the time to tune these products to a greater extent. That's why I've always maintained that the budget segment is where you get the most amount of excitement — there isn't much in the way of margins, and audio makers have to know what they're doing to be able to deliver something that sounds good while still being affordable.</p><p>That's what Oriveti is aiming to do with the Blackbird; the Chinese brand partnered with India's leading audio store Headphone Zone over the Blackbird, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.headphonezone.in/products/headphone-zone-x-oriveti-blackbird">coming in at just ₹4,999</a> ($58), they're a downright bargain when you consider the sound quality. It's no wonder, then, that the Blackbird is the best-selling IEM on the site's budget category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8LVaZeJ48wY9ReDSffyc7k" name="oriveti-blackbird-8" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8LVaZeJ48wY9ReDSffyc7k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Blackbird is a custom collaboration, but it is based on the bleqk Lowmaster, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORIVETI-bleqk-LOWMASTER-Detachable-Ear/dp/B0DG5M5CPZ">costs $149 IEM on Amazon</a>. You get the same design but with a glossier shell and additional logos, and it has the same set of drivers and identical accessories. After using the IEMs, I'm convinced that they're a bargain.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="32nAWEUjBcQBczt6yeL3zj" name="oriveti-blackbird-7" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/32nAWEUjBcQBczt6yeL3zj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oriveti went with 3D printed shells that are comfortable to wear, and I didn't see any issues with fatigue even with extended use. They're light enough that you don't notice you're wearing IEMs, and the sound tube doesn't nozzle into the ear canal too much.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3uRPhiqoR5dELUnbSADQQk" name="oriveti-blackbird-5" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3uRPhiqoR5dELUnbSADQQk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the overt logo doesn't look as clean as the standard model, there are no problems with the fit, and the build quality is great. The IEMs have standard 2-pin connectors, and the bundled cable is of a decent quality; it has a 3.5mm plug, and the braided design is durable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="sv7T5ikNirQuWHBUMaGLCk" name="oriveti-blackbird-3" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sv7T5ikNirQuWHBUMaGLCk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also a hard shell carrying case, and it does a good job safeguarding the IEMs. You get a good selection of ear tips bundled in the package, and I found that the silicone option had the ideal seal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="M8rj2oQC365H6xE9JmQgYk" name="oriveti-blackbird-9" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8rj2oQC365H6xE9JmQgYk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the Blackbird with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m15s-review">Fiio's excellent M15S</a>, and also tested the IEMs with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19</a>. The Blackbird has two balanced armature drivers aimed at the mid-range and high-end frequencies, with a 10mm dynamic driver handling the low-end. There is some bass exuberance with the IEMs, but I wouldn't call these bass-focused — the 7Hz Legato is still the better choice if you predominantly listen to bass-heavy tunes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="QBC6DJ2nmP2hcnSWRiWvPk" name="oriveti-blackbird-10" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QBC6DJ2nmP2hcnSWRiWvPk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the Blackbird has a clean low-end with some energy and vibrancy. The mid-range comes through with decent clarity, and the bass doesn't overshadow it to any noticeable degree. Treble has good detail, but it doesn't extend to the higher frequencies; on the bright side, there's no sibilance to the sound.</p>
<p>There's a warmth to the tuning that makes the Blackbird enjoyable to use. It's obvious that Oriveti tuned these IEMs for casual listening sessions, and you still get an immersive soundstage. They're not highly technical, but that isn't the point — these are designed to be easy to listen to a variety of genres, and they excel in doing so.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the IEMs are a good choice if you're just getting started and want a set with a bass-forward sound. They're incredibly easy to drive, have a good sound with decent detail retrieval, and you get a durable design along with a terrific value.</p>

I use its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-100w-usb-c-retractable-cable">retractable 100W USB-C cable</a> to charge my daily driver, and it's the only cable I have on my desk. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-blade-2-power-bank-review">Blade 2</a> is a sleek power bank with good charging potential, and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-nomos-140w-charging-station-review">Nomos charging station</a> is an easy recommendation thanks to its integrated Qi 2 charging pad.</p><p>While Baseus is no stranger to power banks, its latest are easily its best yet. The PicoGo Magnetic series is aimed at travel, and it contains the thinnest power banks I've used yet. Baseus has two models available; a 5,000mAh power bank that's just 7.6mm thick, and a 10,000mAh model. The 5,000mAh power bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Card-Size-Magnetic-Lightweight/dp/B0DYJY2MKS">costs just $26 on Amazon</a>, and it's understandable why it is one of the best-selling power banks on the retailer over the last few months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FAjT4LpJi7mmcFFjuSnBdP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FAjT4LpJi7mmcFFjuSnBdP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 10,000mAh model is even more interesting, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Certified-Wireless-10000mAh/dp/B0DY7J8HPQ">comes in at $39 on Amazon</a>. Both power banks have magnetic connectors as standard, and the 10,000mAh model gets Qi 2 integration, giving it an edge in this regard. I've been using both the 5,000mAh and 10,000mAh PicoGo power banks over the course of the last two months, and I like them so much that they're now my go-to choice in everyday use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k9gPt745ie4Wa9dyLiSaPP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9gPt745ie4Wa9dyLiSaPP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's start with the 5,000mAh PicoGo, as its ultra-thin design allows it to be portable like no other power bank. It's thinner than most phones, and at 107g, it is the lightest power bank I used. Baseus sent the grey and pink models, and both designs have aluminum shells that are built to last.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LJCCv4Utfm6h7LjqFR26NP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LJCCv4Utfm6h7LjqFR26NP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design is elegant thanks to smoothly curved sides, and the power bank has strong magnets. It had no issues staying connected to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and even wiggling the phone vigorously didn't dislodge the power bank. There's an LED indicator at the back that shows remaining battery level, and you get a USB-C port at the bottom that lets you charge a secondary device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yPdMkRDbeMzo75cui8PcYP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yPdMkRDbeMzo75cui8PcYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It charges at 15W via MagSafe and 20W with the USB-C port, but as the power budget is 20W, that's what you get in total when charging two devices simultaneously. And because of the energy transfer, you get about 2,800mAh of usable power out of the 5,000mAh model — that's in line with every other power bank I tested recently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QA93sAxA4RfJpCXssKSJbP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QA93sAxA4RfJpCXssKSJbP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the 5,000mAh model isn't enough to charge an Android phone fully — it managed to deliver up to 50% to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> — it is a great choice if you're out and about and need a sleek power bank that doesn't add much heft or bulk to your phone. Combine that with the great design and build quality, and attractive color options, and it is about as straightforward a recommendation as I can make with any charging tech.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JbZ8WTqineB8NqqocSicNP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JbZ8WTqineB8NqqocSicNP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you need more power, then the PicoGo 10,000mAh model is a better choice. It has the same design as its smaller sibling, but it's thicker at 12.7mm, and weighs 221g. It's still a manageable heft and size, and the added bonus is that you get Qi 2 charging, going up to 15W. The 10,000mAh model has the same great set of magnets, and although it is heavier, it manages to stay attached to any phone with a magnetic case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9aK3yjM9poJ87ATUKuQDdP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9aK3yjM9poJ87ATUKuQDdP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It has the same design, you can pick it up in the same color options, and it also gets a USB-C port, this time going up to 27W over the PD standard. The only difference between the two models is that the 10,000mAh variant gets Qi 2, and it has double the battery size.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SGHAmJtNZFrHXEtH6hg4hP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SGHAmJtNZFrHXEtH6hg4hP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It even has a similar charging efficiency, so you'll get around 5,600mAh to 5,700mAh of usable power — more than enough to charge most phones fully. While I tend to use bigger power banks, I found the 5,000mAh model to be better-suited to my needs, and even though it doesn't have enough power to fully charge a phone, it gets most devices to at least 60%, and that's enough to last a good chunk of the day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4SfCG97MXWtyjSKZDL2DcP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SfCG97MXWtyjSKZDL2DcP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given the ultra-thin design and lightweight body, I'd suggest getting the 5,000mAh model; it's just convenient to be able to charge your phone if it's running low. And if you need Qi 2, the 10,000mAh PicoGo is a good option to consider. Basically, these are the two best power banks around if you need a thin-and-light design and reliable power delivery.</p>

<hr>
<p>After teasing the Honor 400 series this week, the company has announced the launch date of the handset models; both products will be unveiled at an event in London on May 22.</p><p>The company has shared a teaser video of the Honor 400 series that reveals the design of both handsets — the Honor 400 and Honor 400 Pro. The company has been teasing about the series for a couple of weeks now, and it is encouraging to see the devices finally getting a launch date.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZwbKypecLUWdBJ2xPEK7v9" name="Honor-400-series-launch-01" alt="Honor 400 series launch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZwbKypecLUWdBJ2xPEK7v9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor also emphasizes that the upcoming phones are AI-powered camera phones featuring a 200MP primary lens. It appears the company is heavily relying on bringing all its AI-powered imaging capabilities to the upcoming handsets.</p><p>Coming back to the teaser, it reveals that the Honor 400 has a flat edge design and dual rear cameras. Meanwhile, the Honor 400 Pro is sporting a triple camera system, a sleek form factor with rounded sides and corners.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Honor has also shared an Easter egg poster, which reveals some of the features of the Honor 400 series. For instance, the hidden clues indicate the launch date, a good telescope camera with likely AI-powered zoom, and some kind of water resistance and fast charging.</p><p>It is interesting to see the company expanding the Honor 400 series to more regions through the global launch. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/uk/phones/honor-400-lite/">Honor 400 Lite</a> launched last month had a similar approach with the expansion in markets like Europe and the U.K. Meanwhile, the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/global/news/honor-300-series-launch-china/">Honor 300 series launch</a> was confined to the Chinese market.</p>

It is now aiming to gain a global presence on the back of interesting launches; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cukteks-40000mah-battery-pack">Cuktech 30</a> is a massive 40,000mAh power bank with a 300W power budget and Qi integration, and the model I'm looking at is the Cuktech 15 Ultra, a 20,000mAh unit with a 165W power budget.</p><p>The Cuktech 15 Ultra is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CUKTECH-20000mAh-Charger-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0DM1RGZHD">available on Amazon for $87</a> as of writing, and that's on the higher end of the scale, particularly when you consider that UGREEN's Nexode 20,000mAh Power Bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHNGDC1">is selling at $59</a>. That said, the build quality of this power bank is among the best of any I used, and it holds up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-prime-27650mah-250w-power-bank-review">Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank</a> — no small feat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bZwYXQKofiZ4DmKVmmLow3" name="cuktech-15-ultra-3" alt="Cuktech 15 Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bZwYXQKofiZ4DmKVmmLow3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before we get started, a note on the naming; Cuktech says it chose its name because of the Čuk DC-DC converter architecture, named after Slobodan Čuk. With that out of the way, let's talk about the design. Similar to Anker and UGREEN, Cuktech went with a vertical profile for the power bank, and it is absolutely the right move — it makes the 15 Ultra that much more portable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KJa8y6GLYKPiGgFqXVwry3" name="cuktech-15-ultra-15" alt="Cuktech 15 Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJa8y6GLYKPiGgFqXVwry3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are other niceties; the grey color scheme with the black front looks clean, and the back has a textured finish that makes it easy to hold the power bank. I don't have any issues with the design of the 15 Ultra, and Cuktech did a good job in this regard.</p>

<p>There's a button up front that activates the panel, and you get to see battery life, time to charge devices, and real-time charging metrics on the same page. Ideally, Cuktech should have pushed the real-time charging details to a secondary page as it makes the panel look a little cluttered, but that's a minor quibble. You get all the information you need, and that's what ultimately matters.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wDYcc2xiwr9rdgCSWyqn34" name="cuktech-15-ultra-9" alt="Cuktech 15 Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wDYcc2xiwr9rdgCSWyqn34.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As it contains a 72Wh battery, there are no issues taking the 15 Ultra onboard a flight. The 20,000mAh size is adequate to charge your phone a few times over, along with a few accessories, and charging efficiency is in line with other brands I tested recently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WidH88zLTd6tWsYXvUPAy3" name="cuktech-15-ultra-18" alt="Cuktech 15 Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WidH88zLTd6tWsYXvUPAy3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, you can't charge a phone with a 5,000mAh battery four times with the 15 Ultra; the inherent energy loss while using the power bank means it has an efficiency of just under 60%, so you'll reasonably get 12,000mAh of charging potential. This is the case with all power banks, so you're not missing out with the 15 Ultra when it comes to charging your tech.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4a5BdVsiuwNDYqsVXKSnx3" name="cuktech-15-ultra-7" alt="Cuktech 15 Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4a5BdVsiuwNDYqsVXKSnx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the power bank has three ports in total — two USB-C and a USB-A connector. The main USB-C port goes up to 140W over the USB PD 3.1 standard, and the secondary USB-C hits 65W. The USB-A port is limited to 18W, so it can only be used with accessories. With both USB-C ports in use, you get a 165W power budget. I'm sharing a rundown of the power profiles, and how the 15 Ultra handles simultaneous charging:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C1 in/out (140W max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-C2 out (65W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-A out (18W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/2A (18W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + USB-C2 out (165W max):</strong> 100W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + USB-A (118W max):</strong> 100W + 18W</li><li><strong>USB-C2 + USB-A (83W max):</strong> 65W + 18W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + USB-C2 + USB-A (163W max):</strong> 100W + 45W + 18W</li></ul>

There's no overheating either, and Cuktech did a good job with thermal management in general.</p><p>Ultimately, the 15 Ultra stands out because of its polished design and reliable charging potential. Although Cuktech is a recent entrant to global markets, it clearly knows what it's doing in this area.</p>

<hr>
<p>The date is set!</p><p>Putting all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-tipped-for-may-debut-new-leak-claims">launch rumors</a> to rest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">multiple teases later,</a> Samsung announced today (May 7) that the fourth variant of the Galaxy S25 series will be unveiled through a virtual Galaxy Unpacked event. The Galaxy S25 Edge is set to drop on May 12 at 8 p.m. ET, and the entire launch will be live-streamed via the OEM's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/">official website</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>The device is being advertised with the tagline "Beyond Slim: Discover Unprecedented Innovation with Galaxy S25 Edge. " It is said to be both a powerful AI companion and an engineering marvel that combines flagship specifications while being light to carry around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5FeTFYje2z29mH34VfNcV4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-MWC-2025-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5FeTFYje2z29mH34VfNcV4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3801" height="2138" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the tagline suggests, the phone is more than just a slim device; it is set out to create a premium user experience. "Every curve, contour, and component reflects a breakthrough in precise engineering," the press release stated.</p><p>While Samsung didn't reveal much of the specs of the device, the press release did focus a lot on the Galaxy S25 Edge's camera. Stating that the device is set out to give users an "ultimate camera experience." As rumors suggested, the Galaxy S25 Edge will indeed show up with a 200 MP wide camera. The company also stated that this lens will be integrated with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which will transform it into a smart lens, "that helps recognize what matters to create new memories."</p><p>While Samsung has teased the phone several times leading up to the launch, it is saving the rest of the specs for D-day. However, with several leaks floating around, we have a good idea of what to expect from this phone.</p>

Unfortunately, they don't work very well with Android phones. If you've been envious of AirPods Pro 2 in the past, you'll be happy to know that the brand-new Powerbeats Pro 2 offer all the best features — and then some — plus full Android compatibility. After using the Powerbeats Pro 2 for months, they're undoubtedly my favorite Android earbuds to date.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cyd6yTNNqLifPvgwWhGYEE" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-2" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cyd6yTNNqLifPvgwWhGYEE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro">big fan of the original Powerbeats Pro</a>, but I'll be the first to admit that they weren't great for everyday wear. They were workout-first earbuds in a form factor that was too bulky and uncomfortable for daily use. Although it took Beats six years to release a new iteration of Powerbeats Pro, the Powerbeats Pro 2 were worth the wait. They directly addressed my concerns, making the latest version well-equipped for everyday use.</p><p>The changes start with a slimmer, more compact form factor — and that goes for both the buds themselves and their charging case. The Powerbeats Pro 2 still have ear hooks, although the new versions are sleeker and follow the natural curvature of your ear. That means, if you choose the right color, they won't look out of place in an office building or coffee shop.</p>

<p>Another reason they're perfect for daily use now is their newfound support for active noise-canceling and transparency mode. The previous generation of Powerbeats Pro were <em>too good</em> at passive sound isolation, meaning I couldn't hold a conversation with the person next to me or order a coffee without taking them out entirely. Now, you get Apple's full suite of ANC modes, meaning you can keep Powerbeats Pro 2 in your ear while having a full conversation or hearing background noise.</p><p>Battery and charging is improved too, as you can get up to 10 hours from the earbuds themselves and up to 45 total hours with the charging case. In other words, you can use Powerbeats Pro 2 during an intercontinental flight without ever needing to pop them into their charging case. Or, you can use the earbuds throughout a week of work (and workouts) without powering up the case.</p><p>When you do need to charge the Powerbeats Pro 2 case, you have a USB-C port and wireless charging options to do so.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-7" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That was enough to sway me into making the Powerbeats Pro 2 my daily driver, as they're fully-featured across my Macs, Windows PCs, iPhone, and Android phones.</p><p>However, if you're looking for even more value, the fact that Powerbeats Pro 2 have an individual heart rate sensor in each earbud could be the differentiating factor. It's using a version of the same technology found in the Apple Watch, and can monitor your heart rate during workouts without needing a separate device.</p><p>Put simply, I think these are a better set of earbuds than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> — two great pairs of Android earbuds — at a now-affordable price of just under $200. They're staying in my ears for the foreseeable future, after I used their predecessor for runs for a full six years.</p>

<p>Clicks Cases' Head of Marketing, Jeffery Gadway, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeffgadway_ive-been-keeping-this-a-secret-but-i-can-activity-7325900777485488128-M_KF" target="_blank">posted</a> on his LinkedIn page that Best Buy will now give away a free Clicks keyboard with every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025</a> pre-order.</p><p>Attaching a poster for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-512gb-unlocked-pantone-mountain-trail/6625232.p?skuId=6625232">Best Buy promotion</a>, Gadaway said that the Clicks for Razr has quickly become the most popular physical keyboard for Android smartphones. He noted that this is a huge milestone for a company that began just 18 months ago, to be bundled up with one of the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on"> best flip phones</a> on the market.</p><p>Just a day after the series launched, Clicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/clicks-keyboard-moto-razr-ultra-2025-combo-launch">revealed</a> a new case that is compatible with the Razr Ultra 2025. The new Clicks keyboard "builds on the hype" the company experienced when it launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-clicks-keyboard-for-my-motorola-razr-can-turn-my-phone-into-what-ive-been-missing">Razr</a>/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-just-crashed-well-below-its-black-friday-price-but-theres-a-catch">Razr Plus 2024</a> version.</p>

<p>According to Gadway, customers who have Clicks cases can be more productive with the pocketable flip phone. Much like AC's Jerry Hildenbrand, who isn't much of an accessories guy, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-clicks-keyboard-for-my-motorola-razr-can-turn-my-phone-into-what-ive-been-missing">quickly became a fan </a>of the Clicks for Razr, even before he got his hands on one.</p><p>To use this nostalgia-inducing case, all you have to do is quickly slot the Razr Ultra into the case and use its keyboard on its cover display, or open it and use it in a more practical scenario. Clicks says its back-lit keys are designed to be "ergonomic" and "contoured," giving users an old-school typing experience on their new phones.</p><p>"By moving the virtual keyboard off the screen, you can tackle typing tasks like email, texts, and instant messages without needing to flip the Razr open," Gadway explained in his post.</p><p>The Clicks case for the Razr Ultra only comes in the Onyx, "off-black" colorway, while the existing Clicks Razr 2024 cases will support the standard Razr and Razr Plus 2025.</p><p>That said, this is a limited-time offer valid on pre-orders of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr 2025 series</a> starting today until June 1 or until supplies last, as stated in the promo poster.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims to have discovered an early build for Samsung's Wear OS update, One UI 8 Watch, which reportedly holds clues about Gemini.</li><li>Gemini is expected in Wear OS in the future and this leak shines a light on its "actions" and the ability to manage scheduled events and more.</li><li>A previous report saw some users notice Gemini's logo appear on Wear OS in the Assistant app, but nothing further was discovered.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Additional information about Google's AI model coming to Wear OS surface, but this time, it's Samsung's One UI in the spotlight.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-8-watch-wear-os-gemini-3555155/">Android Authority</a> highlight a discovery made on X by tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DevOfIpos/status/1919828862088671433">IposDev</a> that reportedly furthers our expectations about Gemini in Wear OS. According to the tipster, they've uncovered an early One UI 8 Watch build, which the publication states contains better insight into how Google's Gemini will function on wearables.</p><p>In its teardown, many strings in the APK point toward Gemini's varied uses for users in their daily lives. A more interesting string directly states "Add a Gemini action." Its code states this could appear as a chip in Samsung's Wear OS skin.</p><p>Elsewhere, the points toward a few of Gemini's uses, like the ability for users to command it to "move my next meeting 30mins later." Other strings highlight things we're familiar with: email summarization and weather reports. However, this code prominently features the word "suggestion," as if the AI will offer its own take on what users should do next with the information it provides. It's probably safe to say these suggestions will appear as small cards to tap, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Moreover, these functions are suspected to be available to users and their vocal commands.</p>

<p>At the start of May, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-assistant-gemini-changes-screen-spotted">a report</a> regarding a tipster's social media post detailed the sudden (small) Gemini cameo on a Galaxy Watch 4. The tipster stated Gemini's diamond/starry logo appeared when launching the Assistant; however, the latter still held control over its core functionality. There was another instance where Gemini's logo appeared in Wear OS' app list instead of the Assistant's.</p><p>We've known since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-may-soon-get-gemini">the beginning of 2025</a>, following a teardown, that Google was seemingly inching toward fully replacing the Assistant in Wear OS with Gemini. Soon after, in March, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-wear-os-sounds-an-awful-lot-like-google-assistant">Google confirmed</a> everyone's suspicions. During that time, an APK dive unearthed various pieces of text, like "Gemini is now on your watch" and "Get started with Gemini." For a wristbound helper, Gemini's support for voice prompts/queries will likely feel like the Assistant, but with better smarts and understanding for complex commands.</p><p>Early findings suggest users will be able to surface Gemini by saying "Hey Google" aloud.</p><p>The "good" thing here is that Google's I/O 2025 event is right around the corner on May 20 at 10 am PT. The company recently teased "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-io-2025-newsletter-teasers">new possibilities</a>" en route to the event, which concern a few Gemini updates. With so much regarding Gemini in Wear OS coming to light, perhaps we'll have more to dig into later this month.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google’s Pixel Watch app is stepping into the light—literally.</p><p>After years of dark-mode dominance, the companion app for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">leading smartwatch models</a> is finally getting a light theme, and it’s not just a simple palette swap.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/06/pixel-watch-app-light-theme/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the update is rolling out via a server-side update to the Pixel Watch app on Android, giving users the option to switch from moody blacks to crisp whites.</p><p>Over the past few days, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch</a> owners over on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1kg9w9t/light_theme/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> have noticed the app adopting a light background. What’s interesting is there’s no built-in theme toggle, and since the last app update (version 3.4) arrived back in April, it looks like Google quietly flipped the switch on its end with a server-side rollout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:195.41%;"><img id="KBAYEurLfhAQNM9tLXBiXM" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-app" alt="Pixel Watch app with light theme" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KBAYEurLfhAQNM9tLXBiXM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="392" height="766" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NicolasDK / Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="not-syncing-with-your-phone-s-theme-2">Not syncing with your phone’s theme</h2>
<p>Some users on Reddit speculated that the app might be syncing with the phone's system-wide theme settings. But so far, there’s no official word to back that up, and early testing kind of shuts that theory down.</p><p>This update follows similar moves by Google, such as introducing a light theme to Pixel Studio in March. That said, some apps like Clock are still sticking to their all-dark vibe, as per 9to5.</p>
<h2 id="watch-os-update-coming-soon-2">Watch OS update coming soon?</h2>
<p>While the Pixel Watch app has embraced a lighter look, the watch itself is still awaiting its next OS update, expected in June. There's speculation about the introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, potentially based on Android 16, at the upcoming Google I/O 2025.</p><p>However, since there’s no developer session lined up for it yet, chances are the Pixel Watch will stick with its current Android 15-based setup for a little while longer.</p>

It's a great deal on a phone that really surprised me, so I'm passing this one along.</p><p>You won't be buying a superphone or anything that should carry the <em>Ultra</em> tag. You're also not paying what you would for one of those. You can get a well-built phone that runs just fine, has a decent camera and a good screen, with one super special surprise if you add a screwdriver and a guitar pick.</p>

<p>I'm not that guy who keeps up with the sales and prices of everything, but I know I should be; saving money is always the best way to buy anything. What I do pay attention to is companies that build something consumer-friendly and different, something that stands out from the rest of the pack.</p><p>That's what the HMD Skyline does. It's a good midrange phone with all the amenities you expect from one, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">one special feature you don't find very often</a>: an easy way to open it up and do something like replace the battery or display. This is what makes me love this phone. It's also the first (and so far, only) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-does-not-require-magnets">Qi2</a> Android phone with built-in MagSafe if that interests you.</p><p>Yes, yes, you can spend a lot more and buy something a lot more powerful or with a better camera. Just don't break the screen, or you'll pay even more for an expensive replacement. With the Skyline, you can use one screwdriver and a guitar pick to follow a simple set of instructions to do that yourself. And yes, you can do it yourself; it's that easy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B84qefYvQspgvS4uvXdceD" name="HMD-Skyline-3.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B84qefYvQspgvS4uvXdceD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not a perfect phone because that doesn't exist. In particular, I have issues with the fact that you'll only be slated to receive two years of official support for a phone you can potentially keep using for a lot longer, but that's just me. I know most people are more than ready to buy something new after two years.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that this is the North American version, listed as officially supported by AT&T, T-Mobile, Cricket, and Tracfone. It could work on other networks, but you need to know what you're buying ,even though it's on sale.</p><p>If you're not worried about having a phone that can boast about its specs, and want the peace of mind that comes with knowing a busted screen isn't going to have you buying another one, this is a phone I can recommend to a lot of people.</p>

<hr>
<p>Netflix executives sat down to announce the beginning of a new TV experience that's preparing to roll out for all members.</p><p>In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/unveiling-our-innovative-new-tv-experience">announcement</a>, Netflix states, "In the coming months," all of its users will receive its newly updated homepage when viewing the platform on a TV. The company's chief product officer, Eunice Kim, stated Netflix wanted the redesign to be "more flexible for our broad entertainment offerings, more intuitive and responsive to our members’ needs."</p><p>What users should prepare to find is an "elevated" Netflix experience on TVs. The company states it reworked its homepage with a "clean and modern" design. Joining these changes is a brighter spotlight on the information that matters for shows and movies. The post says users should find everything they need "front and center" to make an informed decision before interacting.</p><p>Netflix content will feature tags, like "Emmy Award Winner," "#1 in TV Shows," "Recently Added," "New Season," and more.</p><p>The UI is also seeing some TLC, as Netflix says key shortcuts for "My List" and Search will move to the top of your display. Lastly, experience progresses with better real-time recommendations.</p>

<p>The smartphone Netflix experience gets a little love, too, as the company discussed new ways to search and discover. Regarding the former, Netflix will incorporate generative AI to enable the use of "conversational language" when searching. For example, the platform says a user could write "I want something funny and upbeat," and its AI software should narrow things down.</p><p>This feature will arrive as an opt-in beta for iOS users first.</p><p>Additionally, Netflix is preparing to introduce a vertical feed "in the coming weeks." This feed will contain clips of its available shows and movies to (hopefully) entice users into watching. If there is something that catches your eye, Netflix says users can tap to watch that bit of content seamlessly.</p><p>Interestingly, we've seen Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-highlights-smart-tv-home-screen-changes">testing similar changes</a> around this time last year. The company's senior director of product, Pat Flemming, discussed these changes in an interview, stating, the changes should help users cut down on the "gymnastics they do with their eyes." Another change is how cards for shows and movies are offered. When hovered over, these cards will expand to display a quick teaser or preview of what you can expect.</p><p>The test was extremely limited last year, but Netflix is in a place now where it's comfortable enough to roll it out officially for members.</p>

One of my favorite Android phones (and one that I personally bought with a <em>painfully </em>inferior discount) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HX5ZB7"><strong>now selling for as low as $799.99 through the retailer, with the 512GB version chilling at 25% off.</strong></a> The Pixel 9 Pro has only hit this record low price once before, so don&apos;t make the same mistake I did and buy now if you&apos;re interested. </p>

<strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro 512GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HX5ZB7/" data-dimension112="9701f0f0-d7a5-4b9c-8992-acf1cf533322" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,219" data-dimension48="$1,219"><del>$1,219</del> <strong>$919 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>Head to Amazon and buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro with a 512GB storage configuration and you'll get a whopping 25% slashed off your purchase. That's a record low price that the phone has only touched once before, so don't wait too long if you're interested.</p>
<p>If you don't need that much storage, you'll also be happy to learn that the 128GB and 256GB versions of the phone are receiving 20% and 23% discounts, respectively, while the epic 1TB configuration is currently 21% off through Amazon's site. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HX5ZB7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9701f0f0-d7a5-4b9c-8992-acf1cf533322" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,219" data-dimension48="$1,219">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>We gave the Google Pixel 9 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">a glowing 4/5-star review</a> back when the flagship lineup was revealed late last year, and it isn&apos;t hard to see why. The phone boasts a stunning 6.3-inch OLED display that&apos;s simply a joy to use in any light, while under the hood you get 16GB of RAM, the ultra-efficient Tensor G4 processor, and all of the latest AI-boosted software features. As usual with Google phones, the Pixel 9 Pro&apos;s cameras are truly exceptional, plus you get superb haptics and seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. </p><p>That being said, Pixel phones have a reputation for being relatively inefficient when it comes to gaming, and while I&apos;ve never had any issues with simple side-scrollers or puzzle apps, you might want to look for a different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phone</a> if you play graphics-intensive titles like Genshin Impact. You might also have a problem with the Pixel 9 Pro if you&apos;re sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM flicker</a>, so consider doing a little research on that if you&apos;ve had issues before. </p><p>Aside from those few faults, the Google Pixel 9 Pro is an excellent daily driver that I use for just about everything, from streaming TV shows and films to capturing photos and video in 4K resolution. Don&apos;t get me wrong, there are almost always <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/the-best-google-pixel-9-deals-of-the-month">Pixel 9 deals</a> on the web to explore, but if you&apos;re looking for a straight price drop on the Pro, don&apos;t sleep on this discount from Amazon. </p>

<ul><li>Sony has confirmed that its next product launch will involve its Xperia smartphone line, which seemingly points toward the expected Xperia 1 VII.</li><li>The company states its launch event will kick off on May 13 at 11 am JST (May 12 at 10 PM ET).</li><li>Leaks from April suggest the Xperia 1 VII will look largely similar to the Xperia 1 VI with a 6.5-inch display, a triple camera array, and a 5,000mAh battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you've been waiting for the next big thing from Sony, you're in luck because the company's new product launch is coming up fast.</p><p>Sony's Xperia page on X <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/sonyxperia/status/1920036311575974057">posted official confirmation</a> of a "new product announcement" toward the middle of May (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_officially_reveals_the_xperia_1_viis_launch_date_and_its_close-news-67670.php">GSMArena</a>). The company doesn't offer much of a device teaser; however, it's clear by the name and the included photo that we're expecting a smartphone reveal. Sony states the reveal will take place on May 13 at 11 am JST (May 12 at 10 PM ET).</p><p>The company links users to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4vO4znaDPg&ab_channel=Sony%7CXperia">YouTube Premier</a> set for next week, which gives us a little more to think about.</p><p>Accompanied by the "Next ONE is coming" tagline, Sony displays the outline of its next Xperia with one of its cameras. The close-up highlights the camera's FE 1.2/50mm lens before rolling into a few shots of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vi-launch">Xperia 1 VI. </a>The teaser seemingly alludes to more camera enhancements with the expected Xperia 1 VII, stating, "True Quality. Real Emotions."</p>
<h2 id="a-few-xperia-leaks-2">A few Xperia leaks</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Xperia is coming on 13 May!Get ready for the Xperia New Product Announcement, exclusively on @SonyXperia YouTube: https://t.co/FrBWgOMjcq13 May (TUE), 2025 11:00 Japan time / 04:00 CEST#SonyXperia #ProductAnnouncement #NextXperia<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1920036311575974057">May 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>With the Xperia 1 VII around the corner, it's time to take a look back at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vii-renders-leak-revealing-device-design">few leaks from April</a> that might bring its offerings into perspective. To start, the phone's renderings seemingly surfaced, showcasing a design language similar to its predecessor, the Xperia 1 VI. However, the upcoming model looks slightly taller in its renders, and with a couple of noticeable chins above and below its display.</p><p>Thinner bezels line the sides, but the larger chins might be something to get used to if true.</p><p>Its supposed specifications include a 6.5-inch display with a purported 19.5:9 aspect ratio. Sony is expected to implement Android 15 in the Xperia 1 VII, as well as a 5,000mAh battery with 30W wired charging capabilities. The phone is said to feature a dedicated camera button along its right edge, with a volume rocker and power button.</p><p>A triple camera array is expected on its rear panel, like its past-gen version. Specs for those lenses weren't detailed; however, the Xperia 1 VI offered a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP telephoto, and a 12MP ultrawide.</p><p>AI was at the center of Sony's last Xperia, and it seems like we can expect more of the same this year, too. One of its main features was AF tracking with "human pose estimation." The device could track the human body and track it with "precision" even through objects.</p>

Its latest product is the Flash Pro Ultra, a 25000mAh power bank that lets you charge up to six devices at once. As someone who has way too many power banks, I wanted to take a look at the Flash Pro Ultra, and see how it holds up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-prime-27650mah-250w-power-bank-review">Anker's Prime 27650mAh</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-25000mah-power-bank-review">UGREEN Nexode 25000mAh power banks</a>.</p><p>The Flash Pro Ultra secured over $400,000 in crowdsourced funding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/asaptechnologies/flash-pro-ultra">via Kickstarter</a>, and it is now doing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flash-pro-ultra-1st-275w-powerbank-w-oled-screen#/">another round on Indiegogo</a> if you're interested. Chargeasap is selling the power bank at $179, which it says is a 46% discount over the $329 retail pricing. As an overview, Anker's Prime 27650mAh power bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">retails for $179 on Amazon</a>, and the UGREEN Nexode 25000mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-25000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHM5RY2">is down to $99</a>.</p>

<p>Power banks have gotten sleeker in the last two years, but that isn't the case with the Flash Pro Ultra; it has a utilitarian design and is considerably bigger than most 25000mAh power banks I used recently. It is made out of plastic, but the build quality doesn't feel quite as robust as recent Anker and UGREEN options.</p>

<p>Coming in at 596g, it is the same weight as the UGREEN Nexode 25000mAh power bank, but as it doesn't have a vertical design, it isn't as portable. The upside is that you get additional charging ports; there's a 15W MagSafe charging puck at the front, and a dedicated pad to charge the Apple Watch or Samsung Watch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GZkRyiRseKJHYrLgfobPrQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-5" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GZkRyiRseKJHYrLgfobPrQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Annoyingly, I got the variant that charges the Samsung Watch, so I wasn't able to test it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch Series 10</a>. Chargeasap sends out a survey to all backers asking about the model of choice, so if you're interested in this power bank, know that you can choose between the two.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HRkMJY7KoBdGVdo5sH8MrQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-12" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HRkMJY7KoBdGVdo5sH8MrQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 15W Qi charging pad sits flush with the body, but it pops out should you need to use it. I tested it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and it did a decent enough job. The magnet is strong enough that it doesn't dislodge the phone, and my only worry in this area is the durability of the mechanism; there were instances where the pad didn't pop out fully, and I had to push it back in and try again.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t3XuB53ht92KsF5UomyhnQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-11" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t3XuB53ht92KsF5UomyhnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a tiny OLED panel that shows battery level, thermals, and time left to charge connected devices, and a second press of the button on the side shows real-time charging details. The panel gets adequately bright, and I didn't see any issues viewing the text while outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="drifxVYjVsTigpSCUKWinQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-15" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/drifxVYjVsTigpSCUKWinQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power bank has a glossy finish that picks up smudges with relative ease, and the sides have a grooved design that makes it a little easier to hold. You get three USB-C ports alongside one USB-A, with the main USB-C port able to hit 140W. The USB-C2 port does 100W, and USB-C3 maxes out at 60W, just like the USB-A connector.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MM4eKtkdJf82ZmdniGSkkQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-6" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MM4eKtkdJf82ZmdniGSkkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the Flash Pro Ultra is branded as a 275W power bank, it doesn't actually hit that figure; in my testing, I found it go up to 200W while charging several devices at once, and the key advantage you're getting with the device is the ability to charge up to six devices at once. Most other power banks in this category have three ports as standard, so you're essentially getting increased flexibility when it comes to charging all your gear.</p>

<p>As it has a 90.75Wh battery, there are no issues taking the power bank onboard a flight — it's under the 100Wh limit enforced by most countries. It did just as well at charging various devices as the UGREEN Nexode alternative, and I didn't see any issues using it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and a dozen or so accessories.</p>

<p>On the whole, I like the convenience on offer with the Flash Pro Ultra; it is easily able to charge more devices than its immediate rivals, and the inclusion of a 15W charging pad is a decent differentiator. That said, the build quality isn't as good, and I don't know how the product holds up over long-term use. I've had it for just over a month now, and while I didn't see any issues outside of the charging pad getting stuck, it doesn't have the same rugged durability of the Nexode 25000mAh power bank.</p>

<ul><li>Honor Magic 7 Pro gets access to Android 16 Beta 3 and test run, and see what this new OS feels like on their phones.</li><li>The company put out a detailed guide for developers and advanced users who'd like to test out the new software.</li><li>Honor cautions that this is not for general users and says that there's a low probability of the phone restarting in some scenarios once it is updated.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor announced today that those with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> device will be able to experience <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> Beta 3 as it has been made available for developers. In an email to Android Central,  the company added that the HONOR Magic7 Pro is one of the first phones globally to support this preview.</p><p>The company added that this Android 16 Beta 3 preview will give developers early access to new features and performance of the OS, firsthand. It will also give them access to new APIs and tools that could help developers fine-tune the user experience before the stable version of the OS is officially launched later in June.</p>

<p>That said, it should be noted that Pixel phones are currently on<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-drops-android-16-beta-4-before-the-big-stable-launch-in-may"> Android 16 Beta 4</a>, but this is the first Android 16 beta version available for the Honor's Magic 7 Pro.</p><p>"This marks another milestone in HONOR’s close collaboration with Google. HONOR was also among the first to roll out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> Beta 1 in 2024 for the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review"> Magic 6 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2,</a>" the company said in an email.</p><p>Furthermore, in a detailed post, the company laid out steps for developers to safely upgrade their phones. And if you are a general user, the company recommends that you wait until the official stable launch of the OS later this year.</p><p>Developers who plan on installing the Beta version can do so through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.honor.com/en/tg/android16">Honor's official page</a>, which has the upgrade package uploaded onto the website. All that you need to do is download the corresponding upgrade package based on your device. Make sure adb, Python environment, and Honor Suite are available for PC. Secondly, developers need to have more than 60GB of space on their phones.</p>

<p>Following this, go to <strong>Settings > About phone</strong>, tap <strong>Build number</strong> seven times to enable developer mode, then go to <strong>System & updates > Developer options</strong> to enable <strong>USB debugging</strong> and connect the device to PC via USB cable.  The next steps are detailed in Honor's blog post.</p><p>Lastly, the OEM notes that this upgrade will not erase any data, and recommends that you back up your phone beforehand.</p><p>"The upgraded new system adopts a brand new user partition, which is not shared with the original one, and the data of the original user partition is unavailable on the new system," the company added.</p>

<p>Instagram is playing around with a new way to lock down Reels using a secret code, maybe even with a hint to help out. The company has teamed up with The Weeknd to roll it out for the first time and see how it plays.</p><p>This new feature gives creators a cool way to boost engagement with their content. It also lets artists and influencers drop exclusive short videos just for their fans—the ones sharp enough to crack the clue.</p><p>To kick things off, The Weeknd is dropping an unreleased sneak peek from his upcoming clip Hurry Up Tomorrow using the new secret-code Reels. The hint to crack the code is "CLEAN TITLE FOR TRACK 3."</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/instagram">Instagram</a> is toying with this new feature to help creators stir up buzz and drop content that feels more like a secret club.</p><p>The Meta-owned social network has been quietly experimenting with the feature on its Design account.</p><p>This new feature also gives creators and brands a fun way to kick off promos or marketing campaigns.

<p>For everyday users, this feature offers a nifty way to share content only with a select group of friends.</p>
<h2 id="been-here-before-2">Been here before?</h2>
<p>This isn’t Instagram’s first rodeo with exclusive content. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/05/new-stickers-in-instagram-stories/" target="_blank">reminiscent of its “Reveal” Stories feature</a> from last year. With those, you could post a hidden Story that only unlocked if followers hit you up directly. It aims to spark closer connections and get people more involved.</p><p>Locked Reels could offer regular users a fun, more private way to share with close friends. But not everyone might be into dealing with secret codes, especially with how busy and info-packed the platform already is.</p><p>This feature is just another addition to Instagram’s toolbox of interactive tricks, but whether it’ll really take off is anybody's guess.</p>

<h2 id="you-need-a-good-id-vault-more-than-ever-2">You need a good ID vault more than ever</h2>
<p>A new feature for Android was announced, and it's likely that most people didn't notice or care about it: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-enhances-digital-credentials-access-with-androids-open-standards-support">on-device support for OpenID standards</a>.</p><p>It makes sense; this sounds like a really nerdy thing that nobody asked for and you have no intentions of using, but it's not. Well, OK, not very many people asked for it, but only because they had no idea it existed or that it was needed. We do need it, and you will end up using it.</p>
<p>How this all works is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/identity/digital-credentials/credential-verifier" target="_blank">a rabbit hole of tech</a> that is really difficult to understand completely, but easy to see the high-level picture.</p><p>You'll enter a form of verified digital ID, like a driver's license or a passport, into a wallet app. This app uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html" target="_blank">OpenID open-source standards</a> to ensure it's secure — plenty of eyes are on its code and actively trying to break it. It will never be 100% foolproof because nothing ever is, but it's pretty secure.</p><p>That app doesn't need to do anything other than be a place to store these credentials. In fact, I'd say that's all it should ever do because that's a really important thing. Think of it as a big, heavy-duty bank vault to hold your ID.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mtV4A7b79jaWGYJCzwSLeW" name="Add passport to Google Wallet" alt="Add passport to Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mtV4A7b79jaWGYJCzwSLeW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When another app needs to verify who you are, examples given include Amazon, CVS, or Uber. You pick your ID from the list, and that ID vault app sends the relevant details securely between them. You don't have to take a photo of anything or send a copy of your driver's license to Amazon, or anything else. The app knows who to ask (the Digital Wallet, or ID vault) and knows what to do with the information it is given.</p><p>All this is done on your phone, it's all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-googles-backup-encryption-works-good-bad-and-ugly">encrypted</a>, and it's surely going to be easy to wipe all details if you need to do it.</p><p>All you have to do is enter your ID into the right app, and the rest is done for you. Normally, I don't like it when things happen automatically, but this is not one of those times. I know if done properly, this system will do a much better job of keeping my identity secure than I ever could. My only problem is making the right choice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XHbi4ptDLYz9wvFDtaMDQZ" name="Google-Wallet-logo-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024" alt="The Google Wallet logo on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XHbi4ptDLYz9wvFDtaMDQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem isn't really a problem: regular users (that'd be you and me) don't need to know about any of this for it to be effective. We can just use it and benefit without knowing any better. But that means we either need Google to act in a very walled-garden way and act as a gatekeeper for which developers can use it and how, or we have to make the right choice.</p><p>The first isn't likely to happen and probably shouldn't happen. Companies like Google and Apple control the mobile phone market, and giving them even more power <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-sues-google-and-samsung-anti-competitive-case">is a bad idea</a>. In Google's case, with an enormous amount of leverage worldwide through Android, it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-be-forced-to-split-up-chrome-and-android-over-antitrust-concerns"><em>very</em> bad idea</a>.</p><p>That means you have to be able to trust someone. So, who to trust?</p>
<p>That's tricky. The only thing I trust a tech company to do is things that benefit it. Having said that, I know that you can trust a company like Google (or Apple, if you use an iPhone) or Samsung because they have too much to lose if they screw it up. Google says 1Password is also going to incorporate this more secure "ID vault" feature as well, and we can probably trust them, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3375px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="X7hXneZDSgYkAMBeaPL3ii" name="android-digital-credentials-selection-interface" alt="Android Digital Credentials selection interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7hXneZDSgYkAMBeaPL3ii.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3375" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Who you <strong>can't</strong> trust is the better way to think about it. There could be a development team out there that can do this so much better than Google or Samsung ever will. There could also be people who just want to make a quick buck, do the very basics, then stop caring. Until you can determine which is which, <strong>you can't trust either</strong>.</p>
<p>I know that's awfully cynical and a little unfair. I don't care, and neither should you.</p><p>When that amazing app that does a great job hits the scene, a lot of eyes will be on it. The right people will look at it, and they'll tell you if it's as great as claimed or if it's just a dud. You need to let those right people have a long, hard look and trust them, knowing they know a lot more about this than we do. Unless, of course, you are one of those right people; if so, make sure to tell the rest of us what you think, OK?</p><p>When everything is finally squared away and this is how we handle identity verification in the future (I think it will happen and know it <em>needs</em> to happen), do the smart thing. Install <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallets-installment-payments-and-tap-to-send-features-show-up-in-the-app">Samsung Wallet</a> and use it. Don't be tempted by something with a fancy UI or shiny bits until someone tells you you should.</p>
