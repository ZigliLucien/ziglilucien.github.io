<h2 id="there-s-only-three-ways-you-can-go-when-choosing-a-motorola-razr-plus-2025-color-2">There's only three ways you can go when choosing a Motorola Razr Plus 2025 color</h2>
<p>To make it simple, you only have three options when Motorola Razr Plus 2025. It comes in pink, brown, and blue. Depth, tone, and texture bring a lot of much-needed context to the three color variants. Of course, getting a good look at all the options is your primary step. That's why this guide focuses on explaining the finish in detail before helping you pick on shade to buy.</p><p>Now that you've seen the shades, you know that all three Razr Plus 2025 finishes are either leather or similar to satin. If you don't or do prefer a certain texture, that's already enough for you to narrow down the colorways. For example, only Hot Pink comes with a satin finish, so you can either prioritize that or cut it out of your shortlist.</p><p>The two vegan leather options also differ slightly, as the Midnight Blue option is an imitation of basic leather. Meanwhile, Mocha Mousse is a lot more complex as it is speckled with little dark spots just like grains of coffee in an actual cup of mocha.</p><p>Based on how much of a grainy texture you like, Mocha Mousse may or may not be the perfect fit for you. It all depends on your preferences and style. Personally, I find that this tan coffee-colored foldable is the most stunning variant of the Motorola Razr Plus 2025. That's a tough call even for someone like me because I adore pink and I love the legacy of that shade on the Razr.</p><p>Even so, Mocha Mousse plays with texture and brings something new to the table. The little details like the dark specks are such an underrated touch. It's definitely the Razr Plus 2025 colorway that stands out the most. So if you're still confused after all this advice, go for it.</p><p>And if you're not even sure about which exact model of the Razr 2025 series you're looking to purchase, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">a handy guide for that</a> too.</p>

<ul><li>Android 16 is about to bring a robust Battery Health page to Pixel phones with key performance data.</li><li>The page will show estimated battery capacity as a real-time percentage compared to a new battery.</li><li>Notably, Google is confirming that only the Pixel 8a and newer will receive the useful features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is adding a Battery Health statistics page to the Settings app for Pixel phones with Android 16, but most models won't be supported. The company says that the feature will be available "on Pixel 8a and Pixel 9 products including 9 Pro Fold" in a reply to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/403373209?pli=1#comment6" target="_blank">Issue Tracker</a> ticket concerning Battery Health availability. That leaves out all Pixel models released before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, including the rest of the Pixel 8 series and the original Pixel Fold.</p><p>"The Battery Health Indicator feature is currently supported in Beta 3 on Pixel 8a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> products including 9 Pro Fold," a Google employee wrote on May 1. "Due to product limitations, this feature will not be available on older in-market Pixel devices."</p><p>Newer Google Pixel devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-check-android-phone-battery-health">already showed cycle count data</a> as of last year, but the Battery Health page is set to bring more detailed analytics. Specifically, battery capacity will be shown as a percentage compared to its new state. This should give users an easy-to-understand idea of how their battery will perform on a daily basis, even years after their phone purchase.</p>

<p>"This [battery capacity] is an estimated percentage of charge the battery can currently hold compared to a new standard battery," the Battery Health page in the Android 16 beta explains. "Battery capacity decreases over time."</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-might-finally-introduce-battery-health-feature-with-android-16">Battery Health page</a> shows a green checkmark and a <strong>Normal</strong> status if the battery is working as expected. It also offers quick links to battery-related support articles, and lists any charging optimization features that are enabled — such as Adaptive Charging.</p><p>While it's unclear what "product limitations" prevent Pixel phones older than the Pixel 8a from supporting the Battery Health page, it may have something to do with the batteries themselves.</p><p>Starting with the Pixel 8a, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15738128?hl=en" target="_blank">Google says</a> Pixel phones can reach 1,000 charge cycles before needing a battery replacement. Older Pixel phones, namely the Pixel 3 through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and Pixel Fold, are only rated for up to 800 charge cycles before a battery replacement is recommended.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, and the Battery Health feature for Pixels, will likely be shown off at Google I/O 2025.

<p>Motorola went all out with the Razr 2025 launch. The colorways themselves are exceptional. Sure, we've seen brands like OnePlus and Xiaomi play around with textures before. But Motorola left no holes barred, giving us four unique textures and color options across the board for every Razr 2025 model.</p><p>With all those options, it's only natural that this decision isn't easy. And that's after you've decided on which model you want to buy.</p><p>I'm here to simplify this process for you. Each one of the Motorola Razr 2025 colorways are epic, so regardless of what you choose don't doubt yourself. However, if you simply can't break the tie between a few shades, I'd say go for the uniquely textured Lightest Sky variant.</p><p>That stunning marble-like back is so opulent and grand, you'll start sticking your pinky out whilst sipping on tea. It's the best take on the beige/cream colorway that Samsung, Google, Apple, and many other name brands have dabbled in before. All of them pale in comparison to Motorola's way of doing things.</p>

<p>Let's go a little more in-depth about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025</a> and its last-gen counterpart, the Razr 2024. Both devices have the exact same measurements, and they even weigh the same.</p><p>It's not always true that these factors determine whether you can use the same case on both phones though. After all, Samsung is notorious for changing camera lens positions or button placement just enough that you can't use an older case on a newer phone model. However, Motorola didn't go down that path and we are thankful for it.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-vs-razr-2024">Motorola Razr 2025 and the Motorola Razr 2024</a> are mirror images of each other, except for the color options (and of course the internals are completely different, but that doesn't matter here). Everything from the button placement to the location of the cameras is identical. This is what makes it possible for you to use a Motorola Razr 2024 case on the newer Razr 2025.</p><p>In fact, most smartphone case manufacturers that cater to Motorola didn't even bother to release new cases made specifically for the Motorola Razr 2025. As far as I've seen, a good 80% to 90% of them have just renamed their pre-existing product listings for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-2024-cases">Razr 2024 cases</a> to include the Razr 2025.</p><p>This isn't a bad thing. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Manufacturers don't need to make a new mould to make new cases for the latest Razr model, so the price stays the same. And since the Razr 2024 is already old now, its cases are cheaper than they were at the Razr 2024 launch.</p><p>This means all Razr 2025 owners have access to a cheaper and much more diverse and wider assortment of cases than they would if they had bought another newly launched phone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>. The cherry on top is that it's good for the environment too, since you can reuse your old case should you choose to upgrade. Everybody wins.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a Samsung user looking for a great deal on wireless earbuds; you value great sound and noise cancellation in your audio equipment.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t regularly use Samsung devices; you&apos;re looking to spend $100 or less on earbuds. </p><p>As we described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">our Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review</a>, these wireless earbuds are pretty much perfect for any user already immersed in the Galaxy ecosystem. Pairing the buds with a newer Galaxy phone like Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> will let you experience Samsung&apos;s proprietary SSC (Samsung Scalable Codec) technology in action. This means you&apos;re getting better dynamic range, clearer audio, and less noise when you use the Buds 3 Pro. These premium earbuds also deliver 24-bit hi-res support with spatial audio, up to 30 hours of battery life, and active noise cancellation (ANC) straight out of the box. </p><p>Of course, if you aren&apos;t a Galaxy user and you just want a great pair of earbuds, something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5</a> may be a better, albeit more expensive, choice. Furthermore, Google Pixel users may be better off skipping these Samsung earbuds altogether and buying something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>. Needless to say, there are plenty of excellent wireless earbuds to choose from nowadays, but if you&apos;re already a Samsung user, this might just be the best earbuds deal on the web today.</p>

<hr>
<p>One UI 8 rumors press on, and a new set claims Samsung is working on upgrading the security/privacy of a key Knox security feature.</p><p>Tipster IposDev has allegedly been sifting through an early Samsung One UI 8 build, claiming the OS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DevOfIpos/status/1919344240036872260">will upgrade Secure Folder</a> with Google software (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-8-to-make-samsungs-secure-folder-even-more-secure/">SamMobile</a>). Supposedly, the early test build offers insight into the API swap of Secure Folder from Samsung's old work profile preference to Google's Private Spaces.</p><p>In the comments, the tipster responded to a user, stating, "There are some private space APIs on the system side." The tipster went further, adding that they went through the profile IDs, which apparently doubles down on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-secure-folders-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">Secure Folder's</a> swap to Private Spaces.</p><p>The provided snapshots don't highlight any sort of forward-facing change for users. Secure Folder's description reads mostly the same, highlighting its ability to provide "an extra layer of protection" for items you want to keep secure and private on your device, like apps, photos, and more.</p>

<p>This change could be beneficial for users as Secure Folder previously leveraged Android's Work Profiles to separate your data — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-most-secure-feature-seems-to-have-a-few-holes">and that backfired</a>. A vulnerability in One UI 7 was discovered earlier this year, which exposed users' media files in Secure Folder (images, videos) to other apps, which wasn't supposed to happen. This problem was reportedly restricted to people who had <em>physical </em>access to your device.</p><p>Work profiles set up by third-party apps for Secure Folder were also at risk during the initial discovery. Samsung acknowledged the extreme security flaw in February 2025, but didn't offer a potential solution. However, with what's presently rumored for One UI 8, perhaps this is the fix we're looking for.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Private Spaces</a> was announced by Google during its 2024 I/O event as a tool to help users safeguard their important, sensitive data. The feature, when enabled, would create a new area on a user's Pixel to store sensitive apps and data. Private Spaces requires users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-create-private-space-for-your-apps-on-pixel">create a whole new PIN</a> (or fingerprint) for maximum safety.</p><p>It's been a day for One UI 8 rumors, as a recent report stems from a user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/someone-with-a-galaxy-s25-ended-up-getting-an-alleged-one-ui-8-update">who allegedly got One UI 8 working</a> on a Galaxy S25. The user showed off Samsung's changes to the weather app, like 3D images and animations, as well as the phone call update to the Now Bar. More news on One UI 8 might await us at Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">summer Unpacked</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables and more, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<hr>
<p>Google's experimental versions of Gemini 2.5 Pro are getting a boost, as there's a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/" target="_blank">Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview</a> (I/O edition) model available for tasks that involve coding and advanced reasoning. The early access comes ahead of Google I/O 2025, an annual developer conference later this month, the company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-pro-updates/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The full update will be released at the event, but the preview is already a top performer on key AI benchmarks.</p><p>Users will find "meaningful improvements for front-end and UI development, alongside improvements in fundamental coding tasks such as transforming and editing code, and creating sophisticated agentic workflows," the company explained in a separate post on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-pro-io-improved-coding-performance/" target="_blank">Google for Developers blog</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview</a> ranks first on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.lmarena.ai/leaderboard" target="_blank">WebDev Arena leaderboard</a> at the time of publishing, a benchmark that specifically tests AI models' performance in web development exercises. It tops <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet" target="_blank">Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a>, which now holds second place. Google holds two of the top three WebDev Arena leaderboard spots, with Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental still holding third place.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Pixel 9 Pro is poking fun at Apple over a recent string of iPhone 17 rumors.</li><li>The rumors suggest the device could adopt a horizonal camera bar, which looks a lot like the latest Pixel lineup.</li><li>Google's design director stated last summer that the Pixel 9's large camera bump is a product of consumer interests, as people want to take good, high-quality photos.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's #BestPhonesForever series is back, and this time, the company is teasing Apple over a rumor.</p><p>Google posted a new entry to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/A26C66LX2AA">series on YouTube</a>, saying the show's host, Pixel, is "Responding to the Rumors" with its best buddy, the iPhone. The two devices are discussing the recent string of rumors regarding Apple's potential design for the iPhone 17. As talks begin, the iPhone says, "It's crazy, can you imagine me doing the same thing you did first years later?" The Pixel quips back, "Sounds pretty far-fetched."</p><p>One look at this rumored design can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1igpd3m/iphone_17_air_features_google_pixel_look/">be seen on Reddit</a>, where users discussed the purported new Pixel-like look. The rumored render shows Apple's iPhone with a horizontal camera bar situation, which gives us serious Pixel 9 series vibes.</p><p>On the other hand, our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/google-pokes-fun-at-apple-for-the-iphone-17s-rumored-pixel-style-redesign">TechRadar</a> highlighted a set of alleged CAD renderings, which continue the horizontal bar narrative. Image runs through a few variations, even a small vertical island, but the Pixel-esque design is still apparent. However, as the publication notes, the rumors suggest the bar will be slightly higher on the device and could expand even more for Apple's iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max if it's to be believed.</p>
<h2 id="google-s-unapologetic-camera-bar-2">Google's Unapologetic Camera Bar</h2>

<p>Regardless, these are nothing but rumors, as the Pixel and iPhone state in their podcast. Google didn't end there with the rumors, as the iPhone walked through other ways Apple "copied" the Pixel. The video highlights Google's Night Sight and Apple's Night Mode "a year later." There's also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> and Clean Up comparison, too.</p><p>Google's Pixel 9 series camera bar is (unapologetically) huge, but the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">design director says there's a reason why</a>. Last August, Claude Zellweger, Google's Director of Design for Pixel phones, held an interview where they discussed <em>why </em>the camera bump is the way it is. The main takeaway was that the Pixel 9's camera bar was the product of consumer interests. Zellweger stated Google understands that consumers want the ability to take good, high-quality pictures.</p><p>Achieving such a feat, in a handheld device like a phone, requires strong sensors and lenses. Those pieces of hardware aren't small or thin, thus the massive camera bump we have today. Zellweger teased that the major bump might not last forever, and that's recently come true with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">the Pixel 9a</a> reveal.</p><p>Some of you may remember Google's #BestPhonesForever ad campaign from the company's efforts to draw awareness to the similarities between its Pixel and the iPhone. A previous one we've covered involved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-campaign-best-phones-forever">Pixel 7 Pro highlighting its ability</a> to unblur photos and capture the night sky, while also providing a VPN to users. Google also showed off the Pixel Fold, poking Apple as it's yet to create a foldable iPhone. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnKtcw5mIGUR-aMBz9AphxHzEH7Kt-azY">28 videos in total</a>, all of which feature banter between the two devices.</p>

This means you'll get the basic wireless charging compatibility but won't benefit from the improved magnetic alignment or faster speeds offered by Qi2-enabled devices.</p></article></section>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025</a> family offers several upgrades, including improved batteries on some models. While the battery capacity has increased (on the Razr and Ultra models), the phones still use the original Qi standard, which remains the most common and widely supported option for wireless charging.</p><p>One benefit of Qi is that it works seamlessly with a broader range of existing chargers. In contrast, Qi2, although backward compatible, is primarily found in iPhones and a few newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">2025 Android flagship devices</a>, offering additional features, such as magnetic alignment, which none of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025 models</a> support.</p><p>Qi2 charging would have been a plus due to the magnetic alignment, which makes positioning easier and results in faster and more efficient charging. The latest charging technology reduces heat through precise alignment and helps preserve battery health over time, providing a more reliable charging experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For most Android users, the Razr 2025 lineup's lack of Qi2 likely won't be a dealbreaker. The first-gen Qi standard still provides reliable charging speeds and is suitable for everyday use, such as overnight or casual daily top-offs. Nonetheless, without Qi2's magnetic alignment, Razr 2025 model owners must be more cautious when placing the phone on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers" target="_blank">wireless charging pad</a> to ensure proper positioning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7bNDiJnnfpHtFReerYVuDQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-1" alt="The Razr 2025 next to the Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bNDiJnnfpHtFReerYVuDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4136" height="2327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, why did Motorola decide not to include the Qi2 charging technology in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr 2025 series</a>? Talking specifically about the Razr Ultra, Motorola said that "incorporating Qi2 charging would have compromised the design due to the size of the magnet." Motorola did not specifically comment on the other Razr 2025 models, but none include Qi2 support, nor do they appear to support the Qi2 standard, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which is "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 Ready</a>."</p><p>If you want the fastest wired charging, you'll need a Motorola TurboPower charger of 33W or higher. The Razr 2025 and Razr Plus 2025 support 15W wireless charging, while the Ultra supports 30W wireless charging, which is still plenty fast. Be cautious when using other chargers, as they are not recommended and may harm the charging performance.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola shows no signs of slowing down, as a new set of leaks surfaces about another upcoming phone.</p><p>Well-known <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1919399217031762112">X tipster Evan Blass</a> posted a screenshot of the upcoming Moto G56 midrange phone, and its supposed specs in totality. While the entire alleged spec sheet is there for the taking, there's one striking highlight: Motorola's supposed varied OS update support for <em>each </em>RAM variant. According to the post, the Moto G56 could arrive with a 4GB and 8GB RAM model for its available 128/256GB internal storage pairs.</p><p>However, the spec sheet claims the 4GB RAM version could receive one OS upgrade (one year) and three years of "bi-monthly" security updates. The 8GB variant is said to bring two years of OS upgrades and four years of bi-monthly security updates.</p><p>It's a strange rumor, to say the least. So, we'll have to see what happens for certain once the device launches.</p>
<h2 id="unwrapping-the-leaks-2">Unwrapping the leaks</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Bogota" pic.twitter.com/aijaaTzHpj<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1919399217031762112">May 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Aside from that, the tipster's post suggests the Moto G56 will debut with a flat, rounded-corner 6.7-inch LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate. Internally, the device is supposedly powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7060. It's unclear if the back sports some sort of texture (like a faux leather); however, the device's rendering shows a squared dual camera array. Inside is a 50MP primary lens and an 8MP ultrawide camera.</p><p>Giving you a boost during the day is reportedly a 5,200mAh battery, shored up by 33W wired charging strength.</p><p>The rumored Moto G56 is the next-gen follow-up to the G5 from 2024, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/moto_g56_specs_leak_along_with_an_officiallooking_render-news-67655.php">GSMArena</a> states is a bit different. The publication highlights notable changes Motorola is seemingly preparing. The upcoming G56 specifically features a larger display and a slightly bigger battery compared to its predecessor.</p><p>The X leak concludes by stating the G56 could feature Pantone Black Oyster, Gray Mist, Dazzling Blue, and Dill color options. The G55 dropped in August last year, so there's a chance Motorola <em>could </em>try and keep the launch this year close to that.</p>

<p>Motorola's been cruising recently, dropping a couple of phone launches in April. One of the most notable reveals was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">the Moto Razr 2025 trio</a>, which introduced consumers to the Razr Ultra. While all three foldables sport Android 15 out of the box, a key highlight is the addition of new Moto AI features and enhanced camera capabilities. The Ultra model even brings back a wood variant that feels like a blast from Motorola's storied past.</p><p>Regarding the recent Moto G56 leak, the company unveiled its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-60-fusion-announced">Edge 60 Fusion</a> early last month. The design language is quite similar to what we're seeing rumored today: a square camera array, flat display, and rounded corners. The Edge 60 Fusion is a mid-range device with immense durability, thanks to Corning Gorilla Glass 7i and the MIL-STD 810H standard.</p>

<p>It has been raining One UI 8 leaks for the past few weeks. The most recent one comes from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25</a> user who took to X to post screenshots of the software update screen showcasing the alleged One UI 8.</p><p>The first set of images was posted on May 4, revealing all the details of the update, including the build number: BP2A.250605.015.S938BXXU3BYE2. Although the precise timing of the update notification remains unclear, the image hints that the update came along with this month's security patch.</p>

<p>There's a high possibility that this user is seeing a pre-release build that Samsung could be testing out on select Galaxy S25 users. Following the initial post, the user took to X to post other UI changes that came with the supposed One UI 8 update. This includes the recent rumors about the major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsungs-one-ui-8-leak-reveals-enhanced-weather-app-with-upgraded-animations">changes</a> to the weather app, showcasing upgraded 3D images and animations</p><p>The tipster also posted screenshots of new watch faces with the UI update that allows users to change fonts and other complications on them.</p><p>They also shared a video of the improved interface with the One UI 8 update, showing apps like the Weather app opening and closing much faster and smoother.</p><p>Beyond that, a blur effect appeared when the user attempted to access media, revealing options for viewing it.

I've been doing it since I was a kid, and it's something I look forward to every spring. But I've got a full-time job. My wife is a full-time teacher. We've got one kid and are fiercely protective of our family time, despite all the extracurricular activities that come with having an 11-year-old boy. Plus, we've got a house, pets, and a seemingly endless supply of things to fix and people to visit.</p><p>All of that means there's relatively little time for gardening, even though we love it. Thankfully, I've got a little weed-eating robot named Tertill to help me with the arduous task of weeding, and a clever AI-powered app called Seedtime that helps me plan everything I want to do this season.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use.

<p>I've been using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tertill-Garden-Weeding-Robot-Automatically/dp/B08NXQPZPG">Tertill</a> for years, and this marks the first season since its inception that the product is officially sold out for the foreseeable future. The little $150 robot roams around your garden plot like an old Roomba, covering as much ground as it can in short bursts of time.</p><p>The robot runs off a solar-powered rechargeable battery and has cambered wheels so it's stabilized even when the ground isn't perfectly flat. Sensors keep it from running over tall plants, while another sensor on the underside senses small weeds and uses the built-in weed wacker to remove them from your garden’s existence.</p><p>While Tertill has helped me over the years with one of the most time-consuming tasks in the garden, it wasn't until this season that I found an app to help me with the rest of the work.</p><p>It's early in the gardening season still — we're not even supposed to put things in the ground here until after Mother's Day — but this delightful combo of “robots + AI” has been a massive help in getting things started on time this year.</p>

<p>I first heard about Seedtime in March of this year, and it immediately caught my eye. It's a garden planner app that helps you understand when the plants you want need to be sown, planted, and ultimately harvested. All the calculations are done for you! All you have to do is follow the task list that's automatically created. I've got it running on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="B1051C ">BigMe B1051C color E Ink tablet</a>, which is perfect for using outdoors.</p><p>Seedtime has a massive database of garden plants, including all the vegetables and herbs you're likely to plant, no matter where you live. The app is free, but I've been using the premium subscription as part of the testing and review process.</p><p>Anyone starting out for the first time this year can stick with the free option, as it provides plenty of functionality and doesn't force you to pay for the basics. If you find you need some of the premium functionality, upgraded accounts start at around $4.55 per month.</p><p>You'll begin your Seedtime journey by giving your garden a name, selecting the region you live in, and then adding in all the crops you plan to plant this year. Seedtime automatically calculates the best time to seed your crops, prepare the beds, transplant plants that need it, and even start looking for things to harvest, all added neatly to the calendar in the app.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The scheduling feature is incredibly smart and will even reschedule tasks based on when you complete them.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>There's even a tasks section that makes it easy to understand what needs to be done <em>right now</em>. Even if you're late to a task — I was several weeks late planting a few crops — Seedtime will automatically catch up your tasks and recalculate when the next action needs to happen based on when you check tasks off your list.</p><p>This part of the app blew me away, as it completely cut out the guesswork often associated with when you need to plant/transplant/harvest, even if the back of the seed package gives you rough estimates. If nothing, it completely solves the daunting task of writing down everything you want to plant and trying to calculate when you need to do things.</p><p>Initially, I felt adding drops was overwhelming because there are so many sections you can fill in, but <strong>can</strong> is the operative word. Everything you need is filled in by default, so long as the app has a premade crop entry.</p><p>Of course, that means that Seedtime doesn't have entries for <em>everything</em> you might want to plant. While it has a million different types of tomatoes, herbs, carrots, and most other staples, you won't find entries for fruit trees or bushes just yet, although those may be added in the future.</p><p>You can manually add these things, and the basic seeding/transplant/harvest/etc sections will still automatically calculate things out for you, but it's a bit more manual work than crops that already have entries.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N8gjpjKqDpCk2K7pXXRmSe" name="seedtime-app-layout" alt="Creating a garden layout on the Seedtime app on a computer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8gjpjKqDpCk2K7pXXRmSe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you've got a list of crops selected, you can take those into the layout section of the app and create a full visual garden layout. This part of the experience only works on a web browser for now, although I had no issue opening it up in Chrome on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>. If the calendar portion of the app impressed you, the layout section is going to blow you away.</p><p>While Seedtime is working on more automated ways of creating layouts in the future, the process is still manual at this time. You'll drag out squares, rectangles, circles, or a number of other shapes and give them a name.</p><p>After your beds are in the layout, you can drag out each crop and position it where it belongs. It'll even show you the proper spacing, letting you iron out all the nitty-gritty details with very little effort.</p><p>This doesn't just give you a pretty garden layout, though; it also gives you a visual layout of all your calendar entries. A quick glance at the layout portion of the app will let you know what you need to do and <em>where</em> to do it, just in case you forgot where you planted those radishes. The combination of colored calendar entries and visual locations of garden plots is a game changer, and it's going to make the rest of my gardening season a breeze.</p>
<h2 id="ai-you-ll-actually-want-to-use-2">AI you'll actually want to use</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PSYDsfp2tEZtWf7wQsMSde" name="seedtime-app-ai-schedule" alt="Using AI in the Seedtime app to select the next best planting date for crops" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSYDsfp2tEZtWf7wQsMSde.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most recent update of Seedtime added an AI-powered companion planting section, giving you five immediate ideas of what to plant near all your favorite crops. This includes staples like marigolds, which can help ward off nematodes, and other companion plants like dill, which can be paired with cucumbers to enhance their flavor. Seeing these companion plants right on each crop’s tile is one of the most genius ways to integrate AI that I've seen yet, and it doesn't stop there.</p><p>Let's say you're adding a specific cultivar of broccoli that the app doesn't have, and you don't know when you need to plant it. On the “add crop” card, you can tap a little sparkly AI button to perform a calculation based on your crop type, cultivar, region you live in, and more. After a few seconds, the app will return a suggested date, plus make any other necessary changes to the crop’s card.</p><p>When Seedtime CEO Paul Dysinger told me about this feature during an interview, I was seriously impressed. A lot of AI-powered features on our devices are cool, but they're not always implemented in useful ways. While AI could always make a mistake and give you the wrong date, Seedtime lets you make a decision before implementing it and gives you other suggestions based on the response, which helps introduce a level of trust in the process.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>AI is built into the Seedtime app, giving you suggestions for what companion plants to plant and when to plant them based on what you want to grow and where you live.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>For now, AI functions are unlimited since this is a brand-new feature, but the company will implement a token system once the process has been finalized. Free users will get a few tokens to use for basic tasks, while paid users will have much wider use with the concept and more tokens included every month.</p><p>The new companion crop planting feature just launched last Tuesday, so a lot of this new AI-driven content is <em>very</em> fresh and shows that the company is adding features that are actually helpful, not just fluff.</p><p>When I asked Dysinger about the potential of adding crop rotation schedules and a few other features like it, he said they weren't out of the question and have been requested in the past. As far as features go, this was the only big one I could think of that would be extremely helpful for many gardeners when planning next year's garden.</p><p>I'm excited to see how Seedtime affects my gardening this year and if I end up being more productive because of it. My biggest problem every year is that I often get overwhelmed with the number of things that need to be done and often miss important dates because of it. Seedtime should fix that entirely, and hopefully it helps you out a lot, too!</p>

Performance on this phone is also close to some of the more premium-level Pixel phones, featuring the same Tensor chipset. It's also great for photography, as is much of the Pixel lineup, and Google promises seven years of updates, making for a great, future-proof device.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you're in the market for a brand new phone and have liked Pixel devices in the past; you want an extra $100 of Amazon cash; you value battery life, great cameras and/or a good-looking display in a smartphone.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want Google's latest AI features; you need a device with fast charging; having access to top-tier low-light photography is a priority for you.</p><p>Google's mid-range Pixel 9a easily ranks among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> released this year (so far), offering a beautiful 6.3-inch pOLED display, seven years of OS updates starting at Android 15, solid battery life, and a good suite of cameras.</p><p>This particular deal is for the 128GB configuration, though you can also upgrade to 256GB if you need more storage. Buyers also like this phone's overall performance, as backed by 8GB of RAM and the powerful Google Tensor G4 chipset.</p><p>It is worth noting that this phone won't include some of the Gemini AI features included on Google's premium Pixel phones, and low-light photographs don't hold up against the competition very well.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung’s new Tap to Transfer makes sending money as easy as a phone bump, and it's rolling out to the US later this month.</li><li>Debuted with the Galaxy S25, this feature is Samsung’s answer to Apple’s Tap to Cash, but more open and flexible.</li><li>It's backed by Visa and Mastercard, so you can send money using your debit card inside Samsung Wallet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Splitting the bill after dinner or concert tickets is always a pain. But Samsung just made things a whole lot easier with the new "Tap to Transfer" feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/what-is-samsung-digital-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a>.</p><p>Samsung first showed off its peer-to-peer payment method when it launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series earlier this year. It works a lot like Apple’s “Tap to Cash,” where iPhone users can just bump phones to send money.</p><p>But unlike Apple’s walled garden, Samsung’s version plays nice with a bunch of third-party digital wallets too.</p><p>Starting later this month in the U.S., users can send money to friends and family just by tapping their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> together.</p>
<h2 id="backed-by-visa-and-mastercard-2">Backed by Visa and Mastercard</h2>
<p>Samsung says it has teamed up with Visa and Mastercard to let users send funds using their debit card stored in Samsung Wallet. If the person you’re sending to also has their debit card set up in a digital wallet, the cash moves instantly with just one tap.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:141.43%;"><img id="QjMgNtKhdj8GkLpwT2Uz6M" name="Samsung-tap-to-transfer" alt="Two phones with Samsung Wallet bumped together" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QjMgNtKhdj8GkLpwT2Uz6M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="601" height="850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nonetheless, even if they don’t have a digital wallet, it still works — as long as they’ve got a physical debit card with tap-to-pay powers, Samsung Wallet can link up via the chip.</p><p>If you need to send money from a distance, you can just find your contact by their phone number and send cash their way, no matter where they are.</p><p>Samsung Wallet already lets you store everything from your driver’s license and student ID to that random coffee shop loyalty card you forgot existed. This new update turns it into an all-in-one life organizer and money mover.</p>
<h2 id="money-moves-in-minutes-2">Money moves in minutes</h2>
<p>And in case you’re wondering, the money shows up within minutes (depending on your bank).</p><p>It's worth pointing out that Tap to Transfer isn’t locked into Samsung's ecosystem. It’ll also work with a bunch of third-party digital wallets. That’s because it taps into your existing accounts and debit cards, not just Samsung’s own setup.</p><p>Of course, there might be some limits or fees depending on your bank, and not every card will play nice from day one. But for Galaxy users, this could mean the end of payment app hopping.</p>

<hr>
<p>Oura <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/introducing-metabolic-health/">announced</a> on Tuesday (May 6) that it is launching two new features to its existing AI-powered lineup designed to help users in the U.S. track their overall metabolic health. Oura has developed a way to track users' blood glucose levels by integrating data from a secondary device directly into the Oura app.</p><p>The ring maker has partnered with Dexcom, an American healthcare company that manufactures glucose biosensors to help users gain insights into their blood-glucose levels during the day.</p><p>This feature can be accessed when users purchase or already own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.stelo.com/">Stelo</a>, a small FDA-approved biosensor worn on the back of the upper arm, which leverages Dexcom’s most accurate glucose technology and reveals how lifestyle factors can affect glucose.</p><p>Members who integrate Stelo with Oura will see their daily glucose readings throughout the day, and also gain insights as to how nutrition, stress, movement, and sleep also have a role to play when it comes to balancing their blood-glucose levels.</p>

<p>Much like other health parameters, this feature will show users contextual graphs on a new "Glucose screen" and insights from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-rolls-out-its-ai-powered-personal-trainer">Oura Advisor</a> to help them understand glucose levels throughout the day. This way, they can tailor their lifestyle habits to help them maintain or "achieve optimal glucose balance"</p><p>When tracking blood glucose levels, users need to understand a key metric, called “Time Above Range,” which is the time spent above their target glucose range. The Oura app uses AI to analyze this metric and showcases glucose trends for that particular day, based on the user's lifestyle.</p><p>"Meal-induced glucose spikes can vary significantly due to factors like sleep, stress, exercise, and meal timing," said Shyamal Patel, senior vice president of science at Oura.</p><p>And with this feature, the company aims to help users experiment and discover lifestyle habits that impact their glucose levels rather than solely relying on foods that spike it.</p><p>"With this approach, members can maintain a healthy relationship with food while building long-term habits that support metabolic health," Patel added.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the company is launching a seamless method for users to log their meals. Unlike other apps that require manually inputting each food item to track calorie consumption, with the "Meals" feature, Oura's App will analyze an entire plate simply by using a picture. "After several months of testing in Oura Labs, Meals will now be a permanent feature in the Oura App," the company stated.</p><p>Steering away from traditional calorific intake insights,  Meals focuses on macronutrients. As seen below, once users click a picture of their plates, the feature breaks things down for them. Showing each "Meal Item" and the nutrients their plate contains.</p><p>Showcasing elements like protein, fiber, processing level, added sugars, total fats, and total carbs to give users an at-a-glance summary. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-rolls-out-its-ai-powered-personal-trainer">Oura's AI-powered Advisor</a> also comes into play, which helps users understand their plate better, personalized "non-judgmental" tips about their meals.</p>

The Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X is aimed at those looking to switch to SSDs as the default medium of storage, and the all-flash NAS comes with six M.2 slots and 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity.</p><p>There are decent choices in this category now, and having <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">tested TerraMaster's F8 SSD Plus</a> last year, I was keen on seeing what ASUSTOR brings to the table. The brand is doing much better with its software efforts, and its mobile clients are in a decent state.</p><p>If you're ready to switch to SSD storage and want a powerful home server, this is what you're getting with the FS6806X.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4dTPWpjRHpCAKr5wsFDVQY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4dTPWpjRHpCAKr5wsFDVQY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUSTOR unveiled the Flashstor 6 Gen2 in November 2024, and the NAS is now available globally. The FS6806X model I'm testing has six M.2 slots and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-FLASHSTOR-FS6806X-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0DKJG5QXS">retails for $999 on Amazon</a>, and ASUSTOR also has a 12-drive model dubbed the Flashstor 12 Pro Gen2 FS6812X <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-FLASHSTOR-FS6806X-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0DKJJD94W">that costs $1,399</a>.</p><p>In my view, the 6-bay FD6806X should be more than adequate, considering you can add traditional HDD bays if you need to via USB 4. Like the brand's other NAS systems, you get a standard three-year warranty with either model.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-asustor-flashstor-6-gen2-fs6806x-design"><span>ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jS4u8dJuBsgBatnvgqfPPY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jS4u8dJuBsgBatnvgqfPPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key benefit of an all-flash NAS is that it is considerably smaller than a traditional home server as it doesn't need to accommodate 3.5-inch drive bays. ASUSTOR went with a horizontal design for the FS6806X, and the NAS reminds me of ASUS routers; the angular design is characteristic of the brand, and it looks cool.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CkYYZtKbWTTWm2HFWTBUPY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkYYZtKbWTTWm2HFWTBUPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, it is bigger than the F8 SSD Plus while not providing as many SSD slots. You get six M.2 slots on the underside, and I can't help but feel that ASUSTOR could have done a better job with the sizing of the NAS. Then there's the location of the buttons; I'll admit that it took me an embarrassingly long time to locate the power button (it's located on the right).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XD9k5HLoXyXpmWaCzfSuMY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XD9k5HLoXyXpmWaCzfSuMY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The button glows (obviously), and other than that, you just get the usual status indicators. There's a dual-tone design with a brushed metal effect, but the chassis itself is made out of plastic. The build quality isn't the best; there's a noticeable flex to the chassis, and it doesn't quite have the same sturdiness as other NAS models I tested.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uvsCmQP9FFybvVDpqPwwSY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvsCmQP9FFybvVDpqPwwSY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are other issues with the design, particularly with the M.2 drive bay; while most NAS systems use a traditional screw to secure the SSD after it's installed, ASUSTOR went with a plastic backing system that just doesn't measure up. I broke two mounts just by pulling back after installing SSDs, and it is annoying. There's a reason every other SSD NAS in this category uses screws to mount NVMe drives, and I don't know why ASUSTOR decided to innovate in this area.</p><p>Thankfully, the brand nailed the thermal management, and the addition of a fan over the SSD slots ensures the drives don't overheat. I believe the design needs an overhaul, and ASUSTOR needs to do better with the build quality in general.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-asustor-flashstor-6-gen2-fs6806x-ports-and-connectivity"><span>ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X: Ports and connectivity</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9jnUjEBtqeTBAahxKdDJZY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jnUjEBtqeTBAahxKdDJZY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FS6806X doesn't have any shortcomings when it comes to connectivity; the NAS has 10 Gigabit Ethernet as standard, and it has dual USB-C connectors based on USB 4 ports alongside two USB-A ports that use the3.2 Gen2x1 standard. You even get a USB-A up front, and it's convenient to back up external drives using the connector.</p>

<p>The NAS is powered by a 2.3GHz quad-core AMD Ryzen V3C14 platform, and it isn't short on power. If anything, it is one of the better choices in this category, and the only issue I have with ASUSTOR going with AMD is that there's no hardware transcoding, so you miss out on that ability. If you're using Plex and need transcodes, you'll need to get an Intel-based model instead, such as the F8 SSD Plus.</p><p>Other than that, you get 8GB of RAM installed out of the box, and as it uses regular SO-DIMM slots, you can switch out memory modules, with the NAS accommodating up to 64GB.</p>

<p>Setting up the FS6806X is easy; just slot in the drives, and you'll be able to configure ADM, the brand's software. ASUSTOR did a much better job in this area in the last two years, and ADM has a decent interface with plenty of great utilities. I was able to set up Plex and Tailscale without any issues, and install the usual slate of services I use on with every NAS.</p><p>I slotted in WD SN770 drives and connected the NAS to my 10GbE network, and it did a fantastic job. It held its own against the F8 SSD Plus in this area, and while there was an issue transferring a 240GB volume of data once, I didn't see any problems after starting over.</p><p>The NAS does a good job as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">Plex server</a>; the native client doesn't have any problems as such, but you don't get hardware transcoding. Outside of that, the FS6806X handles the usual tasks without any issues; backing up photos and videos, accessing data outside the house, and generally using the drive as a media streaming device proved to be hassle-free.</p>

<p>I still think the F8 SSD Plus is the best all-flash NAS around; it doesn't cost as much as the FS6806X, and you get eight SSD slots alongside the same 10GbE connectivity. There's plenty to like with the software as well, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F8-SSD-Plus-NAS/dp/B0D9HWLDX5">coming in at $799</a>, the NAS is a good value.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a powerful all-flash NAS</li><li>You want 10GbE connectivity</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want hardware transcoding in Plex</li><li>You need the best value</li></ul>
<p>With SSDs getting affordable, it's not that difficult to set up an all-flash NAS, and the FS6806X has the basics covered. While I'm not a fan of the design, the NAS has good thermal management, and that's what ultimately matters in an SSD enclosure. With 10GbE and USB 4, there are no issues with connectivity either.</p><p>ASUSTOR is making positive strides with its software, and while there are still a few rough edges, it's in a much better position than previous years. Ultimately, there isn't anything wrong with the FS6806X as such, but it isn't quite as good a value as the F8 SSD Plus. The FS6806X gets a recommendation because of the hardware and connectivity, and if you want to maximize value, just know that there are other choices available.</p>

<p>There is <em>a lot</em> to like about the EarFun OpenJump open-ear earbuds! They are one of the least expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds" target="_blank">open-ear products</a> and compete with more expensive options, like the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear Open</a>.</p><p>Let’s talk hardware and features first. Unboxing the EarFun OpenJump, you’ll find the earbuds case with the earbuds inside. Below the tray the case sits in, you’ll find the usual paperwork and a short charge cable. There are no ear tips because this is, after all, an open-ear affair.</p><p>Though not as large as some, the case will dominate a pocket despite being very light and not feeling particularly reassuring regarding its build quality. That said, it doesn’t creak, and the hinges don’t have any lateral give, making the “plasticky” feel a bit deceptive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VPDHPhBp8JQQZGaFSq7RLS" name="earfun-openjump-case-charging.JPG" alt="EarFun OpenJump case, showing the USB-C charging port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VPDHPhBp8JQQZGaFSq7RLS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this price point, you do get a well-spec’d clamshell case. It comes with USB-C charging and Qi wireless charging support, which is something even more expensive offerings don’t have. There is a pairing button inside the case, and a status LED on the front face of the case, just below the opening. EarFun says you’ll get a total of 42 hours of additional charging out of it.</p><p>After examining the case, it was time to set up and pair the EarFun OpenJump. When I first opened the app, I was notified that a firmware update was available. Once that was done, my review began in earnest.</p><p>Listening to the EarFun OpenJump in its default setting is enjoyable, but the experience comes alive when you customize the sound to your hearing, with a caveat. We’ll get to that in a moment.</p>

<p>I’ve worn these all day at my day job, and I have to say that they are <em>quite</em> comfortable! They don’t have the adjustability of the AeroFit 2 that I just reviewed, and they aren’t as large as the Nothing Ear Open, but they are tiny, light, and for my ears, a great fit. Depending on the size and shape of your ears, your mileage may vary, though.</p><p>I’ve found them for as cheap as $60, and at that price, they have <em>a lot</em> to offer in the sound quality department. I went back to some of my favorite open-ear TWS earbuds that I’ve reviewed over the last year and performed some A/B testing. They are competitive with open earbuds that cost much more. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/soundcore-aerofit-2-review">Soundcore AeroFit 2</a>, the Nothing Ear Open, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open</a> all fare a bit better when it comes to clarity in the mids and sparkle in the high frequencies.</p><p>Given the cost difference, even with the sub-$100 AeroFit 2, that difference is expected. That said, if cost is your primary concern, the sound signature of the OpenJump is nothing to sneeze at.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="pZF9SgojNbWdAj4zUvC6cT" name="earfun-openjump-app-settings.JPG" alt="EarFun OpenJump EaarFun audio Android app, showing the settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pZF9SgojNbWdAj4zUvC6cT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I tested the OpenJump with LDAC activated. Doing so deactivates multipoint functionality, but it's worth it to increase the dynamic range. Having tested quite a few open earbuds, in my opinion, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained" target="_blank">HiRes Wireless Audio support</a> makes a difference in the listening experience.</p><p>As with all open-ear earbuds, in the silence of a quiet room, the sound signature is much different than when you’re out on the streets or at a beach. In a quiet room, the EarFun OpenJump sound very good. The highs, lows, and mids are all well represented with my custom EQ profile.</p><p>While my custom profile is great in quiet rooms or out on the streets with busy metropolitan life buzzing around me, the <strong>Bass Boost 1</strong> preset gave me an enjoyable representation of all the frequencies despite competing audio from passing cars and other urban jungle sounds. Most importantly, playing at the lower volumes that you’ll want to listen to open-ear products, I still had solid sounds pumping into my ears.</p>

<p>Battery life is excellent with the EarFun OpenJump. Playing a Tidal LoFi stream at about 55% of maximum volume from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> with LDAC activated in the app, I saw about 10 hours of battery life. EarFun advertises 11 hours, and those estimates are usually under “ideal conditions,” so having a high-quality codec activated, which drains battery faster, makes that an excellent showing.</p><p>Why didn’t I test them at max volume? That isn’t a realistic use case for open-ears. The whole point is to have your volume mixed with ambient sound at a level where the ambient sound is not only audible but also discernible — enabling you to hear cars or people coming up from behind you, for example.</p>
<h2 id="room-for-improvement-2">Room for improvement</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="3tJAvSvQeLYPbaFuoMDtLS" name="earfun-openjump-more-buds-in-hand.JPG" alt="EarFun OpenJump showing touch control surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tJAvSvQeLYPbaFuoMDtLS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some things you should know if you’re seriously looking at the OpenJump. At full price, or on sale, there are some tradeoffs. They aren’t deal breakers, just things you should be aware of.</p><p>The Spatial Audio feature, <strong>Theater Mode</strong><em>,</em> is not effective in creating a larger soundstage with quality sound. It also overemphasizes mids and highs to the detriment of the music or video content you're listening to. Music sounds better with it deactivated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4XodMc8YsatCJx6S2tXokc" name="earfun-openjump-angled-touch-surface" alt="Image of the EarFun OpenJump being worn by Tshaka, showing the touch control surface positioning on his ear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4XodMc8YsatCJx6S2tXokc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The touch controls could be better implemented. The part of the earbud that sits over your ear and houses the speakers is angled, making it a bit awkward to tap the controls. In the couple of weeks I've had the earbuds, those controls are still problematic for me. Part of that is the diminutive size of the touch surface.</p><p>All is not lost, though. You can customize the controls, adding or removing features to make them work for your situation.</p>

<p>The EarFun OpenJump competes with Soundcore AeroFit 2 (more expensive) and Baseus Eli Sport 1 (cheaper). Outside the US, Honor and Huawei are also competitors. While I haven’t tested some of those, Harish Jonnalagadda's reviews of the Baseus Eli Sport 1 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/honor-earbuds-open-review" target="_blank">Honor Earbuds Open</a> are positive.</p><p>The most significant difference here is that EarFun has significantly better battery life. Given this, and the OpenJump's good sound quality, it may have the edge over the Eli Sport 1 and Earbuds Open.</p>

<p>At the sale price of $60, these are the budget open-ear earbuds to beat in the States! At their suggested retail price of $80, they’re still a compelling option compared to earbuds priced at $100 or more.</p><p>For their fit, their sound quality, HiRes Wireless Audio support, wireless charging support, and battery life, the EarFun OpenJump are easy to recommend for those looking for open-ear TWS earbuds.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is gearing up to reveal Material 3 Expressive at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-i-o-2025-prepares-sessions-list-android-xr-ai">I/O 2025</a> later this month, but it accidentally shared its research and design process for the user-interface design shift ahead of time. A blog post published early, captured by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250501004611/https://design.google/library/expressive-material-design-google-research" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>, gives us a sneak peek at the future of Android design, and why it's getting more "expressive" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/05/material-3-expressive-leak/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The conversation started in 2022, when a Google research intern questioned why Material Design apps all started looking the same, and "boring." That led to 46 individual studies with over 18,000 total participants over three years, all trying to figure out how Material Design in Google apps could be improved. In the end, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-ui-icons-panel-redesign-leak">Material 3 Expressive</a> is "both beautiful and highly usable," per the company.</p><p>"Material 3 Expressive principles are rooted in solid research and built on longstanding usability best practices, so designers can confidently use these new components and principles, knowing they're building something that will be easy to use and that people can connect with," the blog post explains.</p>
<h2 id="google-says-expressive-designs-are-cool-2">Google says expressive designs are cool</h2>
<p>Google's blog post reveals that its studies found that Material 3 Expressive design resulted in a higher perception of "brand coolness." The company claims that the coolness factor has a direct correlation to behavioral intent. In other words, Google thinks a "cool" Material 3 Expressive could push users to switch to Android.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of Google's other findings about Material 3 Expressive:</p>
<ul><li>Google found a <strong>32% increase in subculture perception</strong>, "which indicates that expressive design makes a brand feel more relevant and 'in-the-know.'"</li><li>The company's research also showed a <strong>34% increase in modernity</strong>, "making a brand feel fresh and forward-thinking."</li><li>The studies also pointed to a <strong>30% increase in rebelliousness</strong>, "suggesting that expressive design positions a brand as a bold and innovative leader, willing to break from convention."</li></ul>

<p>The company's research studies for Material 3 Expressive included the following focus areas:</p>
<ul><li>Eye tracking: Analyzing where users focused their attention</li><li>Surveys and focus groups: Gauging emotional responses to different designs</li><li>Experiments: Gathering sentiment and preferences</li><li>Usability: Seeing how quickly participants could understand and use an interface</li></ul>
<p>Google's blog post directly compares Material 3 Expressive to Apple's iOS Human Interface Guidelines. "We have found that well-applied expressive design is strongly preferred by people of all ages over non-expressive design that followed the iOS Human Interface Guidelines, with that preference being particularly strong—up to 87%—among 18-24 year olds," the company writes.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-changing-in-material-3-expressive-2">What's changing in Material 3 Expressive?</h2>
<p>The early Material 3 Expressive blog post shows many examples of how the design language can be used, but it isn't necessarily indicative of the exact changes we'll see in future Android updates. A few design elements we can expect to see appear later on are floating toolbars and accent coloring that make "key actions stand out."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.40%;"><img id="dW4DvztadByqyYfNpSzsXB" name="Material-3-Expressive-leak-11.jpeg" alt="The leaked Material 3 Expressive design images." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dW4DvztadByqyYfNpSzsXB.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1148" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the Material 3 Expressive elements were designed with accessibility in mind, as the design guidelines exceed the minimum standards for tap target size and color contrast. The team also made sure to make the design language feel premium while remaining "expressive."</p><p>If you'd like a glimpse of how Material 3 Expressive will directly impact Android's UI and UX, there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/androids-leaked-battery-status-indicator-bears-a-striking-resemblance-to-ios">a leaked version of the new battery status indicator</a> that serves as a neat preview.</p>
<h2 id="google-s-material-3-expressive-tips-for-app-developers-2">Google's Material 3 Expressive tips for app developers </h2>
<p>The company concludes its blog post by warning developers that expressive design is not "a one-size-fits-all solution." While it works in some situations, it might not be the best choice in others. Google gives the example of how Material 3 Expressive is great for a music app, but not a banking app. In the end, Google says designers need to "respect well-established UI patterns and standards."</p><p>Here is a full list of tips provided by Google to product designers:</p>

<ul><li>YouTube is rolling out a special subscription tier just for select users in  India, France, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.</li><li>With this tier, users can share their premium subscription with one other person in their household.</li><li>This move is set to increase the adoptability of the otherwise expensive Premium tier.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube seems to be finding new ways to increase its premium subscribers. According to a new report, it looks like the streaming platform has piloted a new subscription tier in India, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. This allows users to share their premium subscription with another household member, as opposed to having two subscriptions in the same house. (first reported by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/youtube-pilots-two-person-premium-plan-to-boost-its-subscription-push-article-13012813.html#google_vignette"> MoneyControl</a>)</p><p>According to the publication, the two-person Premium subscription tier is being offered in India at a monthly cost of Rs 219, while the Music Premium subscription tier is available at Rs 149 per month during the pilot.</p><p>The prerequisites for this are that the two people sharing this subscription should be  13 years or older, have a working Google account, and most importantly, they should be a part of the same Google family group (Google lets you create a virtual family group to share services).</p><p>However, it will only allow two people to share the YouTube premium subscription as opposed to everyone else in that group.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UghHxcSsxqYZ8eNYBdqQc" name="YT- Premium-subscription-for -two" alt="YT Premium subscription for two people pilots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UghHxcSsxqYZ8eNYBdqQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Money Control)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube told the publication that it is "experimenting with new ways to provide greater flexibility and value to our YouTube Premium subscribers, including offering a two-person Premium plan option, allowing two people to share a subscription at a reduced cost.”</p><p>This move could make it feasible for more people to adopt the premium subscription, specifically between couples, roommates, or family members in the same house, instead of paying for the same subscription twice, which comes up to Rs 298 (149 *2). That would cost almost the same price as YouTube Premium's Family Plan, where six people get to share the subscription for Rs 299.</p>

<p>YouTube Premium has seen a steady price increase over the last two years in many countries across the world. India was also one of the markets that was hit by hike in prices. Rates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-increases-prices-of-youtube-premium-plans-in-india-here-are-new-prices-vs-old-and-the-plan-that-has-seen-maximum-hike/articleshow/112832224.cms">went up </a>anywhere between 12-60% based on the tire you've subscribed to.</p><p>During the most recent earnings call, Alphabet reported record first-quarter earnings, attributing some of it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtubes-affordable-ad-free-premium-lite-officially-rolls-out">YouTube's </a>advertising, which brought in $8.93 billion. "Through all this growth, subscriptions are now a big part of the business. We continue to diversify subscription options," CEO Sundar Pichai said during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/alphabets-q1-earnings-exceeded-expectations-with-a-12-percent-increase-in-overall-revenue">earnings call</a>.</p><p>It remains unclear if this tier will expand to other countries across the globe, considering it would be beneficial and frugal for many with multiple streaming subscriptions. Android Central has reached out to Google about this and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p><em><strong>Jaqueline asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I know a bit about Auracast but I'm not sure how it will work when it arrives in Android 16. I understand I can tune into broadcasts, but can I create one? My husband and I would like to share a podcast on our daily walk, but he wears hearing aids and I do not. Will there be a way to broadcast to his aids while listening on my own Pixel buds at the same time?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Jaqueline and thanks for the question, as well as the kind and encouraging words that came with it. Please accept this virtual internet hug of appreciation.</p><p>And this happens to be a great question. It's about something new and potentially really cool, but also very specific concerning the feature itself. When they tell us all the wild things something new can do, companies never talk about any real use cases. So we're gonna :)</p>

<p>First, the good news: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/bluetooth-auracast-broadcast-audio-announcement">Auracast</a> is able to do exactly what you want. You are able to create a password-protected broadcast of audio from your phone that any compatible equipment can connect to, so you can play your podcast and listen through your buds while your husband connects with his hearing aids.</p><p>In fact, Samsung told me its compatible phones can do this right now since they have incorporated Auracast already and pointed me to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10001042/" target="_blank">article it has already written</a> that details the process. Without the right hardware here, I can't test it for myself. I believe them, though, because this is exactly the type of thing Auracast was advertised as able to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ibubzYBf4UEb2UWKjF2u4h" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-2-Pro-Auracast-menu-IFA-2024.jpg" alt="The Bluetooth menu for the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro with Auracast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ibubzYBf4UEb2UWKjF2u4h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You knew this part was coming, but that doesn't mean it will work that way everywhere.</p><p>Auracast is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth LE</a> feature and has a set of complete specifications, meaning it should work universally no matter what hardware you are using. If it's compatible, it should be 100% compatible. That never happens in the real world.</p><p>In fact, Bluetooth is a great example of how "standards" are already seemingly random, and the version number and the equipment manufacturer mean more than anything it says on the box. Ask anyone with two different brands of phone and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-automotive-15-features-detailed">Bluetooth infotainment system</a> from a car maker all about it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pfCwgAvrXh4Wf8PcVddieN" name="ReSound-Nexia-Hearing-Aids.jpg" alt="Auracast-enabled hearings aids" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pfCwgAvrXh4Wf8PcVddieN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would not be surprised if things didn't work the way we expected or were told they would, especially at first. Normally, that's not a big deal as long as we get some sort of functionality, but in this case, you might be buying new hearing aids and making sure your phone is advertised as capable, so it could get a little pricey.</p><p>No amount of money is too much to spend if it makes you and your husband happy or have a better life, but if it was supposed to and doesn't, that's a bitter pill to swallow.</p><p>I hate suggesting this, but I am going to anyway — wait. Let the feature arrive on more devices and somebody will test it to make sure it works the way we expected it to work. Look at your favorite tech websites and audio/Hi-fi websites until someone tries it. If it works, you'll even know what hardware it works with.</p>

<p>I'm very interested in the accessibility aspect of Auracast myself, so I'm in the same boat. Listening in a crowded bar or to a sports announcer seems pretty cool, but to me, the best part of the tech is its (hopefully) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hearingassociatesmc.com/blog/what-is-auracast">better functionality with hearing aids</a>. If I can source the things I need, I'll be sure to give it a load of testing myself and would definitely share any and all experiences.</p><p>In the meantime, I'm holding on to a few dollars until I know it will work the way I want it to work with the things I spend my own money on. If you do check it out, please drop me a line and let me know how it went!</p>

<ul><li>Google is planning an overhaul of Android's user-interface design with Material 3 Expressive.</li><li>We have an early look at how Android's battery status indicator will change to become more like iOS as part of the future update.</li><li>The company will officially share more about the upcoming changes at Google I/O 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google confirmed it will reveal a "next-level" user-interface and user-experience design at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-i-o-2025-prepares-sessions-list-android-xr-ai">Google I/O 2025</a>, called Material 3 Expressive. Ahead of that expected launch, numerous leaks and APK teardowns are r<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-ui-icons-panel-redesign-leak">evealing key elements of Material 3 Expressive</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/mysticleaks/104" target="_blank">Mystic Leaks on Telegram</a> recently shared a preview of the redesigned Clock app, and it is now giving us a look at Android's new battery status indicator (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-new-battery-icon-up-close-look/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>For the most part, Android's new battery status indicator is a horizontal battery icon with black numerical text showing the current percentage. However, it'll change based on the charge state. The colors pop more than the existing battery indicator, filling up the portion of the battery icon that's remaining in charge.</p><p>You'll see a green icon when your phone is charging, a yellow icon when battery saver is active, and a red icon when your phone has low power. A lightning bolt will appear beside the status indicator when an Android device is charging, and a plus sign indicates battery saver is turned on.</p><p>You can see the various iterations of the new Android battery status indicator in the screenshots below, as revealed by Mystic Leaks:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.36%;"><img id="EBLCDyYNikikBPxBNeiMNi" name="Android-16-Battery-Icon-Leaked" alt="The variations of the new Android battery icon." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EBLCDyYNikikBPxBNeiMNi.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1660" height="504" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If it wasn't obvious already, Android's upcoming battery status indicator seems to take more than a few cues from iOS. The horizontal, color-coded battery icons with bolded percentage information have been a staple of Apple's mobile operating system for some time now. Based on the screenshots above, Google's variant appears to feature larger, bolder text.</p><p>It features black percentage text within the icon, whereas Apple's icon shifts between white and black text based on the current background. If you're using a dark background on iOS, you'll see a white battery icon and black text, and vice versa. It's currently unclear whether Android's new battery status indicator will work the same way.</p><p>We don't know when Google's planned Material 3 Expressive design changes will roll out. The company has a session regarding the changes set for Google I/O 2025, so it's expected we'll learn more there, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-teases-a-special-i-o-edition-of-the-android-show">at The Android Show beforehand</a>.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">how to watch Google I/O 2025</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-make-the-most-sense-out-of-google-io">how much you should care</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Roku users looking to enjoy Andor Season 2 aren't having a great time, as reports fly off the shelves.</p><p>Over the past few days, Roku owners have taken to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/td-p/1071118/highlight/true">official forums</a> to report issues when streaming Disney Plus using the company's products (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660950/roku-hdr-issues-washed-out-colors-gray">The Verge</a>). A main thread for reports was created by a Roku moderator to gather information. Users quickly chimed in, stating that, while watching Disney Plus, the colors in the content appear "washed out." One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/td-p/1071118/highlight/true#:~:text=a%20week%20ago-,Disney%2B%20Colors%20Washed%20out%20after%20recent%20update,-Hello%2C">user states</a> they own a TCL model 65S405 and their colors are "bright/washed out."</p><p>The user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/td-p/1071118/highlight/true#:~:text=a%20week%20ago-,Re%3A%20Disney%2B%20Colors%20Washed%20out%20after%20recent%20update,-My%20issue%20sounds">goes in-depth</a>, stating they're encountering these issues while watching content in 4K/HDR resolution. The post states that tinkering with HDR's settings only provides a minimal (positive) difference, but the Disney Plus content still appears washed out or extremely bright. Moreover, these issues seem to extend to YouTube videos, but aren't "nearly as bad."</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/td-p/1071118/highlight/true/page/2#:~:text=Tuesday-,Re%3A%20Disney%2B%20Colors%20Washed%20out%20after%20recent%20update,-Having%20same%20exact">report claims</a> to have encountered issues with Roku's streaming device on Amazon Prime, as well as Disney Plus. This user states problems disappear when streaming at HD quality.</p><p>One thing in common that all of these reports share is <em>when </em>the problems occurred: right after Roku's v14.5 software update. The problems appear quite closely connected, considering the sheer number of reports citing the same version and issue across several video streaming apps. The Roku moderator said the company is investigating, so hopefully, a resolution will arrive sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>The Verge dug deeper, and discovered that while the bulk of user reports concerned TCL TVs, there were a few that involved Hisense devices.</p><p>Strangely, these reports report severe issues with the streaming quality/experience of Roku's devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.roku.com/article/228844467">following v14.5</a>. The update, which rolled out in April, didn't focus on streaming "quality," per its patch notes. Roku cited bug fixes, security improvements, and the like. However, it did note the addition of "performance optimizations." There's a chance there's some conflict going on between the previously mentioned TVs and the latest OS.</p><p>Roku was also on our minds recently, as users started noticing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku/rokus-autoplay-ads-on-startup-are-rubbing-users-the-wrong-way">autoplay ads on startup</a>. The experiment involves displaying ads to users before they're able to reach the stick's true home screen. Regardless, users haven't reacted too kindly to seeing these ads while trying to relax with their shows or movies. Users reported the ads are "unskippable," but Roku claims there is a way to close them.</p><p>Another report tested this theory and concluded that the option to jump past these ads wasn't available. Users on Reddit added they were stuck watching movie trailers, unable to get to the content they truly desire.</p>

<ul><li>Google's code seemingly points toward a new security feature called "Intrusion Detection," which could debut in Android 16.</li><li>The feature, if granted permission, would let your device log encrypted entries about key device information to help you identify suspicious activity.</li><li>Android 16 Beta 4 arrived for testers in mid-April, as Google prepares for its expected May launch of the software.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A report claims Google is working on a new security feature for Android 16 that keeps your finger on the pulse of suspicious activity.</p><p>Surprisingly, the discovery was made in a recent Google Play Services app beta by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-intrusion-detection-3550583/">Android Authority</a>, and not in Android 16's Beta. This feature, known in the code as "Intrusion Detection," could be part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-expanding-passkeys-to-its-advanced-protection-program-as-us-election-nears">Advanced Protection</a>. Alongside tipster AssembleDebug, the publication discovered the feature will contain its own "Log Collection" and store key details about several aspects of your device.</p><p>Specifically, Intrusion Detection will log information about your browsing history, app installs, saved Bluetooth connections, lock screen credentials, and Wi-Fi.</p><p>A user's Google account comes into play here as the early surfaced code suggests all of these important details will be stored there. What's more, findings suggest the logs will be placed within a "private and encrypted" Google Drive, which only you (the owner) can get into.</p><p>Google's code adds the information it stores "can be used for forensic analysis in case of suspicious activity."</p>

<p>On the surface, this feature seems like a useful addition for users looking to keep an extra close eye on their data. The tipster discovered that, as you'd expect, users have to enable this feature by granting permission to store their data. On the other hand, Intrusion Detection <em>feels </em>like an extension of Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-expanding-passkeys-to-its-advanced-protection-program-as-us-election-nears">Advanced Protection Program</a>. The purpose of the program is to bring extra, fortified security for users to protect their account information.</p><p>Advanced Protection can not only help users avoid malicious downloads, but the company introduced passkey support for sign-ins to the program. This is a part of Google's efforts to move users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-m108-passkey-support">away from passwords to passkeys</a>, which require biometric credentials.</p><p>The program was also designed to help users who are more "at risk" for cybersecurity attacks, like campaign workers, journalists, human rights activists, and more.</p><p>The publication states this isn't the first time its observed Intrusion Detection in Google's code, but it has seemingly progressed since then. Still, there's no telling if we'll see this during Android 16's arrival or after. Speaking of, the company dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-drops-android-16-beta-4-before-the-big-stable-launch-in-may">Android 16 Beta 4</a> for testers in mid-April. The update cleaned up some loose ends as Google prepares for its Q2 2025 launch, which might happen this month.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung might surprise us with a faster-than-expected One UI 8 beta launch, possibly as soon as June.</li><li>One UI 8 isn’t expected to bring big new features like One UI 7 but will likely focus on improving and refining what’s already there.</li><li>Leaks point to a July or August 2025 release window, which lines up with Samsung's foldable launch plans.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Even though Samsung has been pretty quiet about what's next for One UI, some early information hints that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-bring-one-ui-8-sooner">things might be moving faster than usual behind the scenes</a>. Word on the street is we could see the beta version of One UI 8 drop as early as June this year, which would be a solid head start compared to the previous rollout.</p><p>This scoop comes from Tarun Vats on X. According to the leaker, Samsung might be shaking things up this year, with a testing schedule for One UI 8 that veers off from how the company handled things with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-one-ui-8-june-launch/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Galaxy Fam!!Hearing from sources that Samsung might launch the One UI 8 Beta as early as June!But as always — take it with a grain of salt. Samsung’s update timelines can shift anytime! pic.twitter.com/s0URGAJMwv<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1918632520632901992">May 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Samsung has built a solid reputation for being on point with software updates, rarely missing a beat. But the One UI 7 rollout threw folks off a bit, as it came in slower than expected. Still, looking at its history, it feels more like a random blip than a sign of a bigger shift in how Samsung does things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UBfByb7JCLTyZoeu3ywnWT" name="Android-16-logo-purple-Honor-200" alt="A purple and green Android 16 logo on an Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UBfByb7JCLTyZoeu3ywnWT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that Android 15 is officially landing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy devices</a>, all eyes are naturally turning to One UI 8. Samsung potentially kicking off as early as next month would be a pretty quick turnaround.</p><p>Still, Vats urges folks not to get too locked into that date just yet. Samsung’s timelines tend to shift depending on how things shape up during development, so it’s all still a bit up in the air.</p><p>If the June beta launch actually happens, Vats thinks there’s a good chance the stable One UI 8 (powered by Android 16) could land as early as August or September. That’d be a way tighter rollout than what we saw with One UI 7.</p>
<h2 id="no-major-overhauls-this-time-2">No major overhauls this time</h2>
<p>It’s also worth pointing out that One UI 7 was a pretty major leap for Samsung, packed with big changes. One UI 8, on the other hand, is expected to be focused on polishing things up rather than introducing a bunch of flashy new features.</p><p>Leaked details from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">internal tests</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> point to a release window around July or August 2025. This timing lines up with the expected launch of Samsung's next-gen foldables.</p>

<ul><li>Google's AI Mode is rumored to receive a new "Live for AI Mode" feature following newly spotted code.</li><li>The feature seems to leverage Google Lens quite heavily, and could provide a more vocal or conversational experience with AI Mode like Gemini Live.</li><li>A few days ago, Google's AI Mode opened to all Labs testers in the U.S. and adds visual cards for products and places.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google isn't slowing down the development of its latest AI feature, as a newly spotted mode could help take things further.</p><p>AI Mode for Search is Google's latest focus, and a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/05/google-ai-mode-live-lens-teardown/">9to5Google</a> suggests there's a little more on the way for mobile. The publication's Google app teardown reportedly contains code about a "Live for AI Mode" feature in the works. Supposedly, early code leads speculation to believe it'll function similarly to Gemini Live. Aside from the "Live" tag in the code, there is a button to "End Session" and mute your microphone.</p><p>A description within the code states this "Live" feature lets users "have a real-time voice conversation with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode</a> to find exactly what you’re looking for."</p><p>Other than these similarities, the post states "Live for AI Mode" will primarily piggyback off the mode's Google Lens integration. Many of the code strings begin with "lens_live," furthering this report. So, it seems users can bring an item or place within Google Lens' view and "start speaking to search." Additionally, users may be able to interrupt the AI to offer more information or to guide it in a new direction.</p><p>However, this feature seems to have a small limitation: an inability to ask follow-up questions. If the AI understands a would-be question as a follow-up, it'll be treated as a brand new question for a whole new search.</p>

<p>As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/07/google-ai-mode-lens/">publication notes</a>, Google rolled out its Lens integration for AI Mode in early April. The feature worked like Lens in other places, where users can take a snapshot and then speak their query for a search. However, what we're seeing rumored now is a little more flexible and intuitive, as users can have a more conversational experience with the mode. What's more, during that same time, Google Lens received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-new-search-feature-lets-you-find-objects-using-a-mix-of-text-and-images">an update for "multisearch."</a></p><p>In short, the update brought the ability for users to combine images with text when searching for items through Lens. As an example, Google says users could take a snapshot of a dress they like and add a new color in the text field. Lens would take everything into account and try to locate a similarly styled dress (or the same one), but in your preferred color.</p><p>There's no telling when "Live for AI Mode" could arrive for users; however, AI Mode <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/geminis-ai-mode-opens-up-to-more-people-with-new-features">picked up a new update</a> on May 1. After opening to everyone using Labs in the U.S., AI Mode will now display a history of your previous queries, like Gemini. Google also detailed users would soon receive the ability to tap for more details when using AI Mode. Such details would be contained within blocks for "local spots," like restaurants and stores.</p><p>Reviews, ratings, store hours, and the like will be available for interested parties.</p>

<ul><li>Early leaked renders of the Moto Edge 70 showcase a design reminiscent of the recently launched Moto Edge 60.</li><li>The device is likely to feature a triple-camera setup and be powered by a Dimensity 7000 series chipset with 12GB of RAM as standard.</li><li>A potential launch date in late September is hinted at through an easter egg in the leaked render's wallpaper, following a pattern from previous Motorola releases.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola very recently unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-60-fusion-announced">Edge 60 series</a>, and a couple of weeks later, we now get to see what the successor would look like, thanks to a new leak.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/motorola-moto-edge-70.html">Android Headlines</a>, which has showcased possible renders of the Moto Edge 70. It is quite early to see a successor render within weeks of the predecessor’s launch; however, they reveal the device in full, and it looks a lot like the recently released Moto Edge 60.</p><p>The Edge 70 is likely to carry the curved edges, and the device will also be boasting vegan leather back and a familiar camera visor with three cameras. And, like the Edge 60, the successor is also expected to have a 50MP primary camera, next to a 10MP telephoto lens and 50MP ultra-wide angle lens, the publication notes.</p>

<p>Underneath, the device is rumored to have a Dimensity 7000 series chip, likely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">Dimensity 7400</a> SoC. The RAM upgrade is also expected, and 12GB should be common across all storage variants.</p><p>As for the launch, the publication indicates that it could be somewhere around September 24 or in the same month. The date here is obtained through the Easter egg found in the phone render’s wallpaper, which is September 23. The logic considered here is also interesting because the Edge 60 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">Razr 60 series</a> official renders showcased the April 23 date, while the devices were actually launched on April 24.</p>

The Edge 60 and 60 Pro came as quad-curved devices in the segment they fall in and also equipped with the popular IP68/69 rating for ultimate protection against water and dust. Both devices are further incorporated with a host of advanced Moto AI features.</p>

<hr>
<p>Let's just say it's pouring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy foldable leaks</a>. Samsung is due to launch this year's foldables sometime in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york">July</a>, and it seems inevitable that more information about these devices will keep popping up. With this fresh set of leaks, we got insight into the display and battery capacity of the devices.</p><p>First, avid Max Jambor took to X to reveal that the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"> Galaxy Z Flip 7 </a>will have a wider display than the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on" target="_blank"> Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> (as first spotted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/tipster-confirms-wider-display-slimmer-bezels-for-galaxy-z-flip-7/" target="_blank"> Sammy Guru</a>). Jambor posted a cryptic X post that states, "B7 Display: 161.57 x 69.96 mm."</p><p>According to the publication, B7 is an internal codename given to the Galaxy Z Flip 7, meaning the phone will have the above-mentioned dimensions. The Galaxy Z Flip 6's dimensions are 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm, and the leak suggests that the next Flip will have a 166.6 x 75.2 x 6.9mm display.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">B7 Display: 161.57 x 69.96 mm<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1919350260058481088">May 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>They also seemed to have calculated the device's aspect ratio, which could be 22:9.53. This is a slightly wider aspect ratio compared to the rumored 22:9 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. If the above information is close to the truth, then the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7 might be wider and slightly taller, featuring thinner bezels than its predecessor.</p><p>In a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetechoutlook.com/tech-whispers/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-galaxy-z-flip-7-batteries-spotted-on-the-ul-demko-certification-platform/">leak</a>, the upcoming foldables were spotted in a  UL Demko certification platform. Samsung's upcoming clamshell was mentioned in the certification, with the model numbers: ‘EB-BF766ABE’ and ‘EB-BF767ABE.’</p><p>The publication notes that the charging capacities of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 totaled 4,174 mAh, which could show up with a typical capacity of 4,300 mAh, based on previous rumors. This means that the latest Galaxy Z Flip 7 could carry a larger battery than the Galaxy Z Flip 6 (4,000 mAh).</p><p>The certification also listed the alleged Galaxy Z Fold 7 batteries with model numbers ‘EB-BF966ABE’ and ‘EB-BF967ABE,’ stating that they have received the UL Demko certification.</p>

<p>According to The Tech Outlook, the certification lists that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> will show up with two Li-ion batteries totaling 4,272 mAh in rated capacity. This could be launched with a typical 4,400 mAh battery capacity, similar to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">predecessor</a>.</p><p>Of course, these are still leaks and should be taken with a grain of salt until the official launch later this year.</p><p>While we wait for the ball to drop, check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 guide</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-how-to-watch-what-to-expect"> </a>for the latest on this year's Summer Samsung Galaxy Unpacked. <br><br><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>. </em></p>

<ul><li>Instagram’s new Blend feature allows users to create a shared feed of Reels with friends in Direct Messages, based on their individual and collective Instagram activities.</li><li>The feature was first announced last month, and it is now being rolled out in phases, with users in regions like the U.S. and Canada already experiencing it.</li><li>While it appears to be a new way to consume even more Reels than users are accustomed to, it is accessible through a new Blend icon in DMs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, Instagram <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-private-blend-reels-spotted">announced a new feature</a> to keep its users more engaged, especially in the Direct Messages (DMs). The head of the social media platform, Adam Mosseri, had introduced the feature, dubbed Blend, and it appears the feature is seeing a wider rollout across regions.</p><p>Blend is a new way for Instagram users to connect with friends in DMs. It is a shared feed of popular Reels that combines recommendations from individual users and their friends—both can see a shared feed of Reels according to their tastes. Generating a shared feed is quite easy, and it can be created with a friend or in a group DM.</p>
<div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIjbqOGqjse/" target="_blank">A post shared by Adam Mosseri (@mosseri)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div>
<p>Heading over to the DM and clicking the new Blend icon would start the invite process. These suggested feeds of Reels will be based on each person’s activity on Instagram, which can include the Reels they individually watch and interact with. And when a couple of friends join a Blend, the Reels shared in the chat will be informed, and the Blend gets updated for everyone in the chat if it is a group chat or DM.</p><p>Each user in the chat has an option to either stay in the blend and also have an option to opt out at any time per their preference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.39%;"><img id="u49MY68fXFKDQqe2nCeH33" name="Instagram-Blend-feature" alt="Instagram Blend feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u49MY68fXFKDQqe2nCeH33.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="276" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted, the feature was first announced a couple of weeks ago, and while some users started experiencing the feature the same week, other users have started witnessing the new Blend icon last week, including in regions like the U.S. and Canada. It appears to be a phased rollout, and if you are not seeing the option yet, you could soon be having it in the coming days or weeks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Instagram has also introduced not a feature but an entirely new app, dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagram-finally-launches-edits-app-for-both-android-and-ios-users">Edits for Android and iOS platforms</a>, late last month. It is the company’s take on Byte Dance’s CapCut as it features advanced editing tools like clip-level precision, green screen feature, and AI image animation. It further allows content creators to see their real-time stats, including viewer engagement on Reels. It was initially announced in January, but the global rollout began last month.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-92">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly prepping the Galaxy S26 for early 2026, and the old split-chip strategy might be back, with Europe likely to get Exynos 2600, while the rest of the world sees Snapdragon.</li><li>Exynos chips have been a tough sell in Europe, especially with their lower performance, weaker graphics, and worse battery life compared to Snapdragon.</li><li>Exynos 2600 might be more energy-efficient (15–25%) than its predecessor, but its production yield isn’t there yet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is gearing up to unveil the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> lineup in early 2026, and it looks like the company's split-chip play is making a comeback. Rumor has it Europe is locked in for the Exynos 2600, while the rest of the world gets the next-gen Snapdragon.</p><p>A new leak on X from user @Jukanlosreve claims Samsung is going back to its old chipset-splitting ways for the Galaxy S26 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s26-with-exynos-2600-might-only-be-sold-in-europe-snapdragon-everywhere-else/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). And even though the launch is still a ways off, the rumor mill is already heating up.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Latest industry note related to Samsung:Exynos 2600 is indeed planned to be used in the S26.Currently, due to reportedly low yield, it is likely to be equipped mainly in European models.An industry source emphasized that even in the AP for the S26, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1918512446777770308">May 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>What’s wild is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-rumors-galaxy-s26-exynos-change">buzz about the S26 using Exynos in certain regions started popping up</a> even before the S25 was officially announced.</p><p>The latest rumor seems to back up earlier leaks, at least partly. Samsung is reportedly making strides with its 2nm Exynos 2600, but production still isn’t smooth enough for a worldwide release. So for now, it looks like regions like Europe will be the ones getting the Exynos-powered Galaxy S26.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. and a few other regions are expected to get the Galaxy S26 with Snapdragon power under the hood.</p>

<p>We heard this same song and dance last year, with talk of Samsung possibly using the Exynos 2500 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> lineup. But when the phones dropped in January, that didn’t happen, and Samsung went all-in on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite instead.</p>
<h2 id="history-repeats-itself-2">History repeats itself</h2>
<p>Samsung is no stranger to using its own Exynos chips in European <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy flagships</a>. But over the years, these in-house chips have taken heat for lagging behind Snapdragon in performance, battery efficiency, and heat control.</p><p>Galaxy fans in Europe have been sounding off for years about Exynos chips falling short, especially when it comes to graphics power and battery efficiency compared to Snapdragon.</p><p>Still, Samsung seems set on sticking with its in-house silicon. The upcoming Exynos 2600 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2600-chip-urgent-push-reported">rumored to be 15–25% more energy efficient</a>, but it's got a ways to go, with its production yield sitting around 40%, while TSMC is hitting 60%.</p><p>The latest scoop shows Samsung is all in on its Exynos chips, but we’re still not sure how the regional split will play out. It’s still up in the air whether every Galaxy S26 model will follow this pattern, or if the top-tier S26 Ultra will get Snapdragon everywhere, like the S24 Ultra did with its Snapdragon processor worldwide.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There are few consumer tech products that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">as interesting as the Mate XT</a>; Huawei somehow managed to create a tri-folding design that actually holds up to daily use, and the device gives us a great preview of where foldables are headed. There are so many things to like in the Mate XT; it is the thinnest foldable you can buy today, with Huawei outmatching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a> in this regard.</p><p>The phone has unmatched flexibility; you can use it as a regular slab phone, a fold-out device, or a full-fledged 10.2-inch tablet, and I switched between all three modes extensively in the two months I had the foldable. The internals aren't quite on par with the best that Qualcomm has to offer, but I didn't run into any slowdowns as such, and the battery life is fantastic considering the sheer size of the device.</p><p>But the most impressive feature has to be the cameras; most foldables have a camera system that doesn't measure up to traditional flagships, and this is one of the main reasons why I still haven't switched to one as my daily driver. I enjoyed using the Find N5, but it doesn't deliver the same caliber of photos as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>This is where the Mate XT has a distinct advantage; Huawei put its best imaging modules into the device, and the foldable easily pulls ahead of every other device in this category. I tested it against the Find N5, and there's no question that Huawei did a stellar job with both photos and videos. What's interesting is that the Mate XT manages to hold its own against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and that is an achievement in and of itself.</p>

<p>The Mate XT produced photos with accurate color rendition; it was an overcast day, and the foldable did a good job highlighting that. The Find N5 has cooler colors, and it had issues with shadows, often failing to deliver the same level of detail around the edges.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=e4c52042-295a-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>
<p>Both foldables did a decent job in this image, but once again, the Find N5 has increased contrast and saturation, and it doesn't quite have the same accuracy. It also loses out on detail when you zoom in to the image.</p>

<p>You get great versatility with the Mate XT as well, and the phone delivers the same caliber of photos with the wide-angle and tele lenses. The wide-angle camera has a greater field of view, and it produces better quality of photos than the Find N5.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ff332a5a-295a-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>
<p>Similarly, the Mate XT did a good job preserving color balance at 2x and 5.5x zoom, and you get a good amount of detail.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=4c6922f2-295b-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>
<p>The biggest difference is with portrait shots; in this photo, the Mate XT got all the details right and correctly blurred out the background while having both phones visible, and it took several tries to get a similar result on the Find N5.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=65224cec-295b-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>
<p>In a similar vein, the Mate XT does a great job in low-light situations, producing consistent colors and managing highlights well.</p>
<p>What's notable is how well the phone holds up against the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, which has one of the strongest camera packages of any 2025 device.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=9b0a38ec-295b-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>

<p>Xiaomi does a better job overall as the sensor is able to take in greater light, and the brand's camera tuning delivers cleaner photos with great vibrancy. That said, the Mate XT is pretty close, and that is praiseworthy.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=b7aab6e8-295b-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>

<p>The differences between the two is diminished in low-light scenarios, particularly when using the wide-angle lens.</p>

<p>On the whole, Huawei did an incredible job with the Mate XT. While the main attraction is clearly the panel that unfolds to a 10.2-inch tablet, the cameras and great battery life turn it into a fantastic daily driver. Yes, it is the costliest phone around — by a significant amount — but the device is an all-rounder like no other.</p>

<ul><li>Android now natively supports OpenID standards for digital credential presentation and issuance.</li><li>Users can securely store and send cryptographically verifiable digital documents across different apps.</li><li>This update enables wider use of digital credentials for various purposes, including account recovery and identity verification on different platforms.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently expanded its Digital ID access through its Wallet app for residents in the U.K. And to further expand the interoperability across different apps that store digital identities, the search giant is aiming to support open standards via various identity providers and services through the Android operating system.</p><p>Last week, through an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/announcing-android-support-of-digital-credentials.html?m=1">Android Developers blog post</a>, the company has announced that, “Android, via Credential Manager's DigitalCredential API, now natively supports OpenID4VP and OpenID4VCI for digital credential presentation and issuance respectively.”</p>
<p>As the search giant further explains, the Digital Credentials are cryptographically verifiable documents. They can include documents like driver's licenses, passports, or national IDs. And, through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android apps</a> and with the help of the respective app developers, more can be incorporated and submitted digitally like education certifications, insurance policies, permits, for example in the near future.</p><p>Currently, the supported digital documents can be stored in "credential holders" apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> and Samsung Wallet. Some apps like banking or airline apps would, however, sometimes require the digital document for verification, which is not necessarily stored in the respective banking app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3375px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="X7hXneZDSgYkAMBeaPL3ii" name="android-digital-credentials-selection-interface" alt="Android Digital Credentials selection interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7hXneZDSgYkAMBeaPL3ii.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3375" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Android supports secure sharing between devices through CTAP protocols. Users will be able to store multiple credentials across apps and choose which one to pick using OpenID4VP requests from websites or Android Credential Manager API.</p><p>The process involves verifier sending an OpenID4VP request to the Digital Credential API, prompting the user to select a credential. The user here only chooses a credential, not a digital wallet app. Android then redirects the request to the digital wallet app holding the credential to complete the action.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>One of the coolest things about Nothing’s CMF line of products is their modularity. By definition, this means that you can take parts off and readily replace them as you see fit. For products like the CMF Watch Pro 2, that means you can swap the bezels, not just the bands.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 was even more modular, allowing you to easily drop on accessories via an external screw system, which also allowed you to remove the entire back and replace it with basically anything you could find. This caused an entire 3D-printed cottage industry to pop up on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1812538797/custom-cmf-phone-1-rear-case-3d-printed">shops like Etsy</a>, making the CMF Phone 1 the coolest phone to debut in 2024.</p><p>However, the CMF Phone 2 Pro does things a little differently, and I didn’t realize that until it was too late. As I unboxed the phone, I took the time to unscrew the back and work on prying it off. The original phone’s back design wasn’t the easiest to get off, so I wasn’t surprised it took me a bit of work to remove this one, but I wasn’t expecting the plastic to crack the way it did as I got halfway through the process.</p>

<p>After conferring with my Nothing PR contact, the company confirmed that the back of the CMF Phone 2 Pro isn’t designed to be removable the way the CMF Phone 1 was.</p><p>Looking back at the spec sheet, it’s clear this is how Nothing improved the ingress protection (IP) rating of the phone, from IP52 on the CMF Phone 1 to IP54 on the CMF Phone 2. That number four in the rating means the CMF Phone 2 Pro can now withstand splashing of water from any direction, while Phone 1 was only resistant against water drops up to a 15-degree angle.</p><p>But none of this changes the fact that I now have a CMF Phone 2 Pro with a broken back and a need to order a replacement part.</p>

<p>Instead of the pain-in-the-butt removable back of the original — if you used it you’d know how difficult it was to remove — Nothing went with a “Universal cover” design featured in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro review</a> by Android Central's Harish Jonnalagadda. This cover uses all five screws to attach to the back of the phone and not only enables the use of MagSafe accessories and several other official CMF magnetic accessories, but it also gives users the ability to click additional lenses onto the cameras.</p><p>The problem, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CMFTech/comments/1kbytl1/where_are_the_accessories_for_the_cmf_phone_2_pro/">users have already found out</a>, is that this case is not only difficult to find right after launch, but U.S. beta program users don’t seem to have access to it at all. As Nothing specifically told me, these accessories are “only available on Nothing.tech in Europe + UK with limited qty.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4Pc9ySngqNcMkCJ5iJ3zzV" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Pc9ySngqNcMkCJ5iJ3zzV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That basically means it’s up to Etsy and the 3D printing community to save the CMF Phone 2 Pro’s proverbial butt since Nothing itself doesn’t seem to be making a lot of accessories for the phone. I’m relatively OK with this, as I think the community proved itself the first time around and can do it again, but it’s still disappointing to see such a major design change happen and a product not receive the support it needs out of the gate to make up for it.</p><p>Lesson learned: don’t take the back off your CMF Phone 2 Pro unless you’ve already got a replacement in hand. This semi-modular phone is going to be amazing once accessory makers get off the ground and get producing products for it. For now, at least, it’s still an incredible value-priced phone that’ll exceed any expectations you might have for what a sub-$300 phone is capable of.</p>

Garmin skimped on the Elevate v5 sensor and topo maps, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">Instinct 2</a> owners still get dual-band GPS, built-in LEDs, sleep coach, training load focus, and a gyroscope on top of Garmin's usual training tools.</p><p>The problem? Garmin has reached an inflection point. Any groundbreaking features or mainstream smarts go to the $1,000 Fenix 8; then, Garmin withholds these features from "cheaper" models for years to prop up the flagships. That's why the Instinct 3 feels like a bulky Forerunner with a flashlight, with no "adventurer" tools.</p><p>Thankfully, anyone upgrading from a years-old Garmin watch shouldn't feel my dissatisfaction: The Instinct 3 is an impressive fitness watch on its own merits. But the AMOLED facelift aside, only hardcore Garmin fans who're lukewarm about mainstream "smarts" will want the Instinct 3.</p>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 ships in 45mm and 50mm sizes, each with AMOLED and MIP Solar variants. There are "Tactical" MIP and AMOLED models and a budget Instinct E MIP; so far, there's no Instinct 3 Surf, Dezl, or Camo edition, like the Instinct 2 had.</p><p>The Garmin Instinct 3 Solar costs $399 and $449 for the 0.9-inch and 1.1-inch models, respectively; the 1.2- and 1.3-inch Instinct 3 AMOLED cost $449 and $499.</p>

<p>My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-vs-2x-vs-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2X vs. 2</a> guide breaks down specific feature differences. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a>, as a compromise upgrade, got 3rd-gen perks like multi-band GPS and the flashlight in 2023. Its solar recharging crushes the Instinct 2 Solar but falls well short of the 3 Solar.</p><p>The Instinct 3 AMOLED battery life is comparable to the Instinct 2 Solar's unless you regularly spend hours in direct sunlight to recharge. There <em>is</em> a weeks-long gap between the Instinct 3 Solar and AMOLED, if you can stomach the low-res, grayscale display.</p>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED has double the pixels per inch as the grayscale Solar display. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">MIP displays</a> are more readable outdoors but nearly illegible indoors. The AMOLED model is more readable at home while bright enough for outdoor treks, with no pressure to <em>seek out</em> sunlight to recharge.</p><p>Older Instincts (and new 3 Solar) tracked the same data, but their two-window, low-res displays lacked space for graphs, forcing users to use Garmin's mobile app to see their progress over time. This newest model solves that problem, making data more accessible.</p>

<p>The ten default watch faces all fit several data fields — like your steps, Body Battery, recovery time, heart rate, battery life, and the weather — saving you from searching for the data.</p><p>Unfortunately, you still rely on the Up/Down buttons to navigate the non-touch display. They're more consistent during workouts but feel slow when navigating through menus. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Vivoactive 6</a> have touch controls, so it's probably about battery efficiency, not cost.

<p>Display aside, the Instinct 3 sticks to the trademark bulky design you'd expect from this lineup. The raised bezel and thick, shockproof polymer protect the display and components from falls, while the 10ATM water resistance ensures the roughest water sports won't break through its shell.</p><p>The Instinct design may appeal to G-Shock fans who don't need premium materials. The new aluminum layer bisects the bezel and case so it doesn't look like one uniform heap of plastic, like past models. And I like my limited edition Neo Tropic finish: its muted greens feel at home in a forest.</p>

<p>Most people will find the Instinct 3 too <em>big</em> and buttoned to be attractive. The Instinct 2X flopped in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a>; even though the metal-edged Instinct 3 looks slightly better, it's still too bulky and athletic for most. Other Garmin watches can blend in more in professional contexts.</p><p>But if you ignore its looks, the Instinct 3 is more comfortable than you'd think. My 50mm model only weighs 59g, or 11g and 30g lighter than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> 45mm and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> 47mm, respectively.</p>

<p>One of my biggest complaints with the last-gen Instincts was how <em>slow</em> the processor was. Noticeable lag accompanied every button press, making menu navigation a chore, and simple feature updates caused problems because of limited memory.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/garmin-instinct-3-in-depth-review-amoled-solar.html">DC Rainmaker</a> warns that the Instinct 3 Solar shares this issue since the system software takes up most of its 128MB of memory. I'm glad the Instinct 3 AMOLED has 4GB of space, with plenty of leeway.</p><p>The Instinct 3 still feels slower than other Garmin watches, even if it's faster than the Instinct 2. The missing touchscreen aside, every button press or uploaded workout has a tiny delay. But this sluggishness is the price paid to help the Instinct 3 last longer.</p>

<p>For context, the Forerunner 265 and Venu 3 last 13 or 14 days, respectively, while the Instinct 3 45mm and 50mm last 18 or 24 days. These other models aren't slouches, but an extra week makes a difference.</p><p>More importantly, the Instinct 3 lasts up to 30 hours in SatIQ mode with multi-band GPS, beating the Forerunner 265 by 14 hours, though losing to the Fenix 8 51mm by 32 hours.</p><p>Garmin's watches typically fall a few days or GPS hours short of the official battery estimates. On paper, you should only burn about 3% of your Instinct 3 battery per hour of activity; I observed at least 5%. But that's still significantly better than almost any other fitness watch I've tested!</p>

<p>The only true battery killer is the built-in flashlight. It has four white-LED intensity levels and a dimmer red LED; you can set any intensity to various strobe patterns to flash your presence, signaling your presence to cars and cyclists at night.</p><p>I've never cared to use Garmin's torch much. It's nice to whip out with a quick double-button tap to stumble to the bathroom, illuminate your pathway, or navigate a tent zipper without blinding others nearby. However, its max brightness can't match a typical phone flashlight, while still burning through your battery quickly.</p><p>I'd rather have it and not need it than the opposite. If your phone dies in an emergency, this flashlight is much better than the display flashlight mode on most watches. But if you regularly run at night, you'll still need a knuckle light or headlamp.</p>

<p>Garmin gave the Instinct 3 the same Elevate v4 sensor as the last few years of Garmin watches. While its multi-band GPS is industry-leading for accuracy, it hasn't changed much in recent years, aside from the SatIQ mode, which saves battery by only using multiple satellites when there's signal blockage.</p><p>All that is to say, if you've read any of my dozen Garmin reviews since 2022, there's nothing new to say here. I'll run through my results briefly, but the Instinct 3 is about as accurate as any other recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>.</p>

<p>The Instinct 3's optical HR sensor did fairly well keeping up with an optical arm band, with only a little lag, and ended with the same average heart rate.

<p>During the run, the dual-band Vantage M3 measured 0.01 miles or 16m more distance than the Instinct 3, which was using SatIQ mode. Polar's tracking was slightly more accurate at most points, while Garmin tended to drift off the trail a bit under light foliage while staying dead-on when unobstructed.</p><p>This is my typical experience with SatIQ mode, which doesn't always kick in with better accuracy quickly enough.

<p>Garmin packs too many features into its watches to reasonably address one by one, so I've listed the highlights, bolding the features that the Instinct 2 lacked.</p><p>After a night of sleep, you'll get a sleep score and coaching on how to improve it baked into your Morning Report along with HRV status, Body Battery, training readiness, weather, and any calendar reminders.</p><p>Garmin is particularly good at judging heart rate variability, which measures your body's workout recovery and all-night blood oxygen levels. I just wish we had ECG and skin temperature readings.</p>

<p>Despite its extra memory and new display, the Instinct 3 isn't "smart." You won't find music storage, offline maps, Bluetooth calling, or commands. Its LiveTrack and emergency tools only work through your phone because it lacks an LTE option.</p><p>The Instinct 3's lightweight CPU helps it last longer, so I'm fine with most limitations. But I <em>fully</em> attribute its breadcrumb navigation to Garmin's rigid price tiers. Most recent AMOLED fitness watches in the $300+ range have started adding topographic maps, so you can download your regional data and follow nearby trails in an emergency. The Instinct 3 "adventure watch" should have done the same!</p>

<p>Thankfully, Garmin didn't hold the Instinct 3 back for general training guidance. You get the full training suite, including daily workout suggestions, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">low/high aerobic and anaerobic load breakdowns</a> to help guide your training, and long-term Garmin Coach plans.</p><p>New advanced running and cycling dynamics analyze your form. Your grade-adjusted pace tells you how fast you're truly going relative to the elevation gain or loss. During intervals, the Instinct 3 can show your rest timer, allow for open repeats, or auto-detect starts — things the Instinct 2's tiny brain couldn't handle.</p>

<p>There are a few software perks on the Fenix 8 like hill & endurance scores, Strava Live Segments, diving tools, and (again) topo maps that you might wish the Instinct 3 had. But overall, the core Garmin experience is the same as ever. It's very easy to use this watch to get fitter or faster, and the AMOLED display exhibits your data in accessible charts.</p><p>As a final side note, the Instinct 3 doesn't come with a complimentary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect Plus subscription</a> period, which is a shame. No <em>major</em> Instinct 3 features are locked behind this paywall, but you may still end up paying for it.</p>

<p>I loved the Garmin Instinct 2 and 2X for their longevity, but I barely used them outside of workouts. By adding an AMOLED display, the Instinct 3 is slightly more usable, even if the buttons and slow CPU hold it back.</p><p>The Instinct 3 AMOLED feels like a longer-lived, rugged Forerunner 265, but since that came out in 2023 — and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-975-and-275-will-show-if-garmin-is-running-out-of-ideas">Forerunner 275 and 975</a> should (allegedly) arrive soon — I'm not sure if Garmin gave its new Instinct enough of a distinct identity, now that it's not an "unlimited" battery watch.</p><p>Garmin Instinct fans clearly don't care about the bells and whistles, however, so they won't care that the Instinct 3 doesn't have them! Ignore my nitpicks and enjoy the fact that it's objectively better than the Instinct 2 and 2X.</p>

It's easy to look at book-style foldables, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, as the premium option, with clamshell foldables serving as the more affordable entry into the market. When I first got into the foldable space, that's exactly what I thought.</p><p>My first purchase was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>, and I quickly upgraded to the Galaxy Z Fold 4 as soon as I could afford it. Bigger must be better, and the more expensive one must be the best one, right? A few years later, after spending extended time with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 in my pocket, I can't believe how wrong I was.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kCFoS9NbMAUwvfELWfypJ9" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Main-Screen" alt="The Pixel 9 Pro Fold's main screen open in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kCFoS9NbMAUwvfELWfypJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No matter how much I <em>want</em> to love having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">giant foldable</a> in my pocket, I just don't end up using it. The cover screen gets used about 90% of the time, and the 10% that I use the large main screen ends up feeling like a chore. Neither option is as ergonomically sound as, say, using a clamshell foldable or a normal flagship.</p><p>All these experiences added up over years testing foldables. Eventually, they came to a head when I took my main SIM out of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (my then-daily driver) to test the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and the Pixel 9a. After a few weeks without the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, I simply realized I didn't want to go back. Here's why.</p>
<h2 id="everything-book-style-foldables-get-wrong-and-right-2">Everything book-style foldables get wrong (and right)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TbXMRzhz2TDzGYuePc9DtL" name="Phone-Form-Factor-Comparison-3" alt="Foldable phones compared across form factors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbXMRzhz2TDzGYuePc9DtL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Pixel 9 Pro Fold doesn't offer as much extra space for video as you might expect. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's objectively true that book-style foldables offer more screen real estate than typical flagships and clamshells. However, whether that extra space will be useful to you will depend on what exactly you plan to do with it. I hoped to use my assortment of large foldables — including two generations each of Galaxy Z Fold and Pixel Fold models — for superior media consumption. In theory, everything from movies to YouTube videos should pop.</p><p>This led to my biggest let-down of using foldables. Due to the widescreen nature of most long-form video, using a Pixel 9 Pro Fold or Galaxy Z Fold 6 didn't make my content that much larger, as you can see in the photo above. The average video on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold is just marginally bigger than what you'd get from a standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. Of course, you can crop in, but you'll lose a massive chunk of content — it becomes borderline unenjoyable.</p><p>So, the big-screen foldables weren't the content-consumption powerhouses I had hoped. What about other use cases that <em>should </em>benefit from a larger screen, like productivity and gaming? They were similarly underwhelming.</p><p>Both the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 suffered from odd aspect ratios and poor user interfaces, and typing is specifically difficult on the Pixel's wide form factor. Productivity apps aren't truly tapping into the big screens on large foldables, and Chrome <em>still</em> refuses to load many websites in true desktop mode. You could make the case that it should do this by default when the main screen is opened, like how it works on an iPad mini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="F4nXdS8W3Q2CdCuPuq8dLn" name="Two-Apps-Pixel-Fold" alt="Multitasking on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F4nXdS8W3Q2CdCuPuq8dLn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I will say that the excellent productivity feature on both the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is opening two apps in split-screen mode. You can do this on many Android phones, but doing so on a large foldable with the main screen open effectively gives you two separate windows the size of the cover screen. It's amazing for times when you need to view multiple screens or apps at the same time to work.</p><p>That said, gaming was largely disappointing for me for a few reasons. On a Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it's clear that the Tensor G4 chip inside is holding the device back. Games like Fortnite, which can run on something as lowly as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/this-is-how-nintendo-aims-to-stop-switch-2-emulation">Nintendo Switch</a>, struggle to hit decent frame rates with subpar graphics.

<p>It's clear that book-style foldables, like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold, are what we call a "jack of all trades." They can be a normal phone when you need them to be, and a tablet when you want a bigger screen. They make calls, handle spreadsheets, take photos, and can even play some games.</p><p>However, they're not excellent at <em>any</em> of those things. After using both for months at a time, I'm convinced the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold — and big foldables in general — are jacks of all trades, but masters of none.</p><p>I've tried to make large foldables fit into my life and workflow for three full years, starting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>'s release date. Now, I'm certain that I would rather have the right device for the task at hand than one that tries to do it all in a way that's just fine.</p><p>You can buy a new Google Pixel 9, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, and a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">Steam Deck</a> for the same price or less than a Galaxy Z Fold 6 or Pixel 9 Pro Fold at retail, and I'd absolutely choose those three excellent products over a foldable. While I might give <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">clamshell foldables</a> another shot in the near future, I think it's safe to say that I'm done using a book-style foldable as my daily driver.</p>

Fast-forward about a year later, and Project Astra is in the hands of millions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, and Gemini Advanced users. It's ready, and it's here — but is it actually useful?</p><p>The answer is that it absolutely can be, as long as its use cases are personal to you. For instance, Gemini Live's multimodal features aren't going to be a better alternative to Google Search or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> in most cases. However, in specific circumstances where it's better to show than tell, Gemini Live's camera support can come in handy.</p><p>After weeks of testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> with video streaming, the feature has become an irreplaceable part of one of my non-tech hobbies: gardening. I've done it all my life, but after moving from the Garden State to the Arizona desert, I had to relearn <em>everything </em>— new growing seasons, care techniques, problems, and everything in between.</p><p>To my surprise, it wasn't Google or Reddit that helped me navigate this climate most. It was Gemini Live.</p>

<p>AI can be fun to play around with, but it's only truly useful if you know when to use it. Specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-lives-video-streaming-screen-sharing-support-comes-to-pixel-9-series">Gemini Live's camera features</a> offer the most utility when you have something right in front of you that you're not sure how to describe. Maybe it's a piece of furniture in a coffee shop you don't know the name of, or a monument with a faded plaque. In these situations, typing a written prompt into a chatbot or a search engine won't do you any good.</p><p>That's where you'd want to turn on your camera in Gemini Live. It'll help out in many situations, including identifying plants. I picked up a few small potted plants from Ikea and turned to Gemini Live to figure out exactly what they were and how to care for them. Here's how Gemini responded, based on pointing my camera at the plant:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>That looks like an aloe vera plant! Is there anything you'd like to know about aloe vera care?</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>While this is all happening off-device, Gemini returned the answer pretty fast. Sure enough, it looks like an aloe vera plant. After that, I took the AI assistant up on its offer to enlighten me on care options. Here's what it said:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Sure, aloe vera plants are easy to care for. They need bright, sunny spots and well-drained soil. You should let the soil dry out between watering. During the spring and summer, you'll want to water it about every two weeks. In the fall and winter, you can cut back to about once a month.</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>The responses were clear and concise, and they ended up saving me a ton of time researching care instructions for a plant I wasn't even sure the name of a few minutes earlier.</p>
<h2 id="it-ll-come-up-with-care-options-for-your-plants-too-2">It'll come up with care options for your plants, too</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-4" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-new-gemini-live-experience-with-saved-audio-recordings">Gemini Live</a> were only able to identify plants by looking at them, it would be cool, but it wouldn't be groundbreaking. The killer feature here is the care instructions that Gemini can provide just by looking at a plant. To test this, I showed it a live camera feed of my basil plant and asked how I should take care of it, and Gemini replied with the following:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>That's a nice basil plant! It needs about six hours of sunlight each day, so a sunny spot is perfect. You should water it when the top inch of soil feels dry, and make sure the pot has good drainage. Do you have a sunny spot in mind for it?</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>I then told Gemini I was planning to keep the basil out on my balcony, and it seemed to like the idea.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A balcony is a great spot! Basil thrives with six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day. Just make sure to bring it inside if the temperature drops below 50 degrees or rises above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>The cool thing about going "live" with Gemini is that you can easily provide context or follow-up questions in real time. For example, when the AI suggested I bring it inside when the temperature drops, I could let Gemini know that it won't be an issue in my climate. It's easy to get context-specific advice when using your camera with Gemini Live.</p>
<h2 id="when-issues-arise-gemini-live-can-diagnose-them-2">When issues arise, Gemini Live can diagnose them</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="P2AwZxehgPi2Smy7Ldjx8X" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-2" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2AwZxehgPi2Smy7Ldjx8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By far, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">Gemini Live's</a> most useful capability is diagnosing problems you might run into with your plants. As I mentioned earlier, I'm new to growing plants in the desert, and it's a learning curve. Since the sun is so intense and the temperature can exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the climate is unforgiving. I was bound to run into issues, and Gemini Live helped me navigate them.</p><p>In one case, my hydroponic jalapeño and tomato plants were having a hard time. The jalapeño leaves were browning, and the tomatoes just weren't turning red. It was Gemini that suggested my apartment's temperature could be the problem, and sure enough, after turning up the heat for a few days, the tomatoes ripened. It also identified health problems with my plants, as explained in the reply below:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Your jalapeño plant looks like it might have a few issues. The leaves are curling and have some brown spots, which could be from overwatering or a nutrient deficiency. The tomatoes also look like they might have blossom end rot, which is caused by a calcium deficiency. Do you have any plant fertilizer on hand?</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's important to remember that while you're reading the transcript of my conversation with Gemini, this is all being spoken to me in real-time — the same way you'd have a conversation with another person.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-3" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I realized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini Live's multimodal features</a> were the real deal when it noticed that I was using an AeroGarden hydroponic system just from the information it could see via my camera feed. After picking up on that information, I received tailored care instructions as follows:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Okay, great. You can try adding a balanced liquid fertilizer to the water in your AeroGarden, following the instructions on the label. That should help with any nutrient issues. For the blossom end rot on the tomatoes, you can try adding a calcium supplement to the water.</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>While I might usually dive into gardening books, research studies, or Reddit threads for hours to solve these types of problems, everything you see in this article happened within just a few minutes.</p><p>Often, plant growing problems can show the same symptoms, making them hard to diagnose, especially when you're just getting started. Gemini was vital in helping me overcome them.</p>
<h2 id="my-plants-are-stronger-than-ever-thanks-to-gemini-live-2">My plants are stronger than ever thanks to Gemini Live</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YknC8dSpXbvXBMUsJ89xi4" name="Gemini-Logo-Plants" alt="The Gemini logo overlaid on tomato plants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YknC8dSpXbvXBMUsJ89xi4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've gotten this far and aren't as excited by Gemini's gardening prowess as I am, fear not. This is just one way Gemini Live can help you out in your daily life, and there are many more. I used Gemini to solve problems with my plants, but in the tech world, we simply call that troubleshooting.</p><p>You could follow the exact same steps for just about anything else you need to figure out. In Google's first-ever demo of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra at Google I/O 2024</a>, it used the technology to troubleshoot a finicky record player. These are exactly the kinds of things AI can be great at — it is trained on material that includes user manuals, textbooks, and even online forums. You can tap into the online history of the internet without doing any of the work.</p><p>So, before you write off Gemini Live, give its new multimodal camera support a try. When you find <em>your</em> use case for it, it'll become invaluable.</p>

<p>This year, it will be five years since LG launched what’s considered its last flagship smartphone. The LG Wing was a very unique device featuring a swivel design that you won’t really find anywhere else, and probably for good reason. The novel design was one that turned heads, but surprisingly (or maybe not), the LG Wing ultimately failed to garner enough attention to keep LG in the game. The following year, LG announced it was leaving the smartphone business.</p><p>I’ve been holding onto the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-wing-review">LG Wing</a> for the past five years, and it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lg.com/tw/support/announcement/TWNTC2025041101/?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&cjevent=2dd6379727a011f080ac009b0a1cb828&utm_source=cj-affiliate-2470763&utm_medium=affiliate">recently announced</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-smartphone-updates-3548804/">Android Authority</a>) that LG will soon shut down its update service, meaning that anyone still using an LG phone will soon no longer be able to update it.</p><p>Fortunately, I’ve managed to keep my Wing updated (as much as possible) over the years. It's mostly been collecting dust in a drawer all the time, so as a self-proclaimed former LG fanboy, I recently decided to revisit this unique device and take it for a spin now that it's been some time since LG bowed out.</p>
<h2 id="the-wing-had-some-interesting-ideas-2">The Wing had some interesting ideas</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Rfs9TCRaKLSTn569Fewe5a" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-01" alt="The LG Wing main swivel screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rfs9TCRaKLSTn569Fewe5a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LG Wing came at a time when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> were still getting off the ground. They weren't as popular as they are today, and companies were still working out the hardware and software intricacies that came with building foldables. That's where the Wing came in, offering an alternative for anyone who worried about the longevity of a folding display.</p><p>At the time, I thought LG was smart to forgo the potential costs associated with developing a foldable phone. Instead, the company leaned on the latest (and eventually final) evolution of the Second Screen concept it had been pushing on consumers for years.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3953px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="YR5ZHN2Y8LPgCycMXLsnqY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-16" alt="The LG Wing next to a bush" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YR5ZHN2Y8LPgCycMXLsnqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3953" height="2224" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The idea was fairly simple in concept: you can use the phone as you regularly would on its primary display, but then you could reveal a secondary screen whenever you needed it. It stayed out of sight until it was needed, which I really appreciated.</p><p>LG also had some ideas of how this second screen could be used. Apps could utilize both displays in unique ways, which actually made a fair amount of sense. For instance, when the main display was swiveled up, I could watch a YouTube video in full view on the horizontal screen while the various video controls remained on the second screen underneath. This made it easy to adjust volume, brightness, skip forward, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3906px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gMmJXW9YYJYzFLMyeBbri6" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-19" alt="YouTube on the LG Wing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gMmJXW9YYJYzFLMyeBbri6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3906" height="2197" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other use for the second screen was multitasking. My favorite use case was always using Google Maps on the primary display to navigate, while the second screen would be used to control music.</p><p>Of course, there's much more you can do with it, so long as you're okay with some apps being squished down to the almost-square aspect ratio. But to me, this made me think of multitasking in ways I never considered before. Since I'm not a fan of using split screen on standard candybar phones, this gave me another option that I much preferred.</p><p>LG also had a fun mouse function that let you use the second screen to control the main display.</p>

<p>Then there's the camera. LG did something pretty unique by adding a secondary ultrawide "Gimbal Motion Camera" that's rotated 90-degrees and would work when the phone is in Swivel Mode. Basically, this allowed the users to move the viewfinder around without needing to physically move the sensor and helped stabilize videos in a similar way to an actual gimbal camera system.</p><p>It's a unique way to take advantage of the phone's unique form factor, as you can simply hold the phone by the second screen for more stable handling of the phone when recording. It also potentially saves you from having to purchase a separate smartphone gimbal.</p>

<p>I will say that I was thoroughly surprised at the photo quality from the main wide and ultrawide sensors. I was always a fan of LG's video capabilities, but photo quality always left a lot to be desired on previous LG phones I've used, so it was good to see LG improve on this front with the Wing.</p><p>In the LG Wing review, it was noted how the primary camera "goes toe-to-toe with some of the best Android cameras out there, with impressive dynamic range and color clarity, plus minimal noise even in darker conditions." I wouldn't say that LG could compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best Android cameras of 2025</a>, but it certainly wasn't bad for 2020.</p><p>Unfortunately, camera improvements and a novel smartphone form factor were not enough to save the Wing or LG.</p>
<h2 id="too-many-compromises-2">Too many compromises</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xo7JFZscFVmwAFEWZ3XKYZ" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-10" alt="The LG Wing lying face down on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xo7JFZscFVmwAFEWZ3XKYZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, the LG Wing was a flop. I can't say whether it was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that saw consumers making fewer non-essential spending choices or just the overall reception of the LG Wing and its admittedly cool but strange design. Either way, the phone did not resonate with consumers.</p><p>For one, the phone was expensive at launch for what you got. It cost $999 but featured a squarely mid-range Snapdragon chipset usually reserved for cheaper smartphones. By comparison, the more conventional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-v60-thinq-5g-review">LG V60</a> cost less, featured a more powerful flagship Snapdragon chipset, and had a larger battery, making it feel like a better deal.</p><p>But more than that, it felt like LG was trying to do the absolute most with the absolute least, and the payoff just wasn't there.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="m6VMc5GUBRMfR5p3oYeU7a" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-07" alt="The LG Wing with Google Search on the Swivel screen and the LG keyboard on the Second screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m6VMc5GUBRMfR5p3oYeU7a.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3948px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="nmDUw3MNF5TJbGrSw6mWxZ" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-08" alt="The LG Wing with Gboard on the Swivel screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmDUw3MNF5TJbGrSw6mWxZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3948" height="2221" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>LG wasn't known for having the best software, and while I never particularly minded it, many considered the UI to be behind Samsung's One UI and others. That said, it feels like LG is stretching itself thin trying to get the Wing to work properly.</p><p>Switching from regular to Swivel mode and back feels janky, adding apps to the Second Screen is more cumbersome than it needs to be, and Gboard can't be used properly in Swivel mode; only LG keyboard will work on the Second Screen, which kinda misses the point if I have to use Gboard on the primary display while in swivel mode.</p><p>Samsung has a similar limitation on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>, where I can <em>only</em> use Samsung Keyboard, and it's a key annoyance for me.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Software and support were some of the biggest issues with the Wing.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That highlights a key problem with Swivel Mode on the LG Wing: as cool as it was, it also felt woefully underutilized. LG just didn't garner the kind of app support that was needed to fully take advantage of it. At launch, it leaned heavily on YouTube, the Whale browser, and an optimized version of Asphalt 9 to show off how apps could utilize the second screen, but the selection remained lacking throughout its lifecycle.</p><p>This left multitasking as the main function for the second screen, which wasn't enough of a draw for this phone.</p><p>LG was also known for not having the best update cadence or policy, which also didn't help the Wing's case. Funnily enough, I feel like it improved after LG <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-official-lg-exiting-smartphone-business">announced</a> its departure from the smartphone market, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lg-wing-android-13-update">the Wing has since received three OS upgrades</a> up to Android 13.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3185px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="sPZX3Kp7QYKroQSsshKHCY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-12" alt="The LG Wing with two apps next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sPZX3Kp7QYKroQSsshKHCY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3185" height="1792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the gimbal camera, which was cool in theory, but was always the phone's weakest point for me. I wanted to really like it, but the video quality was never particularly good, to the point where I would just stick to the main wide and ultrawide sensors. It didn't help that video was capped at FHD in Gimbal Mode, and the result was a surprisingly noisy and just not good.</p><p>The Wing had an opportunity to take my video, my favorite thing about LG phones, and really do something cool, but in the end, it just fell flat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3730px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9C38DDDccCVnryG7Uv8LqY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-09" alt="The LG Wing selfie camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9C38DDDccCVnryG7Uv8LqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3730" height="2098" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Holding the phone years later, I also can't help but notice how the Wing also just feels surprisingly un-LG in a weird way. The unique form factor was a very LG thing to do, but the compromises felt a bit uncharacteristic, such as the lack of stereo speakers and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Even the design choices, with a curved display, fingerprint magnet on the back panel, and noisy pop-up selfie camera, make the phone feel like it was built by a different company.</p><p>The phone is also heavy (at 260g, it's heavier than even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>), only features an IP54 water and dust resistance rating, and the fingerprint sensor is very slow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PgcyUaFBk3UaRXcMyFJijY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-06" alt="The LG Wing with fingerprints all over its back glass panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PgcyUaFBk3UaRXcMyFJijY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>LG was great at standing out with its experimental phones, and the Wing was clearly never meant to be a huge hit, but LG made some odd choices that I feel ensured it wouldn't do well.</p><p>That said, I can't help but feel like some of what we got with the LG Wing helped prepare me for foldables, particularly flip phones.</p>

<p>Foldables weren't my thing back in 2020, but with the resurgence of the Motorola Razr, I've gone all-in on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>. It's a familiar design that spans generations, and now with modern smartphone technology, it can live on in a much-smarter and user-friendly way. Where LG tried to differentiate itself with the Wing, modern flip phones relied heavily on the past to gain popularity.</p><p>Still, I think the Wing was onto something with its smaller second screen. This wasn't meant to be a primary way of interacting with the phone, but an optional way for users to get a little extra out of their devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="atKEe6BRiJzUQ8oDGuPknZ" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-03" alt="The LG Wing Second Screen next to the Razr Plus 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atKEe6BRiJzUQ8oDGuPknZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Modern flagship flip phones take a similar approach, yet they make the smaller cover screen a first option as a way to quickly get through notifications, messages, and more. Then, if and when necessary, you can open the device to reveal a regular-sized smartphone.</p><p>With this in mind, I can't help but think LG would have done better to opt for a flip phone form factor than to try and reinvent the wheel with a Swivel phone. It may have taken a generation or two to really take off, but given the growing popularity of the Razr and Galaxy Z Flip lineups, maybe we would still have LG around to keep us on our toes with other unique devices like the unreleased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/lg-rollable-hands-on-video">Rollable phone</a>.</p>

It's always been that way, and the reason has never changed — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everyone-is-talking-about-google-i-o-but-what-exactly-is-it-and-who-is-it-for">Google I/O is not for you and me</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. If you're a software developer interested in Google's consumer products, or if you are interested in becoming one, then it is for you. If you're a regular Jane or Joe, like most of us, then it's a couple of days of talk about tokens and APIs with a tiny bit of interesting stuff sprinkled through.</p><p>It's my job to pay attention, and I still love to dabble with development, but even I get overwhelmed. Not that I'm some sort of tech Superman, but I am closer to the actual <em>intended</em> audience than most.</p>
<p>Don't worry though, because after all these years I have figured out exactly how to digest what's cool and different coming from Google's annual developer conference: don't pay a lot of attention to it.</p>

<p>Really, I'm serious. If you're a bit of a nerd, then the keynote and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16" target="_blank"><em>What's New in Android</em></a> presentations can be fun to watch, but be prepared to hear about stuff like those tokens, limits, AI engines, and analytical training for most of the hour.</p><p>Let people like me, who are forced to watch and pay attention, do it. Then we tell you about it, without all the tech-nerd gobbly-goo. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-teases-a-special-i-o-edition-of-the-android-show">Anything cool</a> will be all over your favorite tech websites; we'll be covering it extensively because it's what we at Android Central do best. We might even get a little nerdy from time to time (I forgive you if you don't read my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/installing-android-sdk-windows-mac-and-linux-tutorial">I/O nerd articles</a>).</p><p>When everything is said and done we will have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">complete wrap-up of everything announced</a> as well as the gems that get hidden in the individual sessions. So will other Android websites, or general tech sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech" target="_blank">The Verge</a>.</p><p>Read all of those. If it sounds cool, read it twice, even. Then, be prepared to never see any of it materialize so that when some of it does happen, it's a pleasant surprise. Cynical, but healthy.</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, Google I/O isn't for you. Really, even the stuff about what's coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> isn't for you. On its surface, it is meant to get developers ready, but at its core, it's all done for the shareholders.</p><p>Like it or not, all businesses work this way, and Google isn't an exception. Every single decision has to start with "How does this affect share value?" or eventually there will be no decisions to make because there will be no Google to make them.</p><p>What Google has planned for its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel phones</a> is often cool as heck, and sometimes we even get to see some of it rub off on the software from other companies. If you <em>really</em> want to know about Android 16 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, for example, you should watch Samsung's developer conference.</p><p>Either way, hearing about it can be fun. Learning about it without sitting through the slog and trying to pay attention is even better.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Smartwatch charging is a mess, with a different proprietary cable for every brand. Lose your watch cable on a trip, and you're waiting a week for an expensive replacement or hoping a knock-off Amazon cable works. However, the fitness watch brand COROS has found a unique solution to the dilemma of charging cable for watches.</p><p>When COROS launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">PACE Pro watch</a>, it replaced its usual three-pin cable with a tiny USB-C dongle; you insert a USB-C cable into it, then plug the dongle's pins into your watch. This way, you don't need to keep a phone <em>and</em> watch charging cable on hand — just slide the dongle onto your phone cable every couple of weeks when the battery dies.</p><p>That "A2" dongle was PACE Pro-exclusive, but this new "USB-C to COROS A1 Charging Adapter" works with the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">PACE 3</a> and 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-review">APEX 2</a> and 2 Pro, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">VERTIX 2S</a> and 2. I also assume future COROS watches will match the A1 adapter, making it the universal option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="EquUBYynGwXpfU2PpfeU88" name="Coros-usb-c-adapter-plugged-into-pace-3-watch" alt="The USB-C to COROS A1 Charging Adapter with a USB-C cable plugged into it, plugged into a COROS PACE 3 smartwatch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EquUBYynGwXpfU2PpfeU88.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is still a "proprietary" charging solution, so you're screwed if you lose this tiny adapter; from experience, it's very easy for people to assume it's trash and toss it. Thankfully, COROS bundled it with a key ring holder so you can latch it onto a backpack and never lose track of it.</p><p>I'd love to see other fitness watch brands emulate COROS's approach. Garmin, Polar, Amazfit, Suunto, Fitbit, and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> brands each have unique connectors, so they'd each need their own adapters. But I'd still prefer a tiny, distinct adapter so that I can keep another (more useful) USB-C cable plugged into my charging brick at all times.</p><p>I suspect that we'll eventually see more watches adopt the Qi2 wireless charging instead, which would arguably be an even better "universal" charging option. But COROS piggybacking on the USB-C standard is the next best thing.</p>

<p>A couple of years back, I asked Jitesh Ubrani, IDC's research manager of worldwide device trackers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-charging-is-an-unsolvable-mess">why smartwatch charging is such an unsolvable mess</a> and whether the EU should step in for a universal standard, just as they forced Apple to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-usb-c-confirmed">drop Lightning for USB-C</a>.</p><p>He explained that "wearables come in far too many shapes and sizes" for a universal standard to make sense.</p><p>If every watch had to use a Qi charging coil, for example, it would "stifle innovation" and "do more harm than good," particularly to smaller brands that design their watches to prioritize other perks like larger batteries.</p><p>Ubrani said that wireless charging would become "more ubiquitous in the coming years as costs come down and power consumption amongst smartwatches is reduced." But fitness watch brands stick with the status quo because slower charging isn't a big deal when your watch lasts 1–3 weeks.</p><p>So, until that distant future when wireless charging makes sense to fitness brands, COROS's adapter is the next best thing.</p>

<p>At the moment, Apple and Galaxy Watches use magnetized wireless charging cables, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">leaked Pixel Watch 4 renders</a> suggest that Google will ditch its current pin-charging system for wireless charging. However, they don't follow a particular standard, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2 wireless charging</a>, so they're not interchangeable.</p><p>Switching between Android and iOS isn't particularly common, but it would be nice if all the mainline <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> and Apple Watches used interchangeable Qi2 chargers.</p><p>Qi2 supports fast wireless charging and a strong magnetized fit, making it less likely that your watch fails to charge because you didn't seat it properly. Plus, if you switch brands, your old charging cable doesn't suddenly become useless e-waste. Instead, it could charge other Qi-compliant devices.</p><p>Because these watches all use similar processors and hardware, I doubt it would be particularly onerous for any one brand to use an industry-standard charging coil. And because they only last a couple of days per charge, prioritizing faster charging is more important for these watches, anyway.</p><p>As long as using Qi2 wouldn't prevent watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> from hitting <em>faster</em> charging speeds, I don't see any downside to a more consistent universal watch standard. But since most brands would prefer the flexibility of their own unique charging solutions, I doubt will see this happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape.</p><p>This week saw some major leaks, Android 16's alleged redesign, Galaxy S25's launch date and full specs leak, U.K. residents get access to Google's digital IDs,  Samsung teases its new foldable, and Meta's Q1 earnings show major AI priority shift. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="android-16-s-ui-redesign-pops-up-in-a-leak-2">Android 16's UI redesign pops up in a leak</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:835px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.81%;"><img id="Bo4FVrk5YDhLtnTepV9Jya" name="android-16-lockscreen-redesign-leaked-look" alt="Android 16's code teases a lock screen redesign, that alters the clock font slightly and places the date/temp under it when there are no notifications." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bo4FVrk5YDhLtnTepV9Jya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="835" height="466" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>See all the UI changes </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-ui-icons-panel-redesign-leak"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This week gave us a first look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a>'s redesign and it comes from Mishaal Rahman. He seems to have stumbled on these UI changes while digging through Android 16's Beta 4. Rahman notices some changes to the shapes of app icons, stating that the OS could bring more "geometric" shape options, as well as the standard circle.</p><p>Rahman found choices like a square, a "four-sided cookie," and a "seven-sided cookie." Next up is the notification panel which could get a blurred/transparent user interface. The tiles within the panel also seem to have gotten a more rounded- bubble like appearance.</p><p>The lock screen also might get a fresh coat of paint. Rahman's snapshots show Google may alter the font of the clock while moving the date and temperature beneath it. If there are notifications, the clock will still move to the top left; however, the date/temp information will be featured on its right side, not under it.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-to-bring-a-dynamic-battery-indicator">battery icon may see a pop of color</a> as Google could ditch the old colorless icon for a horizontal battery with its percentage and a color-coded background.</p>

<p>NotebookLM's chatbot and research functions are now powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash, a thinking model with advanced reasoning techniques, Google announced today, May 2 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/NotebookLM/status/1918412708426244589" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). The company says the Gemini 2.5 Flash upgrade will only impact <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM</a>'s chatbot and Q&A modes, leaving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-new-features-canvas-audio-overviews">Audio Overviews</a> unchanged.</p><p>"It's been a busy week for us. SO busy that we forgot to mention that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/NotebookLM">@NotebookLM </a>is officially powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash," the official NotebookLM account posted on X (formerly Twitter).  "The 2.5 models are thinking models, so you should start to see more comprehensive answers, particularly to complex, multi-step reasoning questions."</p><p>The move comes after Google announced that NotebookLM's Audio Overviews are now available in over 50 languages earlier this week in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-audio-overviews-50-languages/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The change also added an <strong>Output Language</strong> setting for Audio Overviews that can be separate from your default language, which can be helpful for bilingual and multilingual research and studying.</p>

<p>The last time I checked, there were at least 35 different smart home devices strewn around my house. Most of them are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-work-google-home">smart lights</a> or streaming devices, but I also have a variety of smart speakers, displays, and other devices. Not to mention a few smart cameras that we use to keep an eye on the house and its surroundings if we're gone for more than a few hours.</p><p>The problem is that everything that I've mentioned is controlled by a different app or service. I've tried my best to keep things as tidy as possible, such as relying on Philips Hue for smart light bulbs and a couple of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-security-cameras-store-locally-not-cloud">Nest Cams</a> to monitor the outside of my home.</p><p>However, while I'm okay with having a bunch of different apps installed on my phone, my wife isn't. Every new platform means getting her set up and logged in, then keeping my fingers crossed that everything works the way it's supposed to.</p><p>Recently, I finally said that enough was enough and decided that it was time to dive into Home Assistant. See, I've actually had a Home Assistant instance set up on an old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi 4</a> for some time, but I've just been too <del>lazy</del> busy to take the time and finish getting everything set up.</p>
<h2 id="nest-homekit-alexa-matter-and-more-2">Nest, HomeKit, Alexa, Matter, and more </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3164px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="PtjMw8FscsSFaDoaCPSHN8" name="Smart-Home-devices-Matter-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Smart home devices and Matter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PtjMw8FscsSFaDoaCPSHN8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3164" height="1780" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The promise of Home Assistant is that it can act as the central hub for practically any smart device in your abode. And when I say "smart device," I mean almost anything that connects to the internet in some capacity. In addition to that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whats-home-assistant-and-why-should-home-automation-enthusiasts-consider-it">Home Assistant</a> works with various "protocols" such as Matter, Thread, Zigbee, HomeKit, Nest, etc.</p><p>While improvements have been made to improve multi-protocol integration, none of them have managed to make good on the promise of a seamless smart home. Plus, the only company that seems to even care about releasing new products on a semi-regular cadence has been Amazon. Google's too wrapped up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-switch-from-google-assistant-to-gemini-might-kill-nest-speakers-and-displays">phasing out Assistan</a>t in favor of Gemini, while Apple is content with living inside the Vision Pro.</p>
<h2 id="installing-home-assistant-is-as-easy-2">Installing Home Assistant is as easy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="58rNzfVoMHP9DHtDVy82JH" name="home-assistant-setup-cli.jpg" alt="Home Assistant setup CLI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/58rNzfVoMHP9DHtDVy82JH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for getting started, you have a few different options. The easiest of which is to just pick up the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXVKSG19">Home Assistant Green</a>," offering a plug-and-play solution, as you just need to plug in the power and Ethernet to get started. However, if you're willing to do a bit of tinkering, you can install Home Assistant yourself on a single-board computer (SBC), like the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Or, you can spin up a Virtual Machine on your computer and install it that way. Seriously, there are even more methods, which go to show just how versatile this service really is. No matter what you install Home Assistant on, just make sure it has a constant network connection, otherwise, it'll only work when your computer is turned on.</p><p>As I said before, I have Home Assistant running on a Raspberry Pi that is connected directly to my router. More specifically, I'm actually running the Home Assistant Operating System, as it gives me the flexibility to install and use more integrations than the standard installation would. However, if you're just dipping your toes in the water, I'd recommend either <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/">HA Container or Core</a>.</p>
<h2 id="there-s-so-much-that-you-can-do-2">There's so much that you can do</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6547px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eDuRyAi5FvDenq7Pz6Vn65" name="lenovo-tab-m10-plus-home-assistant-dashboard-2.jpg" alt="Home Assistant Dashboard on Lenovo Tab M10 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eDuRyAi5FvDenq7Pz6Vn65.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6547" height="3683" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once Home Assistant is running, you're presented with a pretty basic-looking home page, but that's kind of the point. It's not just a way of tying all of your smart home devices together. But it can consolidate all of the switches, toggles, and controls into a single location, removing the headache of flipping through pages of apps.</p><p>But wait! There's more!</p><p>Say you prefer the way that the Google Home app works, but obviously, you couldn't integrate a certain platform. This can solve that problem too! With a bit of time and patience, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.home-assistant.io/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> and the built-in Voice Assistant feature allow you to "expose entities" so that those incompatible devices will now appear within the Home app. <em>And</em> after the add-on is set up, you're able to control even Apple HomeKit devices using Assistant or Alexa.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="T9xVNfnoPaXAJVDxEXYhn5" name="home-assistant-cloud-features" alt="Home Assistant cloud features overview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T9xVNfnoPaXAJVDxEXYhn5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2270" height="1276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Home Assistant)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The beauty is that this can be something quick that remedies a few pain points, or it can be a weekend project that doesn't really ever end. There are some pretty awesome integrations, such as tracking your Amazon deliveries, setting up a presence-based automation, and even turning your computer on.</p><p>Even after getting everything connected, you can enhance the experience even further by creating a custom dashboard. Some have even gone so far as to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/search/?q=kindle&cId=71a7f272-fe93-425c-a1c4-c9456055323c&iId=bcf6a2fa-3196-4f18-be9f-37bbb6c58545">turn an old Kindle</a> into a basic smart screen that shows the weather and upcoming calendar events, mounted on the wall.</p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1kbdip6/boyfriend_introduced_me_to_home_assistant_around/#lightbox"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="AsHkhbMFowsFoCLhmnTp2R" name="home-assistant-dashboard-kindle-reddit" alt="Home Assistant running on an Amazon Kindle as a dashboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AsHkhbMFowsFoCLhmnTp2R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4310" height="2426" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: r/homeassistant)</span></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>So if you prefer a more traditional platform like Google Home or Amazon Alexa, you've just supercharged it. But Home Assistant is right there for those who want a truly customizable experience with more built-in functionality than you'll find anywhere else. It provides exactly what we were hoping to see from Matter, but goes further than we could have even thought.</p>

<p>With the recent news about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/im-done-buying-google-nest-products">Google dropping support</a> for the first two Nest Thermostats, paired with very few new product releases, you might be looking outside of the Nest ecosystem. Well, thanks to Home Assistant, it doesn't mean that you'll be left to figure out how to use a completely different app.</p><p>On top of that, the release of Android 14 introduced the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-change-lock-screen-shortcuts-android-14">customize your lock screen shortcuts</a>, meaning that you can replace the Google Home app on your phone with, oh, I don't know, maybe the Home Assistant app. Which is exactly what I've done on both my docked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, and I couldn't be happier. There's even a Home Assistant app for Wear OS, which is really just icing on the cake at this point.</p><p>If you're ready to venture down this rabbit hole, keep things simple, read the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/">documentation</a>, connect the basics, and explore the interface. Once you have a better grasp on what's possible, then let your inner tinkerer run wild and have some fun with it. Just keep in mind that Rome wasn't built in a day, and chances are, neither will your new smart home experience.</p>

<ul><li>One UI 7 update is causing significant battery drain for Samsung Galaxy S24 and Z Fold 6 users.</li><li>Users are experiencing rapid battery drain even during periods when the phone is not in use, requiring frequent charging.</li><li>Some workarounds include clearing cache or waiting a week for usage pattern learning.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Several people have taken to Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s24-series/battery-draining-faster-after-one-ui-7-update/td-p/12117659/page/3">forums</a> and Reddit to report significant battery drain issues that are supposedly triggered by the new One UI 7 update. This has been seen specifically by Samsung Galaxy S24 series owners as well as some with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 (first spotted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/one-ui-7-triggers-battery-life-crisis-galaxy-s24-fold-6/"> Android Police</a>).</p><p>One UI 7 started<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsungs-one-ui-7-finally-resumes-again-expanding-to-more-regions-including-india"> rolling out</a> more widely over the past couple of days after several delays and even a brief pause of the rollout by the company due to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/serious-bug-pushes-samsung-to-stall-one-ui-7-rollout-globally">'serious bug.'</a> However, the problems don't seem to end with this UI.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Fold 6 </a>user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1kcr4l1/battery_life_got_worse_with_the_latest_ui7_update/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> said that their battery capacity was basically cut by half following the One UI 7 update: "I now end the day with just 20%-25% battery, down from 45-50% before upgrading," they said.</p>

<p>The story remains the same with some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra </a>users as well. They saw a huge drop in battery life since installing One UI 7. They stated that they lost close to 20% battery while the phone wasn't in use in less than three hours. Additionally, they're having to plug their phones in for charging more often than not.</p><p>While Samsung hasn't mentioned any such issues with the OS, some users suggest that clearing up cache could help the sitution, while others say that it is common for phones to act out during the first few days of the update. This could be because the device is leaning the user's usage pattern following the upgrade to One UI 7.</p><p>So the suggestion is to give your phone at least a week to settle in, before looking for ways to fix the battery issue. That said, if all else fails and you've passed the seven day mark, other users suggest factory resetting the device. While this sounds like a harsh workaround, it seems to have done the trick for many.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Samsung about this and will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google TV recently detailed a few ways it's revamping its setup experience for users to get them into their shows and movies quicker.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/setup-new-google-tv-improvements/">Keyword post</a>, Google's product update says its new setup experience is "faster and easier" for users. This experience brings a handful of changes, but most notably, Google says users can "start watching right away." Google TV's upgraded setup brings "improved app installs," meaning you won't have to wait around for a while as your device prepares.</p><p>Additionally, Google says this upgraded app install method should give users more peace of mind when worrying about their TVs' onboard storage.</p><p>The post states users won't need to download an app to get their Google TV started. Now, during its initial setup, your Android phone will display a notification, which states "Set up your Google TV." Those on iOS will have to scan the on-screen QR code. Moreover, consumers can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/15158065?hl=en">connect eligible smart devices</a> to their Google TV much quicker than before.</p><p>Certain devices, like Google Home speakers, will let users pause their content, search for shows/movies, and more. Lastly, users can "customize" their TV with unique screensavers, parental controls, and individual profiles.</p><p>Google TV concludes by specifying that this new setup experience is "first available" for Hisense’s 2025 U7 series and 2025 U8 series. The company plans to expand coverage to other Google TVs and "select" Onn. streaming products from Walmart "later this year."</p>

<p>Shortly after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">Google TV Streamer</a> launched, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">rolled out an update</a> for Google TV devices. The patch aimed to give users more awareness and control when it came to their home and entertainment. The main highlight was the addition of the "Home Panel," a side-view packed with all of your connected smart home device information and cameras. Users could easily see who was at their door and check on other areas in or around the home without leaving the TV.</p><p>Additionally, the Home Panel on Google TV lets users control their lights and temperature for a complete control center. The experience further progressed with Google's new Sports tab on the "For You" page. The tab was designed to highlight "relevant" sports games, as well as YouTube Highlights.</p><p>While the TV Streamer is the official replacement of the Chromecast, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast/chromecast-with-google-tv-home-panel-feature-rollout">still rolled out a major update for it</a>. At the end of April, the Chromecast with Google TV dongle received the Home Panel update, bringing much of the smart home connectivity the TV Streamer and Google TV devices have.</p>

<p>Boox appears to be on a product-launching spree. After recently dropping portable e-readers, the company now has a new E Ink monitor dubbed Mira Pro (Color Version), which is now available to purchase.</p><p>It is a 25.3-inch monitor that claims to have paper-like visuals alongside rich colors. The latest monitor is aimed at professionals, programmers, students, and those who spend a lot of time on screens, as it offers an eye-friendly design.</p>

<p>The Mira Pro (Color Version) happens to be the first color monitor and an upgrade over the monochrome Mira Pro. It also features the Kaleidoscope 3 — the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/kobo-libra-colour-review">Kobo Libra Color</a> — color ePaper screen that claims to offer soft colors, which should work for tasks demanding color differentiation like “reviewing color-coded dashboards, analyzing data, or working with complex graphics.” The same screen was featured in the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox/boox-introduces-new-go-7-series-of-portable-ereaders">Boox Go Color 7 e-reader</a>.</p><p>The massive 25.3-inch can be used as a primary or secondary screen and supports split-screen multitasking. Then there’s adjustable dual-tone front lights to ensure readability in all lighting conditions and further making it eye-friendly.</p><p>The monitor further utilizes Boox Super Refresh technology that increases refresh rates alongside having four preset refresh modes. “The Mira software allows further fine-tuning of Refresh Speed, Dark Color Enhancement, and Light Color Filter for truly customized viewing.”</p>

<ul><li>Rumors suggest there are new Google One AI subscription tiers in the works for consumers.</li><li>These tiers could include a "Gemini Pro" and "Gemini Ultra" plan for consumers, alongside the pre-existing Gemini Advanced option.</li><li>Google recently upgraded Gemini Advanced with NotebookLM Plus and Veo 2 for video generation, but the company also teased more for I/O 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reports suggest Google is preparing to introduce a couple of new AI subscription plans for Gemini.</p><p>Speculation stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.testingcatalog.com/google-prepares-new-gemini-ai-subscription-tiers-with-possible-gemini-ultra-plan/">TestingCatalog</a>, which highlights the findings from a few tipsters on X. According to their discoveries, Google's Gemini code seems to suggest plans for the addition of two new Google One AI subscription tiers. Rumors claim the company could introduce a "Gemini Pro" and "Gemini Ultra" tier in addition to the pre-existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">Gemini Advanced</a> bundle.</p><p>While Gemini's code seemingly points to this, tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BartokGabi17/status/1917680002319147308">BartokGabi17</a> was able to surface an early preview of the Pro's limitations.</p><p>The post on X showcased a snapshot of an in-app pop-up that read, "You've reached your limit of generated videos." It also encourages the user to either wait for the next month to roll in or "upgrade to Gemini Ultra."</p><p>The publication reiterated a previous claim that Google was developing new "Premium AI Plus" and "Premium AI Pro" plans. With how things have seemingly progressed, there's a chance Google could rename these to better fit with what consumers already know.</p>

<p>The reported tagline about a "monthly limit" for video generation echoes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-2-video-generator-gemini-advanced-whisk-rollout">an update to Gemini Advanced</a> that brought Veo 2. Google warned Advanced subscribers that they wouldn't be able to infinitely produce Veo 2's short, high-quality video clips with Gemini. However, the company didn't state what the ceiling looks like. Instead, Google says Gemini would let you know when you were approaching your limit.</p><p>It will appear as a pop-up, similar to what was found in the latest AI subscription tier leak.</p><p>In other news, Google One's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-ai-premium-plan-just-got-more-appealing-with-new-perks">AI Premium plan was upgraded</a>, giving users a little more bang for their buck. Existing subscribers were granted access to NotebookLM Plus at no extra charge. The update also gives consumers access to Gemini Advance's smarts in Gmail and Docs, alongside 2TB of cloud storage. With so much going on with Gemini — rumors of a "Pro" and "Ultra" tier, too — I/O 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-io-2025-newsletter-teasers">could have more in store</a> than we realize.</p><p>Google recently teased "new possibilities" inbound for Gemini in a newsletter. While it refused to go into detail, the teaser claimed these new updates would help enhance user "productivity," as well as introduce new "interactions." Of course, this could allude to new additions to the Gemini app and browser experience, but there's a chance more could be announced.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has announced the start of its "Open Enrollment" period for Galaxy devices in the U.S.</li><li>Users can enroll their device in the Samsung Care Plus with Theft & Loss protection plan, which offers screen and glass back repairs for $0.</li><li>The period is open from May 1 to June 15, but it's only available for the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, S25 Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip 6, Fold 6, Tab S10 Plus, and Tab S10 Ultra</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's reportedly feeling a little generous as reports state the company is giving Galaxy owners a new shot at its device protection plan.</p><p>The Korean OEM has started the "Open Enrollment" period for Galaxy owners interested in grabbing Samsung Care Plus, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/us-galaxy-device-owners-get-another-shot-at-care-protection/">SamMobile</a>. This enrollment period reportedly only concerns consumers in the U.S., delivering Care Plus with Theft & Loss protection.</p><p>Samsung highlights this on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rg2.samsungcareplus.com/us#/">protection plan's website</a>, stating those enrolling will receive "same-day" cracked screen and glass back repairs for $0.</p><p>At its core, Samsung Care Plus with Theft & Loss provides users with "unlimited drops, spills, and mechanical breakdown" coverage. If your Galaxy device has received damage, Samsung will carry out these repairs at one of its authorized locations. Breakdowns and repairs also include batteries.</p><p>More importantly, Samsung's fine print states this Open Enrollment period isn't available for <em>every </em>Galaxy device. According to the company, consumers with a Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, Fold 6, Tab S10 Plus, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a> can participate. You can attempt to enroll your Galaxy device through the website or, on your phone/tablet, head to <strong>Settings > About Phone > Samsung Care Plus </strong>to check the service's availability.</p><p>This enrollment period is open from May 1 to June 15.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-care-plus-theft-and-loss-unlimited-screen-repair-announcement">recently upgraded</a> its Care Plus protection experience in January when it introduced "same-day $0 cracked screen and back glass repairs." This particular brand of device safety regarded consumers who purchased its plan's unlimited subscription. Moreover, Samsung warned users that its same-day modifier may only be available for eligible devices in "select" areas.</p><p>Likely, this is still the case, no matter Samsung's brief second chance enrollment period.</p><p>What happened earlier this year was the second major Samsung Care Plus update, after the company brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-care-plus-unlimited-battery-repair-notification">unlimited battery repair support</a> in 2024. Eligible consumers were those with Samsung Care Plus with Loss and Theft or the standard Care Plus plan. The specifics state that your battery is eligible for repair/replacement if it can no longer charge above 79%.</p><p>However, if your battery's suffered "additional damage," it will void the chance of repair.</p>

                    <p><p>Samsung offers a little more with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The phone features a redesigned frame with slimmer bezels and improved camera technology. However, you're still getting the same large, top-tier flagship phone you're accustomed to. The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a 6.9-inch display with 1TB of maximum storage, and a 5,000mAh battery.</p></p>
