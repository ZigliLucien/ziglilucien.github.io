After a lengthy rollout period for the Android 15-based One UI 7 update, Samsung has already begun beta testing the upcoming One UI 8 operating system. If you have an eligible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> smartphone, you can try the Android 16-based update right now.</p><p>In fact, the second One UI 8 beta update has already arrived for early testers, and development is actively progressing.

However, that "beta" moniker does mean that users will be sure to encounter bugs and instability while testing this pre-release version of One UI 8.</p><p>It's important to remember that there's no easy way to revert to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> after installing the One UI 8 beta without erasing your entire smartphone.

At a rumored 3.9mm thin when unfolded, it makes the 5.6mm Z Fold 6 look like a chonker. However, it also raises a few simple questions, such as: how would Samsung achieve this without making big sacrifices, particularly in the camera performance?</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>Aside from a thinner phone, one of the biggest requests from Z Fold users has been for Samsung to improve the cameras. Galaxy Z Fold phones have never had <em>bad</em> cameras, but there's never been a Z Fold that could outperform the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phones</a>. This has long been a perplexing problem, given that the Z Fold costs nearly $2,000 and has never been "thin," but can Samsung really make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> thin <em>and</em> give it an award-winning camera?</p><p>Yes, absolutely, and two other ultra-thin foldables are proof. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">review of the Oppo Find N5</a>, which is currently the thinnest phone in the world <em>and</em> a book style foldable like the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Harish said "the cameras on the Find N5 are better than the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9, and that's a big deal in and of itself." Even Samsung's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> with its 200MP camera sensor proves it's possible.</p><p>Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-big-charger-upgrade-databse-listing-rumor">the upcoming Honor Magic V5</a> is set to be the most direct competitor to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and is said to be at least as thin as Samsung's phone, I thought it would be fun to take last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> and test its cameras against the best flagship cameras of 2025. The results show that Samsung can deliver a truly stunning flagship camera experience on its upcoming ultra-thin foldable if it really wants to.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-primary-cameras"><span>Honor Magic V3: Primary cameras</span></h2><p>The Honor Magic V3 comes in at 4.4mm thin unfolded and sports a sizable camera island around back with a 50MP main sensor.

I prefer Samsung's tuning in that arena, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">OnePlus 13</a> is normally quite spot on with color science on the ultrawide camera.

In the 10x shots, you can tell the Magic V3's shot is slightly softer, but on its own, I doubt anyone would notice this. The telephoto camera is quite good and does a great job of zooming in on things.

The music streaming service initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-music-tests-new-spotify-like-lyrics-sharing-feature">began testing lyric sharing in April 2025</a>, but the tool is now widely rolling out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> users as of today, June 17 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/17/youtube-music-lyrics-sharing-2/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It's available on version 8.24 of the YouTube Music app for iOS and Android.</p><p>With lyric sharing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> users can create a shareable card with a few lines of lyrics from the song they're currently listening to. When available, the feature adds a new floating action button to the Lyrics tab of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-musics-now-playing-controls-are-moved-around-in-latest-test">Now Playing user-interface</a> called <strong>Share</strong>. After tapping it, you can select which groupings of lyric lines you'd like to use to create the shareable card.</p><p>You can pick the background color of your lyric card, and continuing will create the finalized graphic. It'll show the song title, artist, album artwork, selected lyrics, and a subtle YouTube Music logo. It's essentially creating an image that can be saved to your device's camera roll or shared with other apps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ssQX6ejwEyPoQws95GmhRX" name="YouTube-Music-Lyric-Sharing" alt="The new lyric sharing feature in YouTube Music." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssQX6ejwEyPoQws95GmhRX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since the feature simply shares an image of your lyric card, you'll need to manually add audio to lyrics shared on your social accounts. For instance, if you wanted to add YouTube Music lyrics to your Instagram story, you'll still need to select a track for your story as you normally would in order for music to play. Otherwise, it'll only take a few taps to create and share a YouTube Music lyrics card.</p><p>Lyric sharing is available for both free and paid YouTube Music accounts running the latest version of the mobile app (version 8.24 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-music/id1017492454" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>).</p><p>The YouTube Music app was last updated yesterday, June 16, on both iOS and Android. However, this seems like a server-side change, so force stop your YouTube Music app if you aren't able to create lyric cards yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thanks to Google, Luma AI, and Pika, users will find convenient text-to-video generation capabilities, which can be placed right into a Board. Additionally, users can now utilize Firefly Boards' AI to make "iterative edits" to images. This is done via simple text prompts. You tell the AI what you'd like to change and watch it come to life.</p><p>Lastly, Adobe is rolling out some QoL updates, such as one-click arrange. The post states users can now "instantly" arrange the content in their Board to be more presentable. "Linked Docs" is another feature that arrives, giving users the option to link their Adobe documents in Boards.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The original poster (OP) showed the platform's latest alleged attempts to dissuade users from using ad blockers, which is to "throttle" their watching experience. The user posted a snapshot of an "Experiencing interruptions? Find out why" button that appears when clicking on a video.</p><p>Many users confirm that this interruption button only appears when they have an ad blocker active.</p><p>One user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1l8oq5y/comment/mx6a49i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">offered their experience</a>, stating the video "takes a couple of seconds to load as if my bandwidth is insufficient." There is a small bit of "lag," you could say, from when you click on the video to when it begins. The player remains black for a few moments, as if you were waiting for a skippable ad to play through (normally). Furthering user suspicions about YouTube's motive is the "Find out why" link.</p><p>YouTube is sending users to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3037019#zippy=%2Ccheck-your-extensions-including-ad-blockers">Google support page</a> that says interruptions might be caused by your extensions, such as an ad blocker.</p><h2 id="the-fight-against-ad-blockers-2">The Fight against Ad Blockers</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1l8oq5y/theyre_slowing_down_performance_if_you_use_an">They're slowing down performance if you use an adblocker</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube">r/youtube</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>There was some speculation that YouTube rolled out this cheeky way of combating ad-block users to accounts that typically use them. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1l8oq5y/comment/mxcignl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">subsequent reports</a> state this tactic has since hit non-logged-in users with ad blockers enabled.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to YouTube about these slowdown reports. We will update this article if we hear back.</p><p>YouTube's been targeting ad blockers on its platform for a few years now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-loads-slower-on-firefox#section-update">and the idea of "slowdowns" or throttling attempts</a> is nothing new if it's actively doing so again. Users previously reported slower video experiences on YouTube in 2023, which the platform confirmed was part of its anti-adblock crusade. Some users thought it was restricted to a couple of browsers, but a Google update made it clear that YouTube had every browser with ad block enabled in its sights.</p><p>As always, YouTube remains consistent in its crusade's purpose, stating, "To support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favorite content on YouTube, we’ve launched an effort to urge viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> for an ad free experience" back in 2023.</p><p>Users might also be familiar with another tactic YouTube deployed, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-global-efforts-clock-ad-blockers">would block streaming access to its platform</a> after its system flagged your ad blocker a few times.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, the company is ready to make the stable versions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash</a> available to the public, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-model-family-expands/" target="_blank">announced</a> today. They are now generally available to users in the Gemini app, as well as in the Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.</p><p>Alongside these announcements, Google also introduced Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite today, June 17. The preview version of Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is now available for testing, and it’s a newer alternative to Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, which was made public earlier this year. Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is “our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet,” according to Google.</p><p>Compared to the other Gemini 2.5 models, the Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite preview is all about efficiency and cost-cutting. While it doesn’t perform as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro or Flash, it still holds its own in benchmark tests. It’s also significantly cheaper to run compared to the better Gemini 2.5 models, which could be appealing to developers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1022px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.41%;"><img id="Pu5z2UgPhQRpnaUVn782Rm" name="Gemini-25-Flash-Lite" alt="Benchmark test results for the Gemini 2.5 family." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pu5z2UgPhQRpnaUVn782Rm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1022" height="1108" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google )</span></figcaption></figure><p>“2.5 Flash Lite has all-around higher quality than 2.0 Flash-Lite on coding, math, science, reasoning and multimodal benchmarks,” the company explains in the blog post. “It excels at high-volume, latency-sensitive tasks like translation and classification, with lower latency than 2.0 Flash-Lite and 2.0 Flash on a broad sample of prompts.”</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite still has a one-million-token context window and multimodal input, and can integrate with services like Google Search or execute code. It’ll also support thinking budgets, so you can turn on thinking without wasting tokens.</p><p>You can try out the preview for Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite now in the Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.

Now, Spotify has made it way easier with a “Download to other device” option right from your phone, so you can skip the watch-tapping hassle and send your tunes over without breaking a sweat.</p><h2 id="push-music-anywhere-2">Push music anywhere</h2><p>Few things kill the vibe of a good walk or run like realizing you missed downloading your go-to playlist. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify">Spotify</a>’s new feature wipes out that problem because now you can queue up music anytime, even if your watch or other device isn’t nearby.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="hsGdzXcqjvRj7WgwPZP8TL" name="Spotify-manage-downloads-feature" alt="manage downloads feature on Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hsGdzXcqjvRj7WgwPZP8TL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="SP6Kw68S8YdUtoq3P2fJTL" name="Spotify-manage-downloads-feature" alt="manage downloads feature on Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SP6Kw68S8YdUtoq3P2fJTL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>At the same time, Spotify is fine-tuning how you manage downloads across your devices. Now, you can easily oversee and organize your music library on up to five devices, all from the Spotify app on your main phone. It’s a smarter way to keep your tunes in check without hopping between devices.</p><p>Once you hit the "Manage Downloads" button in the options menu, you’ll instantly see which devices have that playlist saved offline. It’s a slick way to keep tabs on what’s eating up your five-device limit, and you can even clear out downloads right then and there.</p><p>SamMobile reports that this feature is already live on Samsung devices running One UI 7 and Galaxy Watches with Wear OS 5.0. Spotify is rolling it out slowly, so not everyone will see it immediately, but it’s definitely on the way.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It gives us a clear look at two buttons on one side, flanking a smaller orange button, also rumored to be the "Quick" button, possibly giving users access to apps that they use often. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/massive-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leak-all-but-confirms-its-squircle-look">Previous leaks </a>suggest that the Classic variant will supposedly arrive in a single size (47mm), with a 1.5-inch display, and will have a 450mAh battery capacity.</p><p>As for the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025), as the tipster calls it, it could show up in a deep blue colorway with a smoother silver bezel surrounding the dial. It remains unclear if this watch will have a rotating bezel, as it seems to have a much smoother outer bezel without the ridges. The renders show the watch will possess the same two physical buttons seen on the other two models and an additional smaller orange button on one side.</p><p>While these are still leaks and need to be taken with a grain of salt, the Galaxy Watch 8 series is expected to debut later this summer during Samsung's Unpacked, which<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york"> isn't too far away</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

That's a much taller order.</p><p>Here's everything I pieced together from AWE 2025 panels about how AR glasses will evolve over the next few years — including the ways that Meta and Google, in particular, see AR glasses' future very differently.</p><h2 id="ar-glasses-don-t-have-one-clear-blueprint-for-success-like-smart-glasses-2">AR glasses don't have one clear blueprint for success like smart glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aZXYMqr7g7kFJmWmfHJxMN" name="AWE-2025-smart-glasses-panel" alt="A stage with four XR panelists sitting in armchairs atop a stage at AWE 2025, with Long Beach artwork on the large screen behind them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZXYMqr7g7kFJmWmfHJxMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Meta's Kelly Ingham, Lenovo's Jason McGuigan, and XREAL's Ralph Jodice at AWE 2025 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During her panel "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awexr.com/usa-2025/agenda/1242">State of Smart Glasses and What's Around the Corner</a>," Meta VP of AR Devices Kelly Ingham addressed the obvious challenges facing AR glasses today.</p><p>"Displays are still heavy, right? How do you put a display in front of your eyes and have it be comfortable?" she asked rhetorically. "Is it monocular, or is it binocular? You add more weight, you add more cost."</p><p>XREAL's Ralph Jodice, whose company recently made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-android-xr-glasses-project-aura-meta-orion-similar">Android XR-powered AR glasses</a>, noted that while they've successfully grown FoV from 30º to 57º in the last couple years and will soon hit 70º, their customers aren't satisfied. The main demand is "Make my FoV wider, make my glasses smaller," and doing both is an obvious "challenge."</p><p>Ingham concluded that there will be a "broad set of categories" for AR glasses, from 30-degree displays for notification windows to 70-degree displays for full-on entertainment, and from cloud-based AI through your phone to a "full computer on your head." There's no one set path to success.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="W6EgH5xGaqqG9hK55NxL9N" name="AWE-2025-AR-mass-market-panel" alt="A stage at AWE 2025 with a moderator at the podium and three XR executives from Google, Meta, and Qualcomm seated next to him on stage." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W6EgH5xGaqqG9hK55NxL9N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google's Bernard Kress, Meta's Edgar Auslander, and Qualcomm's Said Bakadir at AWE 2025 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bernard Kress, Director of Google AR, made a similar point in the aforementioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awexr.com/usa-2025/agenda/1252">panel</a> on mass market adoption of AR. He described a range of potential AR "market segments":</p><ul><li>Monocolor AR glasses with basic, subtle text function</li><li>Full-color single-display glasses like the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google AR prototype</a></li><li>Binocular, full FoV glasses like <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> or Snap Spectacles with higher power demands and "bigger form factors"</li><li>Affordable "smart goggles" like <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">XREAL One</a> that don't need to "look like regular glasses"</li><li>Full optical see-through (OST) headsets like the Hololens</li></ul><p>What Kress didn't say is that this nebulousness makes it very difficult to imagine AR glasses' future, because it's far too complicated for non-techies to understand.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">Smart glasses</a> also have a range of form factors. But most people will see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> as the template for smart glasses: built-in speakers and cameras, AI assistance, and phone connectivity in a "normal" glasses design.</p><p>We'll see a wider range of looks with the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Oakley Meta glasses</a> or Android XR glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-glasses-coming-designed-by-gentle-monster-warby-parker">designed by Warby Parker and Gentle Monster</a>, but the core experience should be consistent and appealing to everyday folks.</p><h2 id="google-thinks-ar-needs-a-killer-app-first-to-succeed-2">Google thinks AR needs a killer app first to succeed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ" name="Android-XR-Maps-2" alt="A still from an Android XR example video of how the software will work on smart glasses, showing someone navigating city streets with Google Maps, with a map view holograph showing when to turn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During the mass-market AR panel, the moderator asked Google's Kress and reps from Meta and Qualcomm, "Do smart glasses have to have a display to be AR?"</p><p>"I would say, 'Not necessarily,'" responded Edgar Auslander, a Senior Director at Meta. As long as your "reality is augmented," it could be audio, visual, or any other sensory changes. By that definition, Meta AI glasses are "AR glasses," which is questionable.</p><p>Kress took a different perspective. For him, AR glasses must have a display, but must also offer "something that cannot be replaced by audio." Multimodal AI — the killer app for smart glasses that analyzes what you see — might benefit from a display, but it already works without one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GUVm5y3P7RJDihk9ZwmH59" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-6" alt="Michael Hicks wearing Android XR prototype glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUVm5y3P7RJDihk9ZwmH59.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google's Android XR prototype glasses </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Kress, who worked on the original Google Glass, explained that once the novelty wore off, consumers had "no real use for it." That's why Glass transitioned to enterprise, where developers could get clear "return on investment (ROI)" in areas like automotive, avionics, surgery, and architecture.</p><p>So what will change with AR glasses now? Kress believes the visual component only becomes necessary when you can achieve "World Locking," where 6DoF tracking and a visual positioning system let glasses accurately point to a specific, physical element of your world. Right now, the Android XR UI can only hover in empty space.</p><p>You also need affordable, power-efficient microLEDs to display the data clearly and efficiently, Kress noted. But software is the key. It's an unsurprising perspective from a Google engineer, given the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">focus on Android XR</a> while leaving hardware to Samsung and others.</p><h2 id="meta-if-they-build-ar-hardware-consumers-will-come-2">Meta: If they build AR hardware, consumers will come</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9Wg6WCfF6F7nr2A7ddcicT" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Limited-Edition-2" alt="Ray-Ban Meta limited edition transparent smart glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Wg6WCfF6F7nr2A7ddcicT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta's Ingham had a more hardware- and economic-driven perspective on AR glasses' future: Smart glasses need to become mainstream first, or AR glasses have no chance.</p><p>Meta has sold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">two million smart glasses</a>, and total glasses sales "better be in double digits" — meaning tens of millions — by 2027, Ingham says, or that's a warning sign for the category.</p><p>She explained how OEMs like Apple and Google need to join Meta with consumer smart glasses to make retailers like Best Buy and Target treat smart glasses as a "whole category." They'll then "start pushing these products" with more aggressive marketing on consumers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XcCDqRySKCcJL7r8rp3Wi5" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-01.jpg" alt="Photo of Nick Sutrich wearing and using the Meta Orion AR glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XcCDqRySKCcJL7r8rp3Wi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once consumers adopt AI glasses en masse and "have been trained" with audio AI interfaces, Ingham argues, they'll "start expecting more," priming them for more powerful AR glasses.

And they're improving smart glasses' pain points like weight, audio quality, more variety of styles (especially for women), and a lower cost.</p><p>The one obvious pain point she ignored was battery life, and I found that telling. No one at AWE could really give a clear answer on how full-fledged AR glasses will ever be petite enough to appeal to mainstream consumers <em>and</em> have the battery life to last all day.</p><h2 id="should-ar-hardware-or-software-come-first-google-and-meta-fundamentally-disagree-2">Should AR hardware or software come first?

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Faster-smoother-camera-timeline/ba-p/722288">community update</a>, Google states v3.33 of the app is rolling out now on Android and will address the laggy and, at times, low FPS experience that its camera timeline previously suffered. Specifically, Google says v3.33 "substantially improved" the framerate and loading performance for users.</p><p>Now, users scrolling through the camera timeline to view old events <em>should </em>find an easier, smoother time. The improvements made to scrubbing through the video's timeline should make it easier for users to spot anything of importance, as the old laggy experience might've made this difficult.</p><p>Google adds that this update cuts down on timeline loading times and "frozen" moments.</p><p>The Home app update also brings a "limited access member tier." In short, homeowners can "invite" people into their smart home ecosystem at a "level" that works for them. You can decide what others can see, do, or set, such as automations, and more.</p><h2 id="continued-smart-home-improvement-2">Continued (Smart) Home Improvement</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RhYdgjdYgJhyLt97hqUVtd" name="google-household-routines.jpg" alt="Google Household routines" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RhYdgjdYgJhyLt97hqUVtd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15962877?visit_id=638856992571964960-3895140438&p=app_release_notes&rd=1">fully detailed patch notes</a> for v3.33 include the following bug fixes.

The company kick-started a limited test for its "Home Summary" widget. The widget delivers a quick roundup of happenings around your home while you were away. The app will state if a package was delivered, if a smart device's routine started, and any automated changes to your thermostat.</p><p>A small group of Pixel users were brought into this test ahead of its release (whenever Google's done).</p><p>On the other hand, Gemini was brought into the app to give users strong routine creation capabilities.

What's immediately highlighted is the company's use of a 1-3-4 core architecture for the supposed Dimensity 9500 SoC. The listing claims the chip possesses a single core at 3.23GHz, which is surprising, but there may be a reason for this.</p><p>The Geekbench listing adds that the Dimensity 9500 contains three cores clocked at 3.03GHz and four cores at 2.23GHz.</p><p>After taking the platform's CL benchmark test, the chip allegedly received a score of 15,717.</p><p>Moreover, a comment on the tipster's thread on X highlights a new development: the existence of a Mali-G1-Ultra GPU. It appears that this GPU is from Arm; however, it's not the typical Immortatlis GPU we've seen consistently in recent history for SoCs.</p><h2 id="mediatek-s-next-flagship-2">MediaTek's next flagship</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dimensity 9500 pic.twitter.com/zOgxUdnLrH<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1934419737959882899">June 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>These rumored early specs for MediaTek's next flagship Dimensity are strange, especially considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">the Dimensity 9400's power</a>. The current generation's flagship features the same 1-3-4 core setup at 3.62GHz, 3.3GHz, and 2.4GHz, respectively. Moreover, it features a 12-core Immortalis-G925 GPU. We're still waiting to see more about this new graphics processor; the 9500 chip is supposedly rocking.</p><p>Though it's strange — the difference in power — the publication claims this is likely due to the early testing stage. More specifically, it says these lower clock speeds "clearly indicate it is not performing as per spec." In reality, it wouldn't make sense for MediaTek to release a "next-gen" flagship SoC that's weaker than last year's flagship. It would feel more like a mid-range chip in that case.</p><p>So, we'll most likely have to wait a little while longer before we see the true power of the Dimensity 9500, which the post claims will "trade blows" with Qualcomm's next Elite SoC.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that MediaTek launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus</a> SoC earlier this year. This model takes things up a notch over the original 9400 chip. For its single core, the chip clocks in at 3.73GHz, so it seems MediaTek is really trying to push toward the 4GHz mark.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Spotted first by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/16/google-play-slide-buy/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this “Slide to buy” feature is now live across the whole digital lineup, such as apps, books, movies, you name it.</p><p>This change appears to be rolling out wide with Play Store version 46.5.19-31.

Seeing this problem, Google has stepped in to fix it. What used to be a quick checkout had a downside—people clicking “buy” by mistake. This new slide move is Google's way of cutting down those oops moments for good.</p><p>With this change, now you have to swipe sideways to confirm before the usual password or fingerprint step kicks in. This new slide-to-buy gesture works the same whether you’re grabbing a one-off app or signing up for a subscription through the Play Store.</p><p>This swipe move is a solid upgrade, especially for people who’ve dialed back or turned off purchase checks. It’s a smart way to make buying stuff a whole lot less stressful, and honestly, we’re all here for it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After all, if you have a budget of around 500 bucks and you&apos;re not particular about brand names, why not just buy the newer Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartwatch-Wellness-Tracking-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YLBBMB"><strong>while it&apos;s on sale for $469 at Amazon?</strong></a></p><p>But, on the other hand, if you want the experience of using a powerful Garmin watch without spending around $1,000 on the latest and greatest model, the Epix Gen 2 is a great pick, and this deal might be exactly what you&apos;re looking for. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead, the tech giant is tapping the telephoto lens to boost close-up shots even more, according to a fresh leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-tele-macro-camera" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>.</p><p>This move makes sense when you consider how each lens focuses—telephoto needs more space, while ultrawide gets real close. So, with the Pixel 10, Google is making it smart enough to pick the right lens on the fly depending on how near your subject is.</p><p>At present, Pixel phones mostly rely on the ultrawide lens for macro shots, thanks to some smart engineering tweaks like autofocus that help nail those close-up details. And from the looks of it, that setup isn’t going anywhere with the Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="telephoto-s-macro-perks-2">Telephoto’s macro perks</h2><p>Compared to ultrawide lenses, telephoto lenses have some nifty perks for macro shots. They give you a nice, creamy background blur thanks to a shallower depth of field, which is ideal for making your subject pop. Plus, they avoid the funky distortions ultrawide shooters sometimes bring when you get up close.</p><p>It’s still up in the air whether this new telephoto-powered macro feature will be available across the whole Pixel 10 lineup. But with the official reveal just a couple months out, we won’t be waiting long to find out.</p><p>On top of beefed-up macro shots, the Pixel 10 is also said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-video-recording-upgrade">step up its video stabilization</a>. According to an earlier report, the phone's upgraded stabilization could rival a DJI Osmo Mobile 6 gimbal, meaning you might get buttery-smooth, pro-level footage straight from your phone, with no extra gear needed.</p><h2 id="triple-camera-shakeup-2">Triple-camera shakeup?</h2><p>Adding more fuel to the hype, early leaks hinted that the base Pixel 10 might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/camera-specs-of-the-pixel-10-series-leak-hinting-at-a-significant-downgrade">ditch the Pixel 9’s two-camera setup for a fresh triple-camera lineup</a>. Typically, regular versions stick to a wide and ultrawide lens, but the Pixel 10 looks set to shake things up by adding a telephoto lens as a third player.</p><p>To make room for it, Google is reportedly tweaking the sensor setup, which might mean some fresh changes to the wide and ultrawide cameras too.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To help businesses grow, the Meta-owned service is launching "Ads in Status." With this new feature, the post states its purpose is to "encourage" better/quicker communication between potential new customers and the business in question.</p><p>WhatsApp published a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://business.whatsapp.com/whatsapp-ads">business-focused page</a>, stating people who have created a Channel for their business can also utilize it.</p><p>The platform states the ads it provides were built with "privacy in mind." To display ads you might be interested in, WhatsApp states it does collect limited info like your country or city, language, the Channels you’re following, and how you interact with the ads you see." However, WhatsApp reiterates its commitment to keeping your texts, calls, and statuses private through end-to-end encryption (E2EE).</p><p>Joining "Ads in Status" is WhatsApp's new "Promoted Channels" feature. As previously stated, the app will use some limited data on you to determine what content you <em>might </em>be interested in seeing/interacting with. These promoted channels will appear when browsing your Update tab's "Channel" category.</p><h2 id="making-business-moves-2">Making Business Moves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.48%;"><img id="88FR5bVfFPc6qgtcKjHzWi" name="whats-app-update-tab-channel-subscriptions" alt="WhatsApp introduces Channel Subscriptions via the Updates tab, which let users conveniently see exclusive updates from places they've subscribed to." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88FR5bVfFPc6qgtcKjHzWi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="778" height="595" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure><p>WhatsApp is bringing one more feature to its Updates tab in June, called "Channel Subscriptions." Now, if there's a channel making content you enjoy, WhatsApp is letting you (and them) offer support for "exclusive updates" for a monthly fee. These fees will likely be left up to the admin of the channel that's offering exclusive content for its subscribers.</p><p>These three updates were announced today (June 16), so they should've started rolling out already. However, it might take a little while, so just ensure WhatsApp is updated on your phone or tablet as the week continues.</p><p>Rolling out business-focused content updates isn't anything new for WhatsApp, as the platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-updates-app-e-commerce-features">brought in-app shopping capabilities</a> a while ago. This was an update in 2023 that let users purchase items from merchants in WhatsApp through its business platform. The service made its payment functions easier and also implemented a verification process to bring users some comfort. Elsewhere, in the past few months, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-generative-ai-business-tools-launch">Meta discussed new business tools</a> that use generative AI.</p><p>Essentially, business owners and advertisers could utilize generative AI to create images and text. A test for this started on Facebook and Instagram late last year, with WhatsApp in its sights.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The names could correlate, at least in part, to the models' respective sizes.</p><p>Galagos, for instance, are known for their small size. That's the alleged reference for the smallest Pixel 12 member, the base model.

Since then, we've seen references to cats, dogs, and reptiles. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">Google Pixel 10 series is said to be codenamed after horses</a>, and the next Pixel 11 generation is rumored to be codenamed after bears. Now, Mystic Leaks believes the further-out Pixel 12 lineup will be named after primates.</p><p>Of course, these codenames are strictly for internal development use. But like old-fashioned Android codenames, they serve as fun ways to track the progress of future Google Pixel hardware. For now, these references don't reveal much about the company's plan for its 2027 lineup of flagship Android smartphones.</p><p>It does seem to indicate that Google plans to keep the Pixel lineup roughly as-is in terms of offerings and sizes. If the company wanted to add a different-sized base model flagship, we might've seen five leaked codenames instead of four. The same could be true if Google planned to introduce a flip-style foldable to pair with the Google Pixel Fold series.</p><p>However, it's always possible that Google has tricks up its sleeve, so we can't rule anything out based on rumored codenames alone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The aim is to help people sleep better. If their sleep is inconsistent for more than a few days, Bedtime Guidance analyzes the same and helps users get significant rest.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="brT4uihzszeAu99JDP24yQ" name="One-UI-8-Vascular-Load" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/brT4uihzszeAu99JDP24yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Vascular Load feature, on the other hand, wants to ensure users receive insights into their vascular load and the cardiovascular stress during their sleep.

It includes optimized intensity and injury prevention routines, which should be ideal for beginners as well.</p><p>Plus, it also offers motivation, real-time guidance, and a personalized training program, per user's fitness level. Moreover, Galaxy Watch users, while wearing the smartwatch and running for 12 minutes, can immediately receive a performance analysis and a running level score. Then, a comprehensive training plan is believed to be generated further, helping users to support their preferred marathon runs.</p><h2 id="antioxidant-index-2">Antioxidant Index</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="pQgUuXfKVZy8QFhLoU24yQ" name="One-UI-8-Antioxidant-Index" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQgUuXfKVZy8QFhLoU24yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the Antioxidant Index feature on Galaxy Watch will be able to measure carotenoids — "antioxidants found in green and orange fruits and vegetables — that are stored in the skin." It is said to be utilizing an industry-first feature to assess carotenoid levels in about five seconds, backed by an advanced, light-activated BioActive sensor.</p><p>All these insights supposedly reflect behavioral changes. The aim of the feature is to tackle radicals in the body caused by behavioral factors like alcohol consumption, smoking, for example. Antioxidants, on the other hand, will neutralize those free radicals in order to prevent chronic illness. Thus, the feature with the ability to measure carotenoid antioxidants helps Galaxy Watch users adopt healthier habits.</p><h2 id="galaxy-watch-5-series-and-above-2">Galaxy Watch 5 series and above</h2><p>These advanced features are available for Galaxy Watch users who are willing to try out the One UI 8 Watch beta. However, some features like Vascular Load are available only on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 models.

Meta teased the new partnership on social media, creating a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/oakleymeta/">Instagram Oakley Meta account</a>, teasing that "the next evolution is coming on June 20."</p><p>We first heard about a potential Oakley Meta partnership <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">back in January</a>. Leaks suggested a new pair of smart glasses was in development, dubbed "Supernova 2," a direct follow-up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, which feature the code name "Supernova."</p><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses feature a camera on the left side of the frame, while Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are rumored to feature a camera in the center.</p><p>Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are also rumored to use Oakley Sphaera frames. I created a mock-up above using Sphaera frames and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-eye">Xreal Eye camera</a> centered just under the nose bridge, similar to how Xreal positions it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> series smart glasses.</p><p>While we don't have official imagery of these new Oakley glasses just yet, this should give you an idea of how they might look.</p><h2 id="sportier-than-ray-bans-2">Sportier than Ray-Bans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD" name="Engo-2-AR-glasses-close-up" alt="ENGO 2 AR glasses sitting on a deck at a front-left-facing angle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pictured above are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ar-running-glasses-arent-ready-yet-but-future-is-almost-here">ENGO 2 HUD</a> smart glasses, which look similar to many Oakley styles. ENGO 2 HUD features a small screen to help athletes keep track of stats without having to look down at a watch, but we don't expect Meta to pack a display into Oakley Meta Smart Glasses. Instead, it's far more likely that these Oakley frames will be designed for streaming and recording footage as their main function.</p><p>If Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are anything like the Ray-Ban Metas, they'll feature the battery and other electronics in the arms rather than on the nose bridge as ENGO did. While it's possible that Meta could outfit its new Oakley-branded smart glasses with fitness-focused extras like a heart rate monitor, we haven't seen credible rumors yet suggesting that as a possibility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We do expect Oakley Meta Smart Glasses to be a better fit for athletes than Ray-Ban Metas, though. Android Central's Michael Hicks recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">ran a marathon with Ray-Ban Metas</a> and found that, while the functionality was excellent, the fit wasn't quite right for running. Oakley Meta Smart Glasses should fix this with a design that's better suited for athletic activities, including running, cycling, and other sports.</p><p>We fully expect Meta to introduce a third generation of Ray-Ban Meta glasses later this year, as well, which are said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">to include a display</a> in one of the lenses. But we probably won't see these until Meta Connect 2025 in mid-September.</p><p>For now, Oakley Meta Smart Glasses will be the first big commercial smart glasses announcement from Meta in 2025. Given that Ray-Ban Metas sold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">2 million units and counting</a>, we're curious how Oakley Meta glasses will match up for popularity.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The rumors of the device have been swirling around for the past two years. While we have seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">renders</a> of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE earlier, it is interesting to see the device finally seeing the light of day, according to these recent certifications.</p><p>The expected specifications of the Galaxy Z Flip FE include a 6.7-inch foldable 120Hz screen coupled with a 3.4-inch cover screen. Underneath, the foldable device is expected to ship with an Exynos 2400e chipset paired with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. For optics, it could have a 50MP primary lens and a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, and a 10MP shooter for selfies. It is likely to have One UI 8 (Android 16) on board and feature a 4000mAh battery.</p><p>Alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, Samsung will also introduce the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, and the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8"> Galaxy Watch 8</a> series at the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event, most likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york">happening in early July</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

What I like is that it has a foldable design with blade plugs that retract into the body, and that just makes it that much more convenient.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="v9rRrwLttgERGRTE6imnob" name="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W" alt="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v9rRrwLttgERGRTE6imnob.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming in at just 80g and 13mm thickness, it's light enough to take just about anywhere, and the ultra-thin design is a huge advantage. Most GaN chargers tend to be squarish, but the flatter profile clearly makes a difference in this regard. And like the best chargers, the UltraSlim utilizes GaN tech to good effect, delivering reliable USB PD charging in a diminutive size.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hrtVu8zyLGNrNgkAQHiEqb" name="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W" alt="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrtVu8zyLGNrNgkAQHiEqb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Build quality is great, and I didn't see any issues in the month I used the charger.

Each port hits 45W over the USB PD 3.0 standard, and you get the usual charging profiles: 5V/3A, 9V/3A, 12V/3A, and 15V/3A. It does a good job with Samsung devices as well thanks to PPS, and because you get two ports, there's a total 70W power budget (35W max with each port) when both are in use. If you're using it with a phone and any accessory, it switches to 45W + 20W.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZL2dNYYtMKJkeDAxxHZinb" name="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W" alt="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZL2dNYYtMKJkeDAxxHZinb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you don't need more than two USB-C charging ports, the UltraSlim is a great travel charger; it's much smaller than its mainstream rivals, and 45W charging out of each port is ideal if you're using Pixel or Galaxy devices.

Right off the bat, you’ll see a big preview of your watch and its current face. Just below that, key information like battery level, last sync time, and connection status is front and center.

It appears the company is having yet another product up its sleeve dubbed the OnePlus Pad Lite.</p><p>The renders of a new upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> from the company have surfaced, which were shared by Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka OnLeaks) together with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-pad-lite-design-specifications-leaked-exclusive/">91mobiles</a>. The OnePlus Pad Lite is tailored for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">budget Android tablet</a> segment and touted to be the successor to the company's first budget tablet, the OnePlus Pad Go, launched in 2023.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good Morning #FutureSquad!

It includes a single rear camera at the back, and the front should have a 11-inch LCD display. It is expected to come in 1920 x 1080 resolution with a 90Hz refresh.</p><p>Underneath, the Pad Lite is likely to include a MediaTek Helio G100 chipset with 2.2GHz clock speeds paired with up to 6GB RAM and 128GB onboard storage — with more options available during the launch. The tablet is also touted with a 9340mAh battery capacity — a significant improvement over the predecessor, which had 8000mAh.</p><p>The tablet is believed to be coming with a 5MP rear camera next to a 5MP front-facing camera. However, the predecessor had offered 8MP cameras each. The expected dimensions comprise 254.9 x 166.5 x 7.4mm and weigh around 539 grams. Overall, the device should feel a bit taller, wider, and thinner than the previous iteration.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="pEn3bEfRsiNFTE9oW4EdSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pEn3bEfRsiNFTE9oW4EdSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:819px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.26%;"><img id="wqs4sJ2dTwyNbKdHCPkZSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak-01" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wqs4sJ2dTwyNbKdHCPkZSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="819" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:85.71%;"><img id="9Tdp6HQ7dF4mV9PT9Z4fSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak-02" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Tdp6HQ7dF4mV9PT9Z4fSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="700" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="launch-still-unclear-2">Launch still unclear</h2><p>The OnePlus Pad Lite could be carrying an Aero Blue colorway with a folio cover accessory also complementary to the tablet's cover.

Instead, I found out the hard way what happens when you ignore Garmin's algorithm.</p><p>I spent May in a bit of a running slump, my mileage dipping about 40 miles from my monthly average. So I decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-need-a-fitness-reboot-this-summer-your-smartwatch-has-the-tools-you-need">rebound in June</a> with more steps and miles. I kicked things off with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">half marathon while wearing Ray-Ban Metas</a> on June 1, and then I decided that I could do another hard, hilly run on Global Running Day with a local running group.</p><p>By the end of my 7-mile run, I'd fallen behind the group and felt physically weak with a tight right hamstring. I checked my watch later and found I was right above my body's running tolerance.</p><p>But since I desperately wanted to rejuvenate my fitness efforts, I went out for a low-aerobic jog a couple of days later once my training readiness score had climbed up a bit. It was a mistake: Even if my heart and lungs felt fine, my hamstring all but gave out on me. I ended up limping home. A week of recovery and a busy travel week at an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-of-awe-2025-coolest-xr-demos-niantic-viture-sony-android-xr">XR convention</a> later, I'm back where I started.</p><p>The experience taught me two things: Garmin's running tolerance estimate is legitimate, and I truly hope it doesn't remain restricted to Garmin's $750 running watch like other "premium" tools.</p><h2 id="how-garmin-running-tolerance-works-2">How Garmin Running Tolerance works</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2133px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="uZaqu5Qyk9ptcvAwY3yBsC" name="Garmin-acute-impact-load-miles-widget-graphic" alt="Render of the Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the user's Acute Impact Load miles (48.1), Tolerance (52 miles/week), and Actual 7d miles (43.3)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uZaqu5Qyk9ptcvAwY3yBsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2133" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin says Running Tolerance helps you "recognize potentially hazardous training patterns" and "intelligently manage the impact of running on your body as you work to build and maintain mileage."</p><p>It builds off of acute load, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> effect on your body from the past seven days of workouts, which most Garmin Forerunner models track. But this metric focuses on excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), rather than the<em> </em><strong>biomechanical</strong> load.</p><p>That's where Running Tolerance changes things. For each run, it takes into account your weight, speed, intensity, ground contact time, cadence, and significant uphills and downhills, among other concerns.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ozDBXcjHcBz96FYZkRaZW7" name="Garmin-acute-impact-load-miles-track-workout" alt="A post-run "Impact Load" widget showing the actual mileage (2 mi) and impact load (3.8 mi) of a track workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozDBXcjHcBz96FYZkRaZW7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A hard track workout put nearly twice the strain on my body as a normal 2-mile run </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The goal is to track the "force exerted by the ground on your body." And a speedy downhill run, for example, might be "three times harder than an easy run on level ground." And you might not normally realize it, because the run felt easy on your lungs.</p><p>Garmin then judges your acute impact load miles against your running tolerance, based on your recent running history. It warns you if you've entered a "cautionary state" where you should be careful of injury or burnout.</p><p>It's separate from Garmin's typical post-run recovery estimate because it takes more than your cardiovascular system into account. And that's vital context for runners!</p><p>Of course, most semi-serious runners will show better impulse control than I did and stop themselves when their bodies tell them to. But running tolerance is still critical for anyone trying to take their training to the next level.</p><h2 id="beginner-runners-need-this-more-than-veterans-2">Beginner runners need this more than veterans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ohdBtUHeHoZxinE6FMpMPk" name="Garmin-acute-impact-load-weekly-limit-widget" alt="The Garmin Acute Impact Load miles widget on the Garmin Forerunner 970, showing the runner's weekly impact load miles against their weekly tolerance and actual weekly mileage." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohdBtUHeHoZxinE6FMpMPk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Knowing your body's upper limit is the kind of context all runners need, from pros to couch-to-5Kers. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin's whole wearable strategy is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/forerunner-570-and-970-have-made-garmin-tiered-strategy-clearer-than-ever">price-locking software</a>, such as how the Forerunner 970 gets offline maps but the 570 doesn't, or how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a> uses training load data in the background to create daily suggested workouts but blocks you from seeing the widget. It makes you pay extra for the best tools.</p><p>And fine, if Garmin wants to lock maps, real-time stamina, Strava Live Segments, and endurance scores to the premium models like the 970 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, we just have to accept that.</p><p>But running tolerance is <em>designed</em> to prevent injuries by warning people off who don't know their limits. And I'd argue that it's more important for couch-to-5K runners or casual runners to see that their body isn't ready for a half marathon, or that they've hit their weekly limit and need to ease off to avoid injury.</p><p>Are casual runners going to spend $750 on a running watch? No, and they shouldn't! Not until they're advanced enough to take full advantage of the features. But the weekly running tolerance limit doesn't feel "advanced" to me; it feels fundamental.</p><p>I shouldn't have ignored my running tolerance data, but at least I was forewarned. Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners don't get that context.

At their booth, I wore a lightweight surgical HMD and a night-vision AR helmet for soldiers' targeting and guidance. I also checked out their ultra-bright microLED display, the in-vogue tech for AR glasses and smartwatches.</p><p>But Kopin's most promising tech for consumers is its NeuralDisplay. It uses "traditional RGB pixels, image-sensing pixels, and advanced signal processing algorithms" to track your eye movement and neurological response in a functional VR display.</p><p>I saw the tech in action at AWE (and you can see a video example below). The Kopin engineer shone a flashlight into his eye, and the display immediately detected his pupil dilation and adjusted the brightness and contrast to prevent any discomfort.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ipqm5IJNVSE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The version they showed off at AWE, built on OLED but compatible with microLED, can adjust the display's content automatically to match the user's gaze and simulate depth.</p><p>It can track data like the user's blinking rate to judge if the person is fatigued or enable foveated rendering, all without needing any SoC processing power. And in the case of military applications (or FPS games), this tech could determine that the user isn't looking in the direction of a threat and guide their gaze that way.</p><p>It's still an in-progress prototype that needs silicon improvements to enable better color accuracy and sensitivity. But CEO Michael Murray said that they proved wrong the naysayers who "said we couldn't pull it off," and that companies like Meta, Apple, and Anduril will be very interested in licensing their patent so that they can shed the weight of their eye-tracking cameras.

Dot occasionally refused to answer my questions, blathering on about whatever it <em>thought</em> I was next to. The Snap Spectacles battery reached critical lows after about 15 minutes of Q&A, with the display struggling with the sunny weather; it's hard to say when AR glasses hardware will be ready for a city tour.

If I hadn't already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">demoed Moohan last month</a>, the insane 3552×3840 resolution would have blown my mind. But being able to get up close to a virtual book page and read every word without straining, or examine the details of a painting, is still beyond what any current VR headset can offer.</p><p>Sony also showed off subtle finger controllers that you can squeeze to select and move spatial content. Hand tracking works pretty well on most recent headsets like the Quest and Vision Pro, but having a wearable controller adds more precision so you're not vainly struggling with missed camera inputs while trying to work.</p><p>Almost no one will end up using Sony's premium XYN headset; it's designed for "spatial content creation," meaning only enterprise users willing to drop nearly five grand to create CADs will need one. But it's still a promising sign of how immersive XR headsets are getting, and I love the flip-up display design for productivity.</p><h2 id="android-xr-smart-ring-controls-2">Android XR smart ring controls</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dgZs7Q8ensYqq49TLTPjgd" name="Android-XR-smart-ring-controls-awe-2025" alt="The author wearing a Kiwear smart ring capable of gesture controls, using it to slice fruit in Fruit Ninja on a tablet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgZs7Q8ensYqq49TLTPjgd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the Qualcomm show booth, they had a space for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250610859777/en/KiWear-Unveils-Smart-Ring-Input-Solution-for-AI-Glasses-in-Collaboration-with-Qualcomm-at-AWE-USA-2025">KiWear</a>, a smart ring reference design for gesture controls for AR, XR, and smart glasses.

The IMU could differentiate between pinches away from or towards you for different functions, and the built-in PPG could display health data on the glasses.</p><p>You can also reach the ring out to tap virtual objects or use the ring touchpad to select or scroll.

For example, color passthrough on the Quest 3 can be useful when you want to retain some awareness of your surroundings while you're flailing about playing Beat Saber. However, it does have its limitations.</p><p>If you're like me, you likely have your phone with you at all times and check it frequently. The problem with VR is that even with passthrough, it's not always easy to see what's on your screen. And if you're really like me, then you're probably blind as a bat but too stubborn to use your glasses with your VR headset, making the passthrough view even more challenging to use when trying to read text on your phone display.</p><p>Fortunately, Motorola has a solution for Quest 3 and Quest 3S owners that lets you use your phone on your VR headset. It can come in pretty handy, although it's not without its quirks, and not everyone will have access to it.</p><h2 id="what-is-smart-connect-2">What is Smart Connect?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C5odHXQPDjZAMAfcMTmFx5" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-Smart-Connect-VR-headset" alt="VR Headset option in Motorola Smart Connect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5odHXQPDjZAMAfcMTmFx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect app</a> on the Meta Quest 3 earlier this year as an easy way to stream and control your phone from within your headset.

Of course, it goes without saying that you'll need a Motorola phone for this to work.</p><p>First, you have to download the Smart Connect app from the Horizon Store. Once that's done, follow the prompts to start the process of syncing your devices together, which will require scanning a QR code on your phone.</p><p>Open the Smart Connect app on your phone and tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the top corner. Select <strong>VR headset</strong>, then <strong>Continue pairing</strong>, and you should see a QR code appear, assuming you've already begun the process on your Quest. Place the QR code within the Quest 3 viewfinder, and your devices will pair, and you'll be ready to use your phone from your headset.</p><h2 id="using-my-phone-on-my-quest-2">Using my phone on my Quest</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3222px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CykKmQGW7V3eT5qn3geXDQ" name="3274983b81f6c8e2260edb1fb31b4aae" alt="App streaming and mobile desktop on Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CykKmQGW7V3eT5qn3geXDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3222" height="1812" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>App streaming is the first thing I tried, as it's the most straightforward way to use Smart Connect. You can select from just about any app on your phone to stream to the headset, and it'll open in a phone-like view. You can also use your phone to open any app on your VR headset by swiping up and sending it to Smart Connect.</p><p>What's great about this is that you can regularly scroll, view videos, and even send messages straight from your headset. You can also have up to three open and active apps in one window and easily move between them. You can also resize some apps by rotating or using the resize button up top, which can open certain apps like Gmail in a tablet-like view. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and not every app will scale properly.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3363px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="NN8FT4mAUSQ8tYz9vAuSCQ" name="11964c1dcda851b9432c811baba04858" alt="Streaming multiple apps via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NN8FT4mAUSQ8tYz9vAuSCQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3363" height="1891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3020px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="J7pybhoqqFGohF9DoDRUAQ" name="f8e0ca67dfb25cce9b33915afebfc6e9" alt="Gmail via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J7pybhoqqFGohF9DoDRUAQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3020" height="1698" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3054px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HXAVrLntqcoM848oHGoqBQ" name="dfbb86b9b5ee5875ff54447f6b66f6cb" alt="Gmail via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXAVrLntqcoM848oHGoqBQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3054" height="1718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For some apps, such as Instagram, you may be better off using the native Quest app, as it's more optimized for the VR display than the Smart Connect version.

tap away from your notifications and quick settings, as well as other settings and options scattered throughout the desktop home screen.</p><p>Surprisingly, whether you're using app streaming or the desktop mode, the app experience is relatively smooth. It's not perfect by any means, and the results may depend on your Wi-Fi connection; however, it's a fairly solid implementation for anyone looking to use their phone with their Quest 3.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-all-roses-2">It's not all roses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3079px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wTLGYzh8nkjnnS7UaGkf9Q" name="Meta-Quest-3-passthrough-Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 as see on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wTLGYzh8nkjnnS7UaGkf9Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3079" height="1732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Looking at my Razr Ultrs 2025 via the Quest 3 passthrough view. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I mentioned before, there are some quirks with how apps behave on Smart Connect for the Quest. For instance, with app streaming, while most apps you use are likely displayed vertically, horizontal apps (usually games) may have trouble and sometimes won't open at all. I find it helps to tap the expand button above the app to help things along, and usually it should work. However, this issue also extends to YouTube, for example, which doesn't scale properly in horizontal orientation unless you're in full-screen mode.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="JLeiYoxgpimo3nM65VwkAQ" name="0d1de276a5fa28a0adcf102ebdf0d838" alt="YouTube via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JLeiYoxgpimo3nM65VwkAQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2938" height="1653" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rAFAF8gUukQNY62tj5Mq8Q" name="accb70fead6d9e91cf4be2fa14531f8c" alt="A full-screen YouTube video via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAFAF8gUukQNY62tj5Mq8Q.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3021" height="1699" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The keyboard experience is also pretty wonky and oftentimes confusing. It's a much more limited experience than the normal Quest keyboard, so you don't have options like swiping to type or word suggestions. That means, when you make a mistake, there's no easy way to correct it without going back or deleting.</p><p>The problem is, the keyboard view and what's on the app don't always sync up correctly. If I move the cursor back to correct a word on the keyboard view, the cursor in the app will stay in place and start deleting or adding words at the end of my sentence. So it'll look correct on the keyboard but not on the app. I can always move the cursor in the app to correct the word, but then it won't do the same on the keyboard view.</p><p>The only way I found I could get around the typing experience is to just use the Gboard's voice typing, which comes in clutch. However, this is only accessible in the app view, not on the Quest keyboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QViTVbTcpcv5GFyKzTdYwP" name="e6197be6ba13efe52bff9824a81dfd73" alt="Google Messages and Gboard voice typing via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QViTVbTcpcv5GFyKzTdYwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1801" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But perhaps my biggest problem is scaling. Whether you're using app streaming or desktop mode, the buttons are quite small, and you won't want to use hand-tracking to navigate through your apps.</p><p>In desktop mode, this issue can be somewhat mitigated by adjusting the resolution before entering the mode, and then going in and adjusting the desktop mode display options (which are handily located in the taskbar), but it's still challenging to see some of the smaller elements, especially those tucked within the taskbar. To exit a full-screen app in this mode, swipe down from the top of the window until a bar appears, then click the <strong>X</strong> button.</p><p>It's not the most intuitive experience, and unfortunately, many of these issues have been carried over from the desktop version of Smart Connect.</p><h2 id="a-decent-start-2">A decent start</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sK7qxGYPAJaYrqr6dDFRBQ" name="12939c99808dacb222108051a33516b3" alt="Smart Connect app streaming while Beat Saber is paused on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sK7qxGYPAJaYrqr6dDFRBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3650" height="2053" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate having to fully interrupt my VR immersion by removing the headset to check my phone. That's why Smart Connect feels like a godsend for me, as I can just check my apps from within the headset and quickly resume whatever game I'm playing.</p><p>Now, Motorola should try to optimize the UI a bit to work better on VR headsets. Buttons need to be bigger, the keyboard experience needs some improvements, notifications should be more prevalent in <em>both</em> modes, and I would love to see more functions from the desktop version of Smart Connect, such as phone mirroring.</p><p>Still, this is a good start, and if you're the owner of a Quest 3 and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>, you should give Smart Connect a try.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A bad water leak inside my home means I have to replace some of my electrical wiring and almost all of my cable internet equipment as well as the water heater. Since I'm using a well, there was no usage spike on the meter to warn me I had a problem so it's hard to tell how long this has gone on, but it made one hell of a mess. What a way to start a week.</p><p>I spent the time installing one coaxial cable to a dry spot so I could reconnect my internet service. I work from home and it's vital I have it because working at McDonald's is ... well ... terrible. I appreciate them allowing me to come in and spend the afternoon and they even gave me a free coffee. You'll find some good people in the country; what you won't find is adequate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/2021-needs-focus-rural-5g-help-save-my-terrible-broadband-experience">high-speed internet</a>.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div><p>I have the "choice" of one internet provider. Ignore what you hear about competition laws and rules because they have never mattered here. My internet provider needs to replace some of their equipment (just a glorified coaxial connector) attached to my home. They will be able to do it on Wednesday. Until then, I'm left on my own. It's not the provider's fault that water damaged everything. I also understand they can't send a technician out into the woods to service one person if they're busy. My understanding doesn't help my situation.</p><p>Where all this becomes a problem is cellular coverage. Remember all the promises of nationwide wireless broadband and how it was coming thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/mobile-broadband-5g-still-needs-fixing">miracle of 5G</a>? It was a lie. I do have cell service at my house but it's not nearly fast enough to be useful for anyone who works from home. As for the "choice" of wireless providers? Mine is T-Mobile or one of several MVNOs that use T-Mobile's infrastructure. I even drove into town and grabbed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-home-internet-review">Home Internet kit</a> because someone thought it might be fast enough, but it's not.</p><p>I choose to live here because I like it here. But it's high time everyone realizes that rural communities have been told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-and-other-carriers-still-havent-covered-rural-areas-regardless-what-they-say">promise after promise</a> of how they would be brought into the 21st century with adequate information access and it never happens. Forget all the commercials and testimonials companies like to show you because all you <em>really</em> need to do is ask someone who lives it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR" name="cell-tower.jpg" alt="5g cell tower" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The worst thing is that there is no real solution to the problem outside of government-controlled broadband access. There aren't enough people here to justify new equipment or more cellular installations and corporations aren't going to lose money so I have better internet and more choice. I get that.</p><p>If you don't live in the U.S. or Canada you might not understand the situation: most of the people live in a small area in and around metropolitan areas. That means there are vast areas of space without enough people for companies to worry about. My provider (I'm not naming them because it's not their fault in the end) really doesn't care if it loses me or one of the few hundred others who live in my small community. They care about the apartments and city blocks filled with people who will happily pay their monthly fees to have service. That's who they <em>should</em> care about because they have no incentive to care otherwise. This is a problem that probably will never be fixed.</p><p>I'm not a Capitalist, Communist, Democrat, or a Republican. I care about what's best for my family. I don't want to see more government involvement when it comes to basic utilities and I have a good idea of what a federal broadband provider would end up turning into. There is room for government oversight in many areas — including broadband access — but restricted, censored, state-sponsored internet isn't the answer. There really is no answer other than me paying someone to cut down a bunch of trees and put <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/starlink-home-internet-review">a satellite dish on my roof</a>. I checked into that, too. End of July if I want it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SABvG9UwRnHW2a7UDSg49B" name="Starlink-lifestyle-lifestyle-16x9-01-08.jpg" alt="Starlink dishy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SABvG9UwRnHW2a7UDSg49B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's starting to feel like I need to make a choice. I can stay here where the air is clean, the neighbors are friendly enough to leave each other alone, and the fishing is to die for. Or I can pack up and leave, heading somewhere where my technology-focused career is better nurtured. I wish I could say to hell with it all and go back to wiring houses like I did when I was 20. Life was a lot easier and the money was good enough to pay my way through school. That can't happen because construction sites are notoriously wheelchair-unfriendly. I'm not sure what to do at this point; spending the day sitting in my chair at a sticky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/mcdonalds-google-cloud-ask-pickles-partnership">McDonald's table</a> isn't my first choice though.</p><p>You <strong>can't</strong> do anything to help even if you want to help. I don't mean me and my situation, which will work itself out by the end of next week. But about the problem as a whole. But you do need to be aware of it and be a little skeptical the next time some agency or a company tells you how they're serving millions more people across rural America. The real problems are where there aren't millions of people in the first place, but there are enough people that need someone to give a damn.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After multiple Beta releases and practically giving us a hint at almost all the features of the new OS, Google launched the stable version of the software this week.</p><p>Android 16 brings with it one of the most awaited features <strong>— </strong>live updates or real-time notifications, allowing users to track everything from food delivery to ride-sharing, all from the lockscreen or the notification drop-down.</p><p>People using hearing aids, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">LE Audio,</a> also get a little something with this OS update. With Android 16, users will have the ability to switch to using their phone's microphone for clearer calls in noisy environments.</p><p>Android 16 is bringing additional tools for users to protect themselves from unwanted scam apps, calls, or other online threats.

Google says it's making multitasking seamless on foldables and tablets, bringing a feature called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16s-desktop-mode-was-right-in-front-of-us-the-entire-time">Desktop Windowing</a>," which was teased at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">Google I/O 2025</a>.

In its latest blog post, Samsung previewed a new intelligent camera system that can be more intuitive and understand what users are shooting and adjust itself to match any situation.</p><p>“As AI evolves from text-based prompts to multimodal understanding, Galaxy devices are becoming smarter — able to get what you’re looking at and respond to situations. The camera is at the heart of this transformation,” the company explained.</p><p>“More than just a tool for capturing images, coupled with enhanced AI-powered features, the Galaxy camera is now part of the intuitive interface that turns what users see into understanding and action.”</p><p>The company also adds that these cameras will easily adapt to the users' needs and make capturing moments more personal and seamless, with the power of AI.</p><hr><h2 id="galaxy-watch-8-shows-renders-show-up-online-2">Galaxy Watch 8 shows renders show up online</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Y2JgXdyhUcT9xxTp3ydHaW" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-base-model-render-leak" alt="A leaked rendering of the base Galaxy Watch 8 suggests it will receive a simpler, cleaner squircle design with two physical buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2JgXdyhUcT9xxTp3ydHaW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-clean-simple-squircle-ultra-redesign-leak"><strong>here </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leaked-on-ebay"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 leaks keep getting better.  This week, leaked renders of the alleged watch showed up online, giving us a good idea of what the actual device might look like.</p><p>The renders suggested that the Galaxy Watch 8 would show up with a squircle design, as seen in previous leaks as well. The renders of the device show the wearable in a sleeker design, with white straps, a square-ish silver base, and its circular watch face on top. The Watch 8 is speculated to have only two physical buttons and come in two sizes.</p><p>Additionally, someone ended up uploading pictures of the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on eBay. In the listing, the smartwatch is seen with a leather strap, a circular (more squircle) design, with a prominent crown sitting between two buttons. The speakers are also seen on one side of the smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is expected to show up with a steel or titanium finish.</p><hr><h2 id="the-week-of-outages-2">The week of outages</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD" name="Google-services.jpg" alt="Google apps in a single folder on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/theres-a-massive-chatgpt-outage-maybe-its-time-to-switch-over-to-gemini"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-spotify-amazon-and-more-hit-by-a-widespread-outage-impacting-thousands"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>This week saw outages on several online platforms, beginning with ChatGPT on June 10, where users experienced a massive 12-hour outage.

They give you a lot for $129. Let’s talk about the hardware first! I’ll address the app in a bit.</p><p>The Liberty 5 are the successor to the Liberty 4 NC, but they do contain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/soundcore-liberty-4-pro-review" target="_blank">elements of the Liberty 4 Pro</a>. Aesthetically, the first thing you’ll notice is that the case looks and slides like the Liberty 4 Pro, minus the in-case display and touch bar. Slide the lid up, and you get a pairing button inside.</p><p>Below that, on the lip of the bottom half, you’ll find a light bar that indicates battery and connection status but is difficult to see outdoors, even in overcast sunlight. The case charges via USB-C and Qi wireless connections and has a matte finish that resists fingerprints very well, in contrast to the fingerprint magnet that is the Liberty 4 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="BC9LnV2ZURSAzBWY9vhxNJ" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-buds.JPG" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 earbuds. out of their case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BC9LnV2ZURSAzBWY9vhxNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pop the earbuds out of the case, and you’ll find the same stem-style buds found in the previous generation, along with the clicky stem-based controls. In my couple of weeks with the earbuds, those controls took a bit of getting used to, but once I did, they were reliable and didn’t give me any false triggering issues when adjusting or readjusting them during exercise.</p><p>With the Liberty 5 earbuds, you’ll have five additional ear tips to choose from (shown in the gallery above). I used the default ear tips (mediums), which worked fine. Adjusting the seal of the right ear with the small gave me a better fit, so I stuck with that configuration for the remainder of my review period.</p><p>I appreciate that the white ear tips have a barely visible marking on them, indicating the size, so if you want to switch, you immediately know what you had in and which option you may want to try next.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:827px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.43%;"><img id="nEnSUCJGxiVsxT3Rs2g5MK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-device-setup" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Google setup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nEnSUCJGxiVsxT3Rs2g5MK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="827" height="1856" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="Fxqaixe2f2r7sWrvXRKAKK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-home" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Soundcore app home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fxqaixe2f2r7sWrvXRKAKK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="BMGS7TfwWFdhBJaFn2iyKK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-settings" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Soundcore app, more settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BMGS7TfwWFdhBJaFn2iyKK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-cancellation-levels" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="V2chFyqZGXuRRxRJJ8Wsv6" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-ldac" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app Sound Mode settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2chFyqZGXuRRxRJJ8Wsv6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The app is highly customizable, featuring an 8-band EQ and 22 preset options, as well as the ability to create custom presets tailored to your hearing preferences.</p><p>There’s a gaming mode, the ability to switch between AAC and LDAC playback, and the option to adjust the strength of the ANC.

The 4 Pro presented a relatively balanced stereo image out of the box. The Liberty 5, on the other hand, are bass-heavy throughout most of the default sound profiles offered. If you’re a bass lover, this may not be bad, but it isn’t optimal and doesn’t present the full sonic image that the Liberty 5 can produce.</p><p>Overall, I’d characterize the default sound as having a very warm bottom in the upper bass with a lighter sub-bass punch. Mids are scooped, and highs are bright but compete with the amped lows.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="PifebBBT2Xbzn6R3UVtRAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-preference" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings Preference Test" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PifebBBT2Xbzn6R3UVtRAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="DQNB6DjCdw4yYngUxkGADe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-hearID" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings HearID" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DQNB6DjCdw4yYngUxkGADe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="GtQzm529zYrvz6jN8fQCAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-EQ-8band" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings 8-band EQ" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GtQzm529zYrvz6jN8fQCAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-cancellation-levels" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings ANC levels customization" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Once you’ve connected your Liberty 5 and you dive into the app, you’ll find two different sound options that allow you to better tailor the output: Preference Test and HearID Sound Test. Preference tailors sound based on perception, while HearID tailors sound based on your level of hearing loss, if any.</p><p>I prefer HearID over the Preference Test because it compensates for hearing loss across the audible frequency spectrum, so your EQ will be “true.” Once I updated my HearID test, something I hadn’t done in 12 months, and made a couple of small tweaks to the Preference Test settings, the sound quality was much more balanced and nuanced.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CSLnxtUF3PHSvsNH9EQRKG" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-in-ear-alt" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 shown being worn by the reviewer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSLnxtUF3PHSvsNH9EQRKG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With my sonic profile preferences sorted, I hit my DSF files and played one of my “go-tos” for testing nuance: Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Startin’ Something.” The intro has backing vocals that get lost with less capably tuned earbuds and headphones, but the Liberty 5 reproduced those vocals and the nuance in that track with aplomb.</p><p>The same can be said for the high-bitrate PCM Marvin Gaye files I listened to. Looking at the Developer Options menu on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, confirming that I was streaming “Trouble Man” and “Ain’t Nothing Like The Real Thing,” using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained" target="_blank">LDAC at 32bits/96kHz</a>, the experience was very satisfying.</p><p>Gaye’s arrangements are orchestral and expertly mastered, imparting a beautiful sense of space and nuanced instrumentation that is robust in its basslines and highs. His vocals and falsetto are top-tier, so much of that can get lost with a lesser pair of earbuds. Not the case with these. His vocals are bright and full of texture, as are Tammi Terrell’s, and the combination of their voices on that duet, presented through these earbuds, is immersive and highly entertaining.</p><p>Every other genre I threw at the Liberty 5 was well represented. The Liberty 5 proves to be a capable pair of relatively inexpensive Bluetooth earbuds that are sonically proficient with everything from speed metal to hip-hop to film scores and soundtracks.</p><p>Mic quality is clear, but on some calls, it sounded like I was in a closet. In one of my Discord chats, I left a nearly three-minute voice message for the group and listened to it back. It was crystal clear, with no closet sound, and it adeptly cancelled background noise.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="BgD5aec5twkeZbDNTN8FrH" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-usb-c.JPG" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 case, showing the USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BgD5aec5twkeZbDNTN8FrH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regarding battery life, Soundcore rates the Liberty 5 for eight hours of playback with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) enabled.

My go-to choice right now is the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro, but I've been using Bose's QuietComfort Ultra for close to a month now, and they've been incredible.</p><p>The QuietComfort Ultra aren't affordable by any measure; they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-World-Class-Cancellation/dp/B0CD2FSRDD">retail for $299 on Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-in-ear-earbuds-lunar-blue/6589910.p?skuId=6589910">Best Buy</a>, and that's $100 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56">more than the Sony WF-1000XM5</a> (which are on sale from their $299 retail). Annoyingly, Bose's earbuds miss out on niceties like wireless charging, which is available on most $100 models these days. The case is on the bulkier side as well, and while it is still pocketable, I don't get why it's so much bigger than most other products in this category.</p><p>Thankfully, that's about the only drawback I've had with the QuietComfort Ultra; these earbuds combine a great fit with a fabulous bass-heavy sound signature, and they easily connect to two devices at once. The best part is that with Snapdragon Sound integration, you can unlock higher-quality streams — if you've got a phone that also has the requisite codecs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2hy7wUhkYg4ho5adkUnqwe" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2hy7wUhkYg4ho5adkUnqwe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I used the QuietComfort Ultra with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> as the phone comes with Snapdragon Sound as well, and it was a good pairing.

Phone manufacturers are doing a much better job in this area, and the recent slate of earbuds from Samsung, Google, and Xiaomi deliver a vibrant sound with plenty of useful extras. But with the QuietComfort Ultra, it's evident that Bose put its learnings from previous QuietComfort models to good effect, because they sound incredible.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mMRnQcPoB9TNi6PTZEjrfe" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mMRnQcPoB9TNi6PTZEjrfe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The earbuds have an engaging bass with excellent rumble and dynamics, and this makes listening to most modern music highly engaging.

While not a 10-band EQ, you get the ability to tweak the mass, mids, and treble, and it is nifty. It's easy to set up custom modes and adjust the level of noise isolation and immersive audio.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SXLBkCdMhYBLLT2GxSYq4f" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SXLBkCdMhYBLLT2GxSYq4f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Talking about isolation, the buds do a fantastic job in this regard. The ANC is easily the best of any earbuds around, and the earbuds are effective at reducing ambient noise, like the hum of an air conditioner, traffic sounds, or the whine of a jet engine when you're flying.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5040px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="wSvhwYzWCSghr4pGpRnJwe" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wSvhwYzWCSghr4pGpRnJwe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5040" height="2839" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's the fit; the buds are noticeably bigger than their rivals, and while I wasn't sure about the fit when I got started, they don't exert much pressure on the ear canal, and are great to wear for hours on end. The distinctive design with a bulbous shell makes the buds highly comfortable to wear, and while you don't get as secure a fit as the buds don't nestle into your ear cavity quite as much, I didn't have any problems doing chores around the house with these on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gboYghvM9ZtrNNT6irvMue" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gboYghvM9ZtrNNT6irvMue.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Connectivity is via Bluetooth 5.3, and the earbuds have Google Fast Pair, so it was easy to connect to various devices.

This appearance was likely for its rumored chip, which the leak claims is MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC. Strangely, the publication reports the tablet scored "lower than smartphones" with MediaTek's flagship chip.</p><p>The Geekbench listing reportedly states the S11 Ultra achieved a score of 5,312 in its multi-core test and 1,420 in the single-core run.</p><p>There were some smaller specs posted in the listing, like the existence of Android 16 and 12GB of RAM. Still no word on its internal storage; however, there's a chance Samsung could pop 256GB in it to match that 12GB of RAM, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><h2 id="an-ultra-look-2">An Ultra Look</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra leaks bring new information forward while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-battery-specifications-leak">also switching up the narrative</a> on a key specification: its SoC of choice. In a previous leak, the tablet was rumored to receive MediaTek's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400</a> SoC from late last year. This chip was the company's flagship response to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. However, what this alleged Geekbench listing purports is the brand's updated (and upgraded) variant.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus</a> offers a Big Core design with one Arm Cortex-X925 core at 3.73GHz. The company was adamant during its launch that this chip could "propel" users' experience with Android UX. What's more, the chip is paired with the 12-core Arm Immortalis-G925 GPU for "PC-like" graphical features on Android phones.</p><p>The SoC launched in April, and it seems Samsung could opt for this leveled-up version of MediaTek's flagship prowess.</p><p>Other Galaxy Tab S11 series rumors claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">will drop the Plus model in 2025</a>, bringing back its base model, which was absent last year. While the base model could see a familiar 8,160mAh battery, the Ultra model might jump 500mAh to ~11,374mAh.</p><p>Speculation claims Samsung might hold onto its next flagship tablet series until after its summer Unpacked. This means we might not see them until the fall at the latest.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ipad-tablets-ereaders/tablets/pcmcat209000050008.c?id=pcmcat209000050008"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=tablet"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/tablets-laptops-computers-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablet&crid=2HCFROTF588S1&sprefix=tablet%2Caps%2C159&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Google states this alternative overview is said to leverage the latest Gemini models for "quick, conversational" results for "certain" queries. Google remains confident that this feature (in testing) can help users understand information with convenience.</p><p>After searching, it seems Google's Audio Overviews in Search will appear as an option for users to receive. The post states testers will notice a "generate" button if the feature is available for that particular query.</p><p>If you opt into it, Audio Overviews will be housed in their own contained space within your results. Marked by a "Search Labs" experience label, the overview will inform users about what it entails. For example, users would see a "Listen to..." starter, followed by whatever the topic is you've searched for, like noise cancellation in headphones.</p><p>Following that is the Audio Overview itself, with a play button and how long Google's AI will be speaking about the subject. Similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-year-later-research-report">Search's regular AI Overviews</a>, users will see citations detailing where the model got its information.

Additionally, if this interests you, users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/30">join the Search Labs experience</a> to begin trying it today (June 13).</p><p>Google's AI Overviews have continued to evolve; however, this alternative mirrors what was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">given through NotebookLM</a>. In September, Google rolled out Audio Overviews to NotebookLM, a journal-based app that lets users go in-depth with their research/learning for better understanding. For this app, Audio Overviews utilized two AI "co-hosts" for a conversational, podcast-like creation.</p><p>One primary difference here is that NotebookLM's version leverages information contained within <em>your </em>documents. The AI tries its best to condense this information in a way that facilitates better understanding. Additionally, users can guide these AI toward specific talking points and even pose questions.</p><p>Google's version in this Search test seems restricted to the AI delivering its best version of condensed information for the user. There's a chance the company could bring similar NotebookLM features to Search, but that remains speculative for now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

From the stand's blown-up render, it seems the Korean OEM has succeeded in trimming down the next book-style Fold. The device is partly open in this shot, giving us a look at each half, which appears much thinner than the Fold 6.</p><p>The foldable still retains its rounded corners on the right half of its frame. However, another point of interest is its hinge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:476px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:126.05%;"><img id="3HTwojuYbV4CaoxhyufQde" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-promotional-thinner-photo" alt="A photo of Samsung's promotional standee for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which appears much thinner than the Fold 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3HTwojuYbV4CaoxhyufQde.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="476" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The hinge, which can be responsible for giving a much larger size to the foldable, might've slimmed down slightly for this next iteration. With that, there's a chance that when folded, the Fold 7's displays will sit much closer together, especially toward the hinge. Typically, there's a bit of a gap there due to its functionality, but Samsung may cut this down even more than it did with its predecessor.</p><h2 id="a-foldable-summer-with-a-bigger-camera-bump-2">A Foldable Summer... with a bigger camera bump?</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge">galaxyfold</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge">r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Aside from that, another GalaxyFold subreddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge/">post by a separate user</a> highlights a leaked look at an upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 case (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/13/galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-bump-leak/">9to5Google</a>). While this is a Thinborne case, the purpose of this photo is the camera bump and how large it seems to be. From the angled top view, things appear quite nominal. However, when shown the side view, the Fold 7's camera bump protrudes quite harshly from the back of the device.</p><p>There's something to note here: the Fold 7's triple camera array (in older leaked imagery) sits on an elevated island. Moreover, the leaked case's protection is likely ever-so-slightly higher than the island to protect the lenses when set down.</p><p>Either way, as the original poster notes, "The thickness of the camera bump is almost just as thick as the phone itself (in folded mode)."</p><p>Something a little more "concrete" to look at would be a recent leak from May, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/someone-got-their-hands-on-the-alleged-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-heres-the-first-look">as a user allegedly got their hands on</a> the Fold 7 early. Wrapped in plastic, the user took a photo of the device in question, showing off its triple camera array with black rings, similar to its past version, and the direction <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">the Galaxy S25</a> has gone. It was unclear just how large Samsung's camera island for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 would be, but this latest leaked render from Reddit might've given us all we need to know.</p><p>More than that, rumors claim the Fold 7 is roughly 4.5mm when unfolded, which is a bit thinner than the Fold 6's ~5.6mm measurement.</p><p>The Fold 7 is also purported to provide a huge 200MP camera, finally moving away from 50MP. Considering the camera bump's supposed increase, these camera upgrades could be the culprit, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">we've seen Google discuss before</a> with its Pixel 9.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Although "smarter" watches and wearables replaced the brand, founder Eric Migicovsky is bringing the concept back under a new company called Core Devices. Roughly a half-year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/hell-yeah-theyre-bringing-pebble-watches-back">after Migicovsky first announced his plans</a>, the refreshed Core 2 Duo watch is about to start shipping to customers and a new app is on the way.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/core-2-duo-alphabeta-test-signup" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Migicovsky confirms that Core Devices has already built 200 units of the Core 2 Duo watch, and it's nearing mass production. The company is on track to ship all pre-orders for the Core 2 Duo in July and August, and some beta testers will get their orders early. The Core Time 2 is a bit further out from mass production and shipping, but Migicovsky says it's still on schedule, with engineering samples slated for next month.</p><p>As part of the "RePebble" project, Google generously open-sourced PebbleOS, helping make the entire endeavor possible. That doesn't just benefit buyers of new Core Devices products, but also existing Pebble users and at-home tinkerers. Anyone can play around with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/coredevices/pebbleos" target="_blank">PebbleOS on GitHub</a>. More importantly, Migicovsky's reboot may give new life to people who still have a working Pebble watch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K" name="pebble-core-duo-2-time-2-smartwatches-hero" alt="A rendering depicting Core Devices' new PebbleOS smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and the Time 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2037" height="1146" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"You can join the test even if you didn’t pre-order a Core 2 Duo," Migicovsky writes, "if you have an old working Pebble Time (Steel/Round) or Pebble 2 watch, you can join the beta to help test the new iOS and Android mobile app."</p><p>"Our new app works with your old Pebble!"</p><p>Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forms.gle/iRK9MoW8v7th5RVHA" target="_blank">sign up for the beta test here</a>, but be warned, Migicovsky says this project is only for people willing to avoid public criticism and provide detailed reports and feedback. "This is actually going to be a lot of fun (for the right person)," he writes. "I just want to make sure we're on the same page."</p><p>For people with a Core 2 Duo pre-order, expect an email confirmation this month to work out the final shipping details for your order. That includes providing a shipping address and "to pay duties/tariffs/taxes for your country." As of now, it seems Core Devices' Pebble refresh is close to becoming a reality.</p><p>You can pre-order a Core Devices watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.repebble.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature is wrapped in Google's recent stretch of June <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">Google System Release patches</a>, specifically for its Play Services. The company details this as a "Safety & Emergency" update, stating Wear OS users will soon see alerts "when an earthquake is expected."</p><p>Rahman reiterates that Google's been working on this for a few months now, after a teardown surfaced a few details.</p><p>According to the post, these earthquake alerts on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS devices</a> will display the quake's "magnitude" and "estimated distance to the epicenter." Users should, of course, take this information seriously if it ever happens and take the appropriate action to ensure their safety. Moreover, it seems Google is putting a blanket over every Wear OS user, bringing this feature to more than just "high-risk" areas, as it has done before on Android.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google's Play Services update for June includes a few bug fixes related to its Wallet app and developer updates for "Account Management" in apps. Google's changelog announced this safety feature last week, but it appears to be rolling out very slowly.</p><h2 id="ahead-of-danger-2">Ahead of Danger</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-trekking-poles" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting atop a pair of trekking poles, with the watch face including a step count of 11,800." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google first launched its Earthquake Alerts System back in 2020 and expanded its access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-earthquake-alerts-system-expands-greece-new-zealand">to more countries in 2021</a>. Essentially, the system turns your phone into a portable seismometer using its accelerometer to detect changes in the planet. The information your phone detects is sent to Google's servers, which are then "crowdsourced" with other Android phones to see if a quake is truly happening.</p><p>If confirmed, Google's system will alert all Android users within the quake's range to get to safety.

You&apos;ll also enjoy seven years of OS/security upgrades and all of the latest AI-boosted software features straight out of the box.</p><p>In addition, the Unlimited plan from Mint Mobile provides unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile&apos;s legendary 5G network, plus you&apos;ll get a mobile hotspot and free calls to Mexico, Canada, and the UK. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4183px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3fBjYdhmrr5uPkU5Lt25mb" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-19.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 next to a bush" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fBjYdhmrr5uPkU5Lt25mb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4183" height="2353" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deal</a> sounds familiar, it&apos;s probably because it&apos;s very similar to a promo that the carrier was running on the Pixel 9 earlier this year. The difference is that the old offer was only slashing $400 off the phone and 50% off <em>one year</em> of wireless, instead of the BOGO deal we&apos;re seeing today. Both offers are exceptional, but having my phone bill covered for a year sounds too good to pass up. </p><p>The problem is that some folks may not want to commit to a single data plan for two years.

You can run this sample version alongside your current data plan for a week with no interruptions, and the Pixel 9 deal above <em>should </em>still be around when the trial is up.

This is where we'll likely see the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, Galaxy Watch 8, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">Project Moohan</a> (likely) or a Galaxy Ring 2 (less likely). Needless to say, Unpacked is going to be packed to the gills.</p><p>I can't help but notice that Samsung's messaging to this point has largely been focused on the larger Galaxy foldable. It started with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-drops-a-swift-tease-for-a-potential-z-fold-ultra">teaser</a>, showcasing a silhouette of a book-style foldable, accompanied by a caption reading "Meet the next chapter of Ultra." Then, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-promises-sleek-durable-galaxy-z-series-incoming">blog post</a> was published that focuses on how the unknown device is "Thin, Light, and Built to Last."</p><p>The most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-teases-ai-camera-with-situational-awareness-for-galaxy-z-fold-7-ultra">teaser</a> focuses on the camera system and how AI is expected to improve, arguably the most frustrating aspect of the previous model. Given the constant flow of features from Google, courtesy of tools like Gemini Live, I would expect this to be the case.</p><h2 id="the-lack-of-confidence-is-evident-2">The lack of confidence is evident</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, a recent report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=36892">The Elec</a> suggests Samsung has lowered its projected sales figures for both the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7. The report notes that in May alone, Samsung was expected to produce approximately 1.6 million units, with the Fold 7 accounting for 800,000 units. Now, that figure has reportedly been lowered to around 1.34 million devices, with the Fold 7 dropping to around 630,000 units.</p><p>Assuming the report is correct, which should always be taken with a grain of salt, I'm left wondering what's going on. For one, I don't recall the last time Samsung started building this much hype for its foldable phones ahead of an official announcement, at least not with this kind of cadence.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="bWHFWV8EWSvYqs6RX48iLZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-series-gif" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 7 teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bWHFWV8EWSvYqs6RX48iLZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, why is Samsung trying to hype a product that it reportedly expects to fall short of its targets? The obvious answer is that Samsung could just be hoping to exceed expectations for the first time in years. But to me, something about the whole situation just doesn't sit right.</p><p>Could Samsung actually introduce a Galaxy Z Fold Ultra? I doubt it. There are numerous factors that work against this idea, particularly in the context of the ongoing trade and tariff dispute in the United States. Furthermore, the economic climate in this region is far too volatile, and an "Ultra" foldable would likely surpass the $2,000 mark, making it out of reach for many.</p><h2 id="falling-behind-2">Falling behind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7jwzkz8wDPWgfTrWxwfqq4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7jwzkz8wDPWgfTrWxwfqq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No matter what comes of the 2025 Galaxy Z Fold family, if it doesn't meet Samsung's expectations, they really only have themselves to blame. Although the software experience is as great as it gets compared to the competition, Samsung has fallen far behind in the design department.</p><p>Other foldable phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review" target="_blank">Oppo Find N5</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review" target="_blank">Honor Magic V3,</a> make the Galaxy Z Fold 6 look a few years older than it actually is. Not to mention that both of those devices offer better camera hardware, bigger batteries, and less noticeable creases.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="n2Z8YQi3u6AvPaiK8xDsFM" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold inner screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n2Z8YQi3u6AvPaiK8xDsFM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is quick to point and laugh at Apple, but it's also one of the first to follow in Apple's footsteps. This is exactly what happened with the Fold lineup, as Samsung only made minor tweaks to the hardware, resulting in a phone that didn't look much different from the one before it.</p><p>Instead of being the industry leader it should be, Samsung sat back and coasted for too long, and the people responded with their wallets. Proof of that came <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-9-pro-fold-a-crowd-favorite-in-europe">via Counterpoint Research</a>, which reported that Samsung "saw a 24% drop in sales in Q1 this year."</p><h2 id="what-about-a-galaxy-fold-fe-2">What about a Galaxy Fold FE?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bgGzMBiUX8b7cH9Tj5kZaM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-12.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgGzMBiUX8b7cH9Tj5kZaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there's the potential for Samsung to launch a cheaper Galaxy Z Fold FE to boost sales. However, I don't think that's an avenue Samsung should pursue, with the sole exception of being a cash grab.</p><p>Why? Well, that's easy. Samsung hasn't proven that it can make a foldable that keeps pace with the Oppo Find N5 or Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Software-wise, yes, the Fold 6 is the clear winner. Hardware is another story.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW" name="multi-window-galaxy-z-fold-6.jpg" alt="Multi-window apps on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are rumors that Samsung may release an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-is-likely-coming-in-2025">FE version of the Galaxy Z Flip</a>.

It's just not something that I think should exist, yet.

Unfortunately, this was only available in Samsung's home country of South Korea, arriving just a few months after the Z Fold 6 was released.</p><p>The Special Edition introduced upgraded cameras, a slimmer design, larger screens, and basically everything we've been wanting. Besides the limited availability, the only thing that's missing is S Pen support, a change that we can only hope won't come to the Fold 7.</p><p>At the end of the day, I'm still holding out hope for the "no-compromise" foldable from Samsung.

Recently, Nothing's CEO Carl Pei sat down with the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/nothings-new-phone-3-will-be-available-for-general-sale-in-the-us/">TechCrunch</a> to discuss the phone's availability, specifically in the North American region.</p><p>Speaking to the publication, Pei pointed out that the company always had plans to bring the new flagship model to the U.S. "We have always said we are building for the long term, and now we’re ready to take that next step in the U.S. Phone (3) is not just another launch. It is a signal of where we are as a company," he added.</p><p>As for the availability of the device, the publication notes that, Phone 3 will support AT&T and T-Mobile coverage in the U.S. with multi-band support for 4G and 5G — broadening its carrier compatibility from its previous models. The Nothing Phone 3 will also be sold via the company's website and on Amazon.</p><p>Additionally, TechCrunch mentions, Nothing is partnering with Best Buy to sell its new flagship, along with its first-ever over-ear headphone model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-will-launch-its-first-over-the-ear-headphones-in-july-along-with-phone-3">Headphone 1</a>, that is set to launch on July 1 as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Historically, Nothing's flagship phones have been somewhat difficult to obtain in the U.S. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-hands-on-preview-impressions" target="_blank">Phone 1</a> was not officially released for general sale in the U.S., but was made available through a "Beta Membership" program. Things changed with the company's second flagship, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>, which was generally available for sale in the US and Canada.</p><p>Carl Pei has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-ceo-carl-pei-reassures-fans-phone-3-is-definitely-coming-to-the-u-s" target="_blank">indicated as much </a>back in April, when a fan asked if the Nothing Phone 3 "is coming to the U.S. besides on your beta channel?" Pei replied, saying "100%," with the American flag emoji next to it.</p><p>Furthermore, the publication stated that the company saw a significant number of users switching from other brands to Nothing, which is why it plans to intensify efforts to attract even more North American customers. Pei added that the U.S. smartphone market is dominated by two players (likely Samsung and Apple), and that people are seeking a change from this norm.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Come to Play.Phone (3). 1 July, 18:00 BST. pic.twitter.com/9afIpKao1s<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1929870704968606029">June 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Nothing phones are known for their distinctive design, including the customizable Glyph Interface and transparent elements, which set them apart from most other major smartphones on the market. This visual identity has been a unique selling point for the company, and that's what the CEO seems to be depending upon with the Phone 3 as well.</p><p>"This is the right product, and the right moment, to start scaling in North America,” Pei confirmed.</p> ]]></dc:content>
