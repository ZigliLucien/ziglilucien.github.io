Infinix in particular saw a lot of success with its GT series of devices over the last two years; I enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/infinix-gt-10-pro-review">GT 10 Pro</a>, and the GT 20 Pro built on that foundation.</p><p>The GT 30 Pro was just announced, and the phone is all set to make its debut in India. Ahead of its global launch, I had an email interaction with Infinix's Product Director Weiqi Nie to get a better sense of what the brand is doing differently this time around, and how it is positioning the GT series.</p><p>Design has always been a key selling point of previous GT models, and Infinix has doubled down in that area with the GT 30 Pro. The phone has a "cyber-mecha" design aesthetic that looks plain cool, and while the GT 10 Pro looked like a derivative of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">Nothing's phones</a>, that is definitely not the case with the GT 30 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tyNi3DxbnxLcuatnc4kCNg" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyNi3DxbnxLcuatnc4kCNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nie noted that Infinix took inspiration from "futuristic machines and modular aesthetics" in designing the device. "Over time, this concept has evolved to be more expressive, functional, and aligned with the needs of modern gamers. In the GT 30 Series, this vision comes to life through the upgraded Mechanical Light Waves system. Built on deep integration between software and hardware design, it delivers 14 lighting scenarios and over 20 customizable effects that respond dynamically to actions like charging, gaming, and notifications."</p><p>Infinix basically wanted to deliver a phone with a bold design, and thanks to the custom pattern at the back and vibrant lighting, the GT 30 Pro manages to stand out quite a bit. Of course, while design is a consideration, the biggest factor when choosing a gaming phone is the performance.</p><p>Infinix went with MediaTek instead of Qualcomm, and Nie said the Dimensity 8350 offered the brand the ideal mix of high frame rate gaming and thermal management. "MediaTek’s platform offered the right combination of performance, efficiency, and scalability to bring the GT 30 Pro’s vision to life. The Dimensity 8350 Ultimate delivers smooth high-frame-rate gaming, effective thermal control, and optimized power usage—crucial for maintaining consistent performance across both gaming and daily use."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rteJ7SdkHegBdRDWiQw9jh" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rteJ7SdkHegBdRDWiQw9jh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8000" height="4500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"The Dimensity 8350 Ultra's capabilities provided the performance headroom needed to integrate features like a 144Hz AMOLED display, advanced cooling solutions, and responsive gaming enhancements, without compromising on price accessibility. This approach allows the GT 30 Pro to deliver a flagship-level experience that is designed for a broader range of users."</p><p>Overheating continues to be an issue on gaming phones, with this year's Qualcomm chipsets in particular having a higher thermal threshold. Thankfully, that isn't the case with MediaTek designs, and Nie said sustained performance is a "core priority" on the GT 30 Pro, particularly during longer gaming sessions. The GT 30 Pro features Infinix’s 3D Vapor Cloud Chamber (3D VCC) liquid cooling tech, and Nie noted that the brand does "intelligent software optimization that dynamically manages power and thermal behavior based on real-time usage."</p><p>There are two accessories as well — the MagCase and MagCharge Cooler — with the latter being an active cooling solution that funnels cool air to the back of the device. "The GT 30 Pro takes a system-level approach—combining a high-performance chipset, efficient cooling, and smart charging solutions such as Bypass Charging 2.0 and optimized wireless charging with active cooling. This ensures stable, high frame rates over long periods, without overheating or throttling—even while charging."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4JjRAKuu63zcutuZDLXCNg" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4JjRAKuu63zcutuZDLXCNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll be testing the GT 30 Pro's prowess in this regard, and having used other MediaTek mid-range designs, I'm excited to see what the phone brings to the table. The GT 30 Pro also retains ultrasonic triggers, allowing gamers to assign in-game actions with relative ease — they make a genuine difference while gaming.</p><p>The phone gets a 144Hz panel, and what I like the most is that it unlocks 120fps in demanding titles including PUBG Mobile. Like other brands catering to this niche, the GT 30 Pro is aimed at a younger audience, and the design and visual aesthetic reflects that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oHcutDg8hGeJJ6d2JkJLNg" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oHcutDg8hGeJJ6d2JkJLNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Infinix is focused on phones, Nie said the brand is looking to build an ecosystem of gaming devices under the "GT Verse" umbrella. "GT Verse is a full-stack experience designed around the needs of mobile gamers. In addition to the GT 30 Pro, the lineup is expanding with GT Buds 4 with 30dB ANC and low-latency Game Mode, the GT Power bank with 55W multi-device fast charging, and even a dedicated cooling accessory under development."</p><p>"This ecosystem approach allows users to stay connected, powered, and immersed across devices—whether they’re gaming at home or on the move. While future product plans will be guided by community feedback and innovation readiness, the GT Series will remain at the core of Infinix’s long-term vision to serve gamers with purpose-built tools across categories."</p><p>Pricing is a big part of what makes a budget gaming phone succeed, and Infinix is targeting a $300 price point with the device. Given that there aren't that many gaming-focused phones in this category, the aggressive positioning combined with the feature-set of the device should allow the GT 30 Pro to win out against its rivals. With an imminent launch in India, we don't have to wait too long to know more about the GT 30 Pro, and I'll have more to share on the device in the coming days.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One UI 8 brings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> to the Galaxy S25 for the first time, letting select users try out new features before they're publicly released to everyone.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>For the most part, One UI 8 is an iterative update with UI tweaks and new feature additions for several of Samsung's core apps, including Samsung Health, Reminders, Routines, Internet, Calendar, Contacts, and more.</p><p>The update also refreshes important parts of the UI, including a revamped Quick Share UI that makes it easier to send and receive files, additional accessibility options for users with sight and hearing impairments, plus fixes for hard-to-find UI elements like Auracast.</p><p>While the update includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-launches-one-ui-8-beta-program-the-first-generation-upgrade-starting-with-the-new-galaxy-foldables">dozens of changes</a>, I've picked out my eight favorite, with a few follow-up favorites found during my time with the beta on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><h2 id="ai-select-meets-speed-racer-2">AI Select meets Speed Racer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="XMEFwbEK2PPeXScvwjoerc" name="one-ui-7-vs-8-ai-select" alt="Timing the difference between AI Select speeds on One UI 7 vs One UI 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XMEFwbEK2PPeXScvwjoerc.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With One UI 7, Samsung upgraded its aging Smart Select tool to what it now calls AI Select, adding important context-sensitive actions that make the tool far more useful than it used to be. But it took seemingly <em>forever</em> to start up in One UI 7 and got quite irritating to use on a regular basis.</p><p>That's been completely fixed in One UI 8. It used to take roughly 5 seconds from tapping the "AI Select" button to the time you could actually select content on your screen. Now, tapping AI select makes the feature effectively immediately available, taking me about 2 seconds to circle an image on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display.</p><h2 id="multitasking-is-90-10-better-2">Multitasking is 90:10 better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4hVGob4XuQ4MsH2zhq85C3" name="one-ui-8-multitasking-improvements-split-screen" alt="Using the new 90:10 multitasking feature on One UI 8 and Android 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4hVGob4XuQ4MsH2zhq85C3.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> came out in 2023, it blew our minds for several reasons, but the phone's multitasking capabilities were among the best features to use daily. Paramount to that was something called OnePlus Canvas, a feature that let you dock an app to 10% of one side of the screen and quickly switch between any running app by tapping the window.</p><p>Android 16 and One UI 8 have adopted this 90:10 feature, as it's called, letting you resize a split window down to 10% of its normal size. This lets you easily juggle two apps with a single tap without feeling like the app is squashed, as normal split screen tends to feel. Holy cow is it ever a massive upgrade on the normal split window multitasking, and it'll give me a reason to finally use more than one app at a time.</p><h2 id="quick-share-got-some-quicker-tweaks-2">Quick Share got some quicker tweaks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPWT73kpbCYUqedEyrxnWA" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-quick-share" alt="Comparing the Quick Share UI between One UI 7 and One UI 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPWT73kpbCYUqedEyrxnWA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Quick Share has been one of the most useful additions to Android in quite some time, but receiving files from people who aren't contacts has been a bit of a hassle. A fancy new UI change from Samsung makes this much easier, and it all starts when you tap the Quick Share button in the quick toggles pane.</p><p>The familiar Send screen is still the default when opening Quick Share, but a new Receive tab makes it simple to quickly get files from anyone so long as the window is open. No more selecting from the "no one, contacts only, or everyone" options. Just open the Receive window and you're good to go, no matter who the other person is.</p><h2 id="more-powerful-reminders-and-routines-2">More powerful reminders and routines</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p3S64SVHg9ZjWBeSkYVaN9" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-reminders-app" alt="Comparing the changes in the Reminders app between One UI 8 and One UI 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3S64SVHg9ZjWBeSkYVaN9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the dumber things Google ever did was remove the ability to add a location to reminders in Google Assistant. That makes tools like Samsung's Reminder app much better to use, as you cna have it remind you of something when you get to a location, at a certain and or date, and more. The upgraded Reminders app now also includes quick category buttons at the top, making it easy to find everything you need at a glance.</p><p>Routines also got an upgrade, now letting you select from new preset routines like weather, which is pretty slick if you need a reminder to grab your umbrella or rain coat before it rains, or sunscreen when the cloudy days end.</p><h2 id="samsung-health-gets-a-bulk-up-2">Samsung Health gets a bulk up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-running-together" alt="The Together feature in the Samsung Health app on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once upon a time, I tried to log my food intake so I could track calories, macros, and just do better. The problem is that I always forgot to input my meals, and wouldn't remember until I had forgotten the exact details of what I ate. Now, Samsung Health can remind you to log meals throughout the day, circumventing this common problem.</p><p>As you eat better, you can also now use the power of peer pressure to help you workout more often. An upgraded Together feature in Samsung Health lets you issue run distance challenges to all your contacts, setting goals to be the first to run a specific distance each week.

We don't need big overhauls every release. It's just not necessary. So, Samsung is focused on making One UI 7 even better with helpful features and changes that seem to make a lot of sense. Even the weather app, seen above, has a more realistic feel, giving you a better idea of the weather the moment you open it.</p><p>Some users on Reddit have reported bugs already, which makes sense since this is a beta release. If you want to check out One UI 8 early, open the Samsung Members app on your Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, or Galaxy S25 Ultra, then tap the One UI 8 Beta option in the image carousel at the top. Once you're enrolled, it'll download and install the system update. We don't recommend doing this on your only phone, as bugs could cause problems for any number of apps.</p><p>If you come across a bug, use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/troubleshoot/TSG10003603/">bug reporting tool</a> to let the developers know so that they can get it fixed in the next beta release. This helps everyone — not just you — so users are encouraged to use the tool as often as possible, even if Samsung knows the bug already exists. This is Samsung's fastest One UI update ever, and it's great to see Samsung working so hard to deliver on that seven year update promise for the Galaxy S25 series so quickly.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company demoted all the ways you can quickly build custom web apps with Gemini, and specifically Canvas, its AI-powered workspace for coding and much more. There's skepticism <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tech-talk-can-you-really-build-an-app-or-game-with-an-ai-chatbot">about whether AI can really build an app</a>, and that may be why Google built a web app of its own using Gemini that you can try out right now.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/gemini-canvas-stats-io-2025/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google explained its process for building the web app, which is designed to highlight some announcements from I/O in a fun and engaging format. The company asked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to "analyze the transcript from the keynote, pull out some impressive numbers and offer explanations of them." After that, Google says it made "just a few tweaks to ensure accuracy."</p><p>That led to the creation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/share/c30bda1a3edb" target="_blank">Google I/O 2025: By the numbers</a>, an interactive web app made almost entirely using Gemini. Numbers are displayed in a flipboard-style format, and you can click or tap a number to read the corresponding fact from the I/O keynote. It's a neat way to recap what you missed from the event, and get a glimpse of how Gemini can be used as a coding agent.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4448px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.17%;"><img id="wVVc3WYj97ot8L6CTmGjd7" name="Gemini-Web-App-IO-2" alt="A screenshot of the Gemini web app for Google I/O highlights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVVc3WYj97ot8L6CTmGjd7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4448" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4436px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.35%;"><img id="69qLBRzPNFUkVdTvzFqzf7" name="Gemini-Web-App-IO-1" alt="A screenshot of the Gemini web app for Google I/O highlights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/69qLBRzPNFUkVdTvzFqzf7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4436" height="2278" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Since you're exploring the Gemini web app directly in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-new-features-canvas-audio-overviews">Canvas</a>, you can play around with the preview of the web app itself or view the code used to create it.

When clicking Gemini's starry icon, its side panel will now display a text box detailing the "summarized content." Users can interact with this drop-down menu for quick bites of information without having to sit through a lengthy video.</p><p>However, summarizing a video's content isn't all Gemni is capable of in this patch.</p><p>Google highlights the AI model's ability to list "action items" from a video. Action items are direct calls for you (the viewer) to do something. Google uses the example of a planning video, which tells the user to finalize a campaign schedule and secure a location for its "spring pop-up." If Gemini detects things like this, it will list them under the "list action items" function in the side panel.</p><p>Additionally, Gemini's newfound video capabilities pave the way for specific user questions. You can ask the AI to list any video highlights and more, depending on the context of the video.</p><h2 id="gemini-in-workspace-continues-2">Gemini in Workspace Continues</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:966px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.11%;"><img id="LovNCCgtPnZ5mTykhGEwsa" name="google-drive-gemini-action-items-example" alt="Google Drive's Gemini update brings the ability for users to tell the AI to list "action items" from within a video without the user needing to watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LovNCCgtPnZ5mTykhGEwsa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="966" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect, this feature is rolling out for Google Workspace customers.

You've heard of them even if you didn't know it; companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cricket-unlimited-adds-hbo-max-ads-its-unlimited-plan-free">Cricket Wireless</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/mint-mobile-reduces-rates-to-dollar15-per-month-with-a-deflation-initiative">Mint Mobile</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-fi/google-fi-wireless-celebrates-10-years-with-a-new-affordable-plan">Google Fi</a> are all MVNOs.</p><p>What that really means is that they lease giant amounts of usage rights from bigger carriers with actual infrastructure like towers and cables in place. Take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi Wireless</a>, for example. It's a separate company, but it runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvnos-use-t-mobiles-network" target="_blank">T-Mobile's</a> U.S. network, with many agreements outside of the U.S., allowing it to operate almost anywhere in the world.</p><p>The agreement means they are sort of like you, a customer of a major cellular carrier. Of course, they do things a lot differently and use a lot more of the network than you or I ever will.</p><p>Things get a little murky with some of these arrangements. What I mean is that a physical network carrier like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> can also run an MVNO that uses its network (in this case, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">Visible</a>).</p><p>The company books are kept separately, and there are different plans and rules, but the big company also owns the small company. I don't know why they choose this route versus offering different plans with similar pricing, but I'm sure it's a wise business decision. Carriers are <em>really</em> good at those.</p><h2 id="so-what-s-the-difference-2">So what's the difference?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pdwFo579iLkovNxVQuKadM" name="visible-sim-galaxy-s20-angle-wide.jpg" alt="Visible SIM card Galaxy S20+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdwFo579iLkovNxVQuKadM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While they seem to be duplicates of each other, they really aren't. There are three major differences between an MVNO and a "regular" carrier.</p><p>The first one, and what you might have read about on the internet, is that an MVNO can offer service at much cheaper rates. In some cases, prices are almost cut in half for what sounds like the same service plan on the same network. That's kind of true, but you need to know about the other two differences as well.</p><p>Next is the difference in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-access-visible-customer-support">customer service</a>. Now I'm not saying that big carriers like AT&T or Orange offer excellent customer service, but they do offer more help than you'll get from a typical MVNO. Cutting back on customer support staff is one of the ways that an MVNO can offer such cheap service. They won't leave you high and dry, but don't expect expert answers for every question you might have or a quick solution to every problem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg" name="T-Mobile-store-logo.jpg" alt="T-Mobile store logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, we have to talk about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/when-do-carriers-start-throttling-you-and-what-you-can-do-about-it">network deprioritization</a>. What sounds like a made-up word is a real thing, and it happens frequently in some places. When a network location gets really crowded and it starts to affect the quality of your connection, MVNO customers take a backseat to customers of the parent network.</p><p>I know that sounds confusing, so here's a real-world example of it in action: I use Google Fi for my carrier, but until recently, my wife used T-Mobile. Google Fi uses the T-Mobile network, so coverage and quality are the same 99% of the time. The one percent difference? If we take a trip to downtown D.C. for any sort of event, like seeing the cherry blossoms or for the July 4 fireworks show, my phone service sucks.</p><p>T-Mobile customers have priority when it comes to using the network, and MVNO customers, like me and my Google Fi phone, get to use what's left over. When it's super crowded and people are densely packed into a smaller area, your MVNO carrier connection can suffer. It's a real thing, even though you won't see it very often.</p><h2 id="should-you-use-one-or-should-you-stick-with-the-big-companies-2">Should you use one or should you stick with the big companies?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tBdrXjDvPJVp5k2dxT83oC" name="verizon-warehouse-logo.jpg" alt="Verizon logo in warehouse" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tBdrXjDvPJVp5k2dxT83oC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>If you make the switch to an MVNO, you will save money, that's for sure. But you need to be aware of and OK with the drawbacks.</p><p>Are you the type of person who doesn't want to hassle with problems? If you would rather <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-att-customer-phone-walk-in-repairs">carry your phone into the carrier store</a> and let them fix whatever is wrong, then an MVNO might not be for you.</p><p>A bigger issue is the coverage. I live way out in the suburbs and never see any depriorization issues in my day-to-day life. But as mentioned, they are there, and it does happen. If you live or work somewhere like Manhattan or Los Angeles, you might not get the quality of service you want when you use an MVNO, especially during peak times when people are using their mobile devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mMQxU6Q4cqf4T6qEvWyjrV" name="mint-mobile-16-9.jpg" alt="Mint Mobile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mMQxU6Q4cqf4T6qEvWyjrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mint Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What you<em> really</em> need to do is try it for yourself. All MVNOs offer a month-to-month service plan, and many even allow you a risk-free trial for just this purpose. Don't shut off your current service, but order a SIM card from any of the popular MVNOs that seem like a good fit and give it a try. If you can test under the worst conditions, like a holiday or during a sporting event, even better. Make sure you have service when and where you're going to need it.</p><p>If it doesn't work for you, that's OK. You can always try again next year, because the improvements carriers make to their networks also benefit the MVNOs that use their infrastructure.</p><p>If it does work, and you're okay with being your own first level of support, you can save yourself a significant amount of money.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, the company may be looking to fit these superb camera sensors into a smaller package for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26 series</a>. Samsung is planning to use an inkjet printing process to manufacturer thinner Galaxy S26 Ultra lenses, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=36403" target="_blank">The Elec</a> (translated to English).</p><p>A company subdivision, called Samsung Electro-Mechanics, is tasked with creating camera lenses for Galaxy devices, and will reportedly switch to the inkjet printing process (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/05/new-camera-optics-could-make-galaxy-s26-ultra-thinner-than-s25.html">Android Headlines</a>).</p><p>Currently, The Elec reports that Samsung uses film layers within camera lenses to reduce lighting issues during capture, like lens flare and ghosting. The extra layers add to the camera lens' overall thickness, which could be reduced if the film was swapped with a printed layer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JgxEwPQ7NTjprkdmDmYjpj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-camera-islands-01" alt="Comparing the size and shape of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra versus the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JgxEwPQ7NTjprkdmDmYjpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The inkjet printing process serves as a slimmer alternative to traditional lens films. It involves putting matte ink directly on the part of the camera lens known as the "rib" — this is the portion of the camera housing that takes in light from the lenses, pushing it towards the actual camera sensors. With less space needed between the lenses and the sensor, the camera housing as a whole can become more compact.</p><p>According to The Elec's report, Samsung previously shared this technology in a patent application in 2018, but it didn't end up being officially registered and patented.</p><p>With a thinner camera lens, it's possible that Samsung could reduce the size of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>'s camera bump. The company could also use the extra space to house bigger components, like a larger battery, but a smaller protrusion for the camera lenses is most likely. These reports are currently unconfirmed, so we'll have to wait until the Samsung Galaxy S26 is officially announced to know which changes are coming to the phone's camera system for certain.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-10-years-tips-tricks/">blog post</a>, Google brought out the birthday cake and two gifts (updates) to keep Photos on its A-game. To mark a decade, Google Photos is set to receive an updated, redesigned in-app editor. The post states this new editor will offer "AI-powered suggestions" when sprucing up your photos.</p><p>More than that, these suggestions will combine several of Google Photos' available AI editing tools for "quick edits." Users can browse through these suggested actions and see if they like the result. However, if you're more interested in one particular part of a photo, Google says you can tap on specific parts and still receive AI editing suggestions.</p><p>This update will hit Android in June, leaving iOS users to wait until "later this year."</p><p>The second update, though small, breathes new life into sharing Google Photos albums with QR codes. Rolling out today, users can "generate QR codes" to share with people nearby. Those scanning your code can view the album or add pictures.</p><h2 id="photos-extravaganza-2">Photos Extravaganza</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DeeWLu2zMq8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google slips in a few tips to keep Photos users on the ball, like the ability to hide certain people or places from Memories. To do this, the post instructs users to head into <strong>Photos > Settings > Preferences > Memories</strong>. From there, dates, people, and even pets can be hidden so you're not thrust into sad moments or moments of longing. Additionally, Google reminds users that they can search in Photos using keywords.</p><p>The app will be able to leverage your gallery to find instances of you in a dress or even you at a sporting event.</p><p>Google drops some analytical knowledge, touting that Photos has roughly 1.5 billion users every month, and over 9 trillion stored photos and videos.</p><p>Google Photos has had a couple of notable updates in the past year, like the patch that brought the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">Collections</a>" tab. This area replaced the app's old library, giving users a more intuitive, clean look at their albums, documents, and more. The update included a small change to its UI, placing more important options up top, while hiding away buttons for the Locked Folder down below.</p><p>A few months later, in late 2024, Google Photos brought in the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-updates-page-rollout">Updates</a>" page. Replacing the "Sharing" button, "Updates" gives users a full-on glimpse of new shared albums, photos, and group conversation updates. Let's also not forget that Google Photos is reportedly ready and waiting on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/early-google-photos-code-material-3-expressive-changes-spotted">Material 3 Expressive upgrade</a>, which might (hopefully) arrive soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the post highlights Google's efforts to combat a wide range of scams, there are still a few exploiting online users, such as customer support threats. These are scams involving nefarious persons who are posing as "legitimate support" to retrieve your personal information.</p><p>Google states users should be aware of these when browsing online; however, Chrome might offer some relief.</p><p>While the company has "long blocked ads" for third-party support, Chrome has recently received Gemini integration (specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-gemini-nano-available-for-all-android-apps">Gemini Nano</a>) to better detect and block potential scam attempts.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google states text messages are another area where scams remain prominent. Package tracking scams rank quite high, often trying to fool users into believing they must "pay additional fees." Another scam instance regards toll roads. Google says this type of attack shares a few similarities with package tracking scams, likely due to them being "orchestrated by the same bad actor groups."</p><p>For both attacks, Google says its Messages app has recently received real-time detection capabilities to alert/warn users before anything happens.</p><h2 id="google-advances-its-protections-2">Google Advances its Protections</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:283px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:212.01%;"><img id="wgE2mTmq2LAwGZfZBbn2TR" name="google-messages-advanced-scam-protection-example" alt="A Google Messages alert of a potential scam, which gives users the choice to "report and block" the phone number." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wgE2mTmq2LAwGZfZBbn2TR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="283" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Google brought awareness to Malvertising and Fake travel sites in its updated advisory report. Both attempts are largely at play when browsing, even affecting ads seen through Google Search. The company states it has focused more on weeding out these aggressors, taking the appropriate actions against violators of its online policies.</p><p>May was chock-full of Google looking to improve its security/defensive measures <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-android-scam-spam-notification-gemini-protection">against malicious users when browsing</a>. A few weeks ago, Google Chrome had an update that launched AI-powered warnings in the browser on Android. Courtesy of Gemini, Chrome will now inform users about potential scams/threats. Moreover, Chrome will also analyze notifications to see if those are malicious, too.</p><p>Leading up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">I/O 2025</a>, Google's Android Show detailed the company's new scam protections for calls and texts. One key aspect was Google's interest in furthering Android's software so it can "block certain actions" if it thinks you might be involved in a call scam. The Messages app has been upgraded with the ability to identify new scams, such as toll road/billing, crypto, financial impersonation, and more.</p><p>These updates build off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">Google's March feature drop</a>, which brought crucial security updates.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Rumor has it that the upcoming Google series will sport different camera setups, maybe even a downgrade, and that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-color-palette-series-rumor">alleged color scheme</a> will include a mixed assortment of shades across the board. But I'm not interested in any of these things. There's only one thing on my mind.</p><p>A question that keeps bouncing off the insides of my brain is whether the Pixel 10 will finally bump the embarrassing charging speed of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 series</a>. The base model Pixel 9 and mid-level Pixel 9 Pro charge at 27W, whereas the upper-tier Pixel 9 Pro XL charges at 37W wired charging speeds. None of these numbers presents Google in a positive light.</p><p>If you're wondering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-are-we-obsessed-with-charging-speeds">why I care about charging speeds</a> so much, it's quite straightforward. Until battery tech is more advanced and we can get multiple days of heavy use out of a single charge, fast charging will always be relevant, and this is an area Google has fallen behind in.</p><h2 id="how-did-google-let-it-get-this-far-2">How did Google let it get this far?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="npqHMbKcRLYuCJJAaRdiXF" name="google-pixel-9-45w-charger-02.jpg" alt="Charging the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Google's 45W Pixel charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npqHMbKcRLYuCJJAaRdiXF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Truly, what's more surprising is that Google had the gall to consistently disappoint us with the charging speeds of its flagship phones over the past few years. The Google Pixel 6 supported 21W wired charging, which isn't a whole lot different from the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro's 27W speed. In a span of three years, Google didn't bother to give this sector a proper boost.</p><p>I've given Samsung a hard time over the S25's outdated 25W charging speed, but at least the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a> support 45W fast charging. That's a notable difference in contrast to the Pixel 9 Pro XL's 37W charging speed.</p><p>How are such large brands even allowed to get away with such horrid charging specs? We celebrate these devices, award them with titles, call them the best of the best, and yet they continue to disappoint us.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9MJimwwhxTKiviNEQWibXE" name="google-pixel-9-charging-01.jpg" alt="Charging the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Google's 45W Pixel charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9MJimwwhxTKiviNEQWibXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Funny enough, I don't care about the camera setup as much as I do about the charging speed anymore. Why? That's because the Pixel family is already adept at photography and recycles old lenses anyway. We get a fantastic photography experience regardless of this fact.</p><p>I'm sure the Pixel 10 will have superb cameras, even if one of the Pixel 10 models features a downgraded primary or secondary lens. However, Google needs to pay a lot more attention to the charging speed.</p><p>What made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> such a big success is its reputation as the battery king. This mighty little device has a long-lasting battery that reduces the need to charge the Pixel 9a every day. Perhaps if the charging speed were faster, users wouldn't mind having to charge more often.</p><p>Speaking from personal experience, I couldn't go back to using the Pixel as my main device once I switched over to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a>. The battery and charging specs are indomitable, and once you become reliant on 100W charging and an all-day battery life, it's very hard to give it up.</p><p>I can't imagine how awful it will look <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-google-pixel-10-rumor-hints-at-pricing-changes">if Google actually raises the price of the Pixel 10 Pro XL by $100</a> but retains a lame charging speed like 37W or 40W. Will people still be interested in buying such an expensive Google Pixel phone with such lackluster charging specs? I don't think so.</p><p>On the other hand, if Google surprises us with 50W to 60W fast charging, that rumored $100 price hike might just be worth it for a lot of people, myself included.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6770c4f0-0720-448c-8c3d-5adbf038b137">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T8WTnYRAhZw6DGua2jptsk.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL official render - Porcelain - front and back"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best Pixel for now</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL boasts a 5,060mAh battery that lasts all day paired with 37W wired and 23W wireless charging.

Like the previous firmware, the One UI 8 focus is also on enhancing AI features on the Galaxy S25 series, and includes three key factors: "multimodal capabilities, UX tailored to different device form factors, and personalized, proactive suggestions."</p><p>The popular Now Bar and Now Brief features from One UI 7 will see notable improvements as they can now showcase even more customized insights and suggestions to help users stay on top of their tasks and keep with their daily routine with the help of AI.</p><p>Additionally One UI 8 is also providing settings where it allows users to enable processing the data only on the device.

Quick Share is also believed to be getting enhancements with this software update.</p><p>The lengthy changelog of the latest beta highlights even more features like the ability to find files easily even if the users don't know the file name they are looking for. Samsung Internet is also seeing a redesign to access the features quickly.

Some more improvements can be seen across Communication, Camera, Accessibility, and in Security and Privacy preferences.</p><p>Since the rollout has just begun, we could be seeing more of what's hidden in the One UI 8 beta, and it is still unclear whether the recently spotted new Weather app revamp and audio version of Now Brief summary made their way to the first beta firmware.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Some hate wearing a bulky Garmin watch to bed, but don't want to miss out on Body Battery data. Others want the same Garmin fitness data without the watch form factor, preferring to wear luxury watches during the day.</p><p>It appears these Garmin fans will finally get their wish, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://the5krunner.com/2025/05/23/garmin-is-making-a-whoop-competitor-out-soon/">The5krunner</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://garminrumors.com/report-garmin-preparing-to-launch-whoop-like-band-with-sleep-and-recovery-focus/">Garmin Rumors</a>) reports being "100% sure" that a Whoop-like Garmin armband will arrive by July or August 2025, based on a source, with some key details of what to expect from it.</p><p>Essentially, this "Garmin Sleep Band" — the name comes from a "source document" — will use LED indicators instead of a screen. Tap gestures will disable the silent vibration alarm or check the battery life. Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a>, this Sleep Band would use an optical sensor to detect a light sleep stage within your alarm window before waking you.</p><p>The leak isn't comprehensive, as we don't know pricing, design, or whether it'll require a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect Plus subscription</a> like the Whoop Band does. But it would fit a new niche for Garmin, which has stuck to chest straps like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-hrm-200-helped-me-realize-i-was-too-harsh-on-hrm-chest-straps">HRM 200</a> until now.</p><h2 id="a-basic-backup-or-fully-fleshed-device-2">A basic backup or fully-fleshed device?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NfMqGuYQorsmSpwdMiQuGk" name="COROS-Heart-Rate-Monitor-on-arm.jpeg" alt="The COROS Heart Rate Monitor worn on the author's arm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfMqGuYQorsmSpwdMiQuGk.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An armband could deliver insights and alarms while being less bulky and distracting than a Garmin watch. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin can take several paths with its Sleep Band, starting with one that sticks to its namesake and solely offers sleep tracking with an optical sensor. For people who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hate wearing a watch to bed</a>, that would solve the problem and (hopefully) keep the price low because of its specialization.</p><p>Ideally, the Garmin Sleep Band would have the newest Elevate v5 sensor found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-and-570-revealed-all-key-upgrades">Forerunner 970</a>, since that would deliver the most accurate HR and skin temperature data, along with standard Garmin overnight data like blood oxygen, heart rate variability (HRV), and the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/i-put-garmins-connect-trails-breathing-variations-and-rucking-sport-to-the-test">breathing variation</a> metric.</p><p>Ideally, the Garmin Sleep Band would capture active ECG or passive heart rhythm data, as well. Whoop even offers blood pressure data on its new, expensive Whoop MG, but I don't think Garmin needs to target "medical-grade" accuracy for this device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="TLrgkb32YSqxBvN99HLNBa" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-HRV-status" alt=""Last night HRV" graph on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TLrgkb32YSqxBvN99HLNBa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I like Garmin's nightly insights, but not having to wear my bulky Fenix 8 at night to get them. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the next level, the Garmin Sleep Band would support all-day health tracking, in order to properly measure things like Body Battery, daily readiness, and recovery. That seems like an obvious choice to substitute for a watch, even if you must check the Connect mobile app for the results.</p><p>But would this device automatically detect and track workouts like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">Whoop Band</a>? Most external Garmin sensors must pair with a watch, though the newest Garmin HRM 600 chest strap does standalone workouts.</p><p>Arm-based optical readings are generally more reliable than wrist-based ones. The Garmin Sleep Band could hypothetically boost your workout accuracy, with or without a watch. It might not match a chest strap's precision, but it would certainly be more comfortable.</p><p>That said, I doubt this Sleep Band would offer built-in GPS, an altimeter, or other Garmin watch perks. If it has an accelerometer and IP68 dust and water resistance, it can deliver the basics that people would want out of a fitness tracker.</p><h2 id="hoping-garmin-doesn-t-mess-this-up-2">Hoping Garmin doesn't mess this up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YvyYmzDnRuFiyV9WqGBXH5" name="whoop_4.0_recovery_ice_bath.jpg" alt="Whoop 4.0 Recovery Ice Bath" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YvyYmzDnRuFiyV9WqGBXH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Garmin's Whoop competitor will hopefully be thinner and subscription-free </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Whoop)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm intrigued by the idea of a Garmin Sleep Band. I love my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">$79 COROS HRM armband</a> for its HR accuracy and lightweight comfort at just 19g or 0.67oz. I could see this new Garmin product fitting the niche of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> at a more affordable price while staying hidden on your bicep, leaving your wrist and fingers for non-tech accessories.</p><p>However, the question is whether this Sleep Band is merely an accessory or a true competitor to the Whoop. A Whoop band is "free" but costs $200/year with the mandatory subscription. Garmin could easily undercut Whoop with a subscription-free rival band, but its priorities have changed recently.</p><p>Garmin watches are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/forerunner-570-and-970-have-made-garmin-tiered-strategy-clearer-than-ever">getting pricier than ever</a>. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">Garmin's latest earnings call</a>, it talked about finding ways to counterbalance tariffs, such as increased prices. I'm concerned that Garmin might make it too pricey as a "backup" device or emulate Whoop with a mandatory Connect Plus fee, propping up their membership numbers and profits in one swoop.</p><p>At the moment, the Connect Plus paywall is only for optional features like AI summaries, offline trails, and advanced data charts. So I'm going to assume, until told otherwise, that Garmin will stick to its usual business model.</p><p>And in <em>that</em> case, the Garmin Sleep Band will make plenty of long-time users happy by letting them take <em>off</em> their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> without losing access to the data they rely on.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Recently, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/16/gemini-prompt-bar-redesign-android/" target="_blank">overhauled the prompt bar</a>, and it now puts key tools like “Deep Research” and “Canvas” front and center. There’s also a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-app-search-history-results-spotted">new “Search History” feature spotted in the app</a>, letting you dig up old chats just by typing in keywords or topics.</p><p>Even with all the updates, Gemini still treats tablets and foldables like oversized phones. It’s the same cramped layout, just awkwardly stretched across a big screen, with plenty of wasted space and not much thought behind it.</p><h2 id="no-more-wasted-space-2">No more wasted space</h2><p>That long-overdue fix might finally be on the way. The folks over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-tablet-3561343/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> managed to unlock a tablet-friendly Gemini layout in the latest Google app beta (v16.20.48.sa.arm64). It looks a lot like the web version, complete with a left-hand sidebar for jumping into past chats. You’ll get to it with a hamburger menu on the side.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nz6u9iFI-7g" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>On top of that, the new layout throws in handy shortcuts to start fresh chats or dig through your old ones with a quick search.</p><p>Like on the web, the new tablet setup will toss a dropdown at the top so you can flip between Gemini models without breaking a sweat. The prompt bar is also getting a makeover, showing off neat buttons for “Video,” “Search,” “Research,” and “Canvas” that make jumping into those features a breeze.</p><h2 id="full-screen-mode-ftw-2">Full-screen mode FTW</h2><p>Want to give Gemini’s text the full spotlight? Just hit the toggle to tuck away the sidebar, and you’re back to a clean, no-frills view. Since the sidebar makes digging up past Gemini chats a breeze, a lot of folks might just keep it open all the time.</p><p>Google is always testing new features and tweaks behind the scenes, so there’s still no set date for when the tablet-ready Gemini layout will drop for everyone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

earbuds I've used.

The best part about open earbuds is that you still get a good sound without the buds having to go inside the ear canal.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BvZLL4MfNDoyodDU2djtpK" name="Acefast AceFit Pro" alt="Acefast AceFit Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvZLL4MfNDoyodDU2djtpK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, there is some sound leakage when you crank up the volume, but for the most part, those in your immediate vicinity won't be able to hear what you're listening to.

A new APK teardown has revealed that users will be able to pick from a variety of voice options even on Google Search (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-voice-search-new-voices-3561504/">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>According to the publication, they noticed that while voice searching on<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight" target="_blank"> AI Mode</a> within the Search beta app, it offered users four different voices to choose from.  Google seems to have given them "space-theme" names, Cosmo, Neso, Terra, and Cassini — each of these voices adds personality and distinction for the user.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yyJnJsttavmGtyciYEgjL" name="Google-Search-app-voice-selection" alt="Google Search could get more voice options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yyJnJsttavmGtyciYEgjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While these voices were initially restricted to AI Mode on Search, it seems like the tech giant plans on expanding them to the generic voice search option on the Google app as well.</p><p>"In our latest APK teardown of the Google app (<em><strong>version 16.20.48.sa.arm64 beta</strong></em>), we have learned that you’ll also hear these same four voices when you perform a voice search through the mic icon," the website explained.</p><p>This can be spotted when using the quick access search features directly from the phone's home screen (if it's a Pixel or using the Google app's widget) or within the Google app itself.</p><p>Users could have a new range of voices for spoken search results, rather than just the single female voice that the app featured for several years. When this feature becomes available, users will be able to personalize their voice search by choosing from the four voice options.</p><p>This selection will be made in the <strong>Google app's settings</strong>,  within the <strong>"Voice"</strong> section, where a "<strong>Choose Voice"</strong> list will appear. While there are only four options for voice in search, it seems like Google is saving a good chunk of these distinct voices for Gemini Live, as you get a list of 10 voices to choose from (Vega, Ursa, Pegasus, Nova, Eclipse, Lyra, Orbit, Dipper, Capella, and Orion).</p><p>During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O</a>, the tech giant discussed a ton of AI features, including opening up AI Mode to everyone in the U.S. It also made<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users"> Gemini Live</a> with camera and screen sharing free and available to everyone on Android and iOS.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the tipster, the feature seems to be inbound for the main Google app. Early code in a recent version has seemingly shown off this new feature, which will bring a new "Images" tab to the bottom options row. When first opening it, it seems Google will encourage users to engage in a little "personalization," and its style is quite familiar.</p><p>The post details a "Save ideas and get inspired" splash page, which will tell users to "pick three or more topics to get started." It's kind of like signing up for social media and being asked to choose what you're interested in, sports, technology, gaming — you get it.</p><p>For Google, it seems it will offer options like "Food & Drink," "Travel," "Nail Art," "DIY & Crafts," and more. From there, the true feed shows up, which, for now, shows large snapshots of images that fit your topics on a "For You" page. Right beneath these photos are their sources, and likely the option to visit where they're from, too.</p><p>Though it's still in the works, the tipster states they spotted evidence of a "save to collection" option.</p><h2 id="google-s-additions-changes-2">Google's Additions & Changes</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="7xcN7XsKtyZPyVLkTf7ry4" name="google-app-pinterest-like-images-topics-page" alt="A rumored photo of the "choose three or more topics" page for Google's potential "Images" tab in its main app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7xcN7XsKtyZPyVLkTf7ry4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="r4TPfBCpbPbDfSwYPWhuy4" name="google-app-pinterest-images-feed-rumor" alt="An example of Google's rumored "Images" tab, which will show a rolling feed of photos based on your interests." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r4TPfBCpbPbDfSwYPWhuy4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="280" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The bulk of Google's recent happenings have involved what's gone on during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">I/O 2025</a>.

One major part of I/O 2025 was Material 3 Expressive, Google's upcoming next-gen design language for Android. The design is meant to be vibrant, packed full of emotion for users.</p><p>The recent leak for the Photos app showed how Google could revamp its main page Memory cards with a more "modern" design. The cards might adopt a heart-shaped cutout over your memories, with the title right above it. The app's code also showcased a "create memory" button, so users can quickly craft one without hopping into the full Memories view.</p><p>Also, considering this new supposed "Images" tab is <em>kind of </em>like a Search function, Google is looking to upgrade AI Mode with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr#:~:text=Shopping%20with%20AI%20Mode">better shopping experience</a>.

We're still expecting the Pixel 10 series to debut with the same batch of phones as the Pixel 9 series did. The rumors lean into that; however, only the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL were mentioned.</p><p>The tipster claims the base Pixel 10 could arrive in four colors: Obsidian, blue, Iris (Purple), and Limoncello (Yellow). This color array is slightly different than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9's</a> Peony (pink), Wintergreen (minty green), Porcelain (white), and Obsidian.</p><p>The remaining colors for the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are as follows:</p><ul><li>Obsidian</li><li>Green</li><li>Sterling (Grey)</li><li>Porcelain (White)</li></ul><h2 id="pixel-10-prep-2">Pixel 10 Prep</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-9-side-by-side-1.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As previously mentioned, a rumor from 2024 suggested Google is interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">keeping four phones</a> in its lineup. The rumor supposedly discovered the codenames for the three slab phones and the next foldable, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Rumors have continued, with the most recent one involving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-spotted-in-commercial-shoot-revealing-its-familiar-design">Pixel 10 Pro at a filming site</a>. It seems Google was caught recording the eventual commercial for the device/series, which gave us a clear look at its design.</p><p>Now, the Pixel 10 series isn't expected to sport any huge design changes, and the leaked "commercial look" kind of doubles down on that. It seems the phone will continue to feature its big camera bar, rounded corners, and flat edges/display.</p><p>Elsewhere, an Android Central exclusive indicates the Pixel 10 could be in for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">unexpected display upgrade</a>. It seems there's a chance for the series to sport a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> rate upgrade that would change the smartphone game for those who are affected. While this doesn't concern a huge portion of users, there's a subset of people who are deeply affected by the PWM dimming rate, often suffering from harsh headaches.</p><p>If Google brings such improvements to the Pixel 10 series, it would alleviate one problematic struggle.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The post alleges this feature will offer assessments to help runners gauge their progress so they can "level up." Supposedly, these "tests" will see whether or not runners are pushing themselves too hard when exercising.</p><p>When it comes to being more "personal," the publication says the Running Coach will provide an initial test for runners. This will involve the feature gathering as much data about you as it can in twelve minutes, while also seeing how far you've run in that same timespan.</p><p>While running, and with the Running Coach (likely) enabled, users will be given "guidance." It's unclear what this guidance could look like; however, it seems the Running Coach will offer tips on how to keep your pace so you're not expending all of your energy so soon.

There was an alleged "early preview" of the software earlier this year, which brought speculation that the Galaxy S25's Now Bar would no longer remain S25 series exclusive. The software's code reportedly stated the feature would appear on "high-end models" like Samsung's past-gen foldables: Flip 6 and Fold 6.</p><p>Moreover, the code suggests Samsung is looking to rework the UI of its Gallery and Files Manager apps.</p><p>Other rumors from early May claimed One UI 8 would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-secure-folder-private-spaces-upgrade-rumored">offer a Secure Folder upgrade</a>, courtesy of Private Space.

Instead, Private Space would create an entirely new section on future Galaxy phones to store sensitive photos, videos, documents, and more.</p><p>Users would also need an entirely new PIN for this Private Space-fueled Secure Folder, enhancing its defenses.</p><p>Just recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-one-ui-8-first-beta-might-be-around-the-corner-for-galaxy-s25-series">One UI 8 beta's existence</a> reportedly showed up in Samsung's members app, potentially signaling its impending rollout. It's leaving users speculating if we're right on the cusp of its arrival, considering the banner's sudden appearance in a few countries. Google is preparing to launch Android 16 in Q2 2025, so it would make sense if Samsung's beta was starting soon.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables and more, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It's built with strong plastic straps that snap snugly on the side of either the Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S, and the adjustment wheel on the back makes it simple to get the right fit in seconds. It fits all the heads in my family quite well (even the kids). Plus, the top strap and back pads are both cushy and easy to remove and clean.</p><p>The real reason I love it, though, is the 10,000mAh rechargeable battery pack that magnetically attaches to the back. This thing will add <em>hours</em> to your playtime, and you can quickly recharge it with any USB-C charger you have lying around.</p><p>If you find yourself lying down while playing VR or sitting in seats with headrests (think airline seats), the BoboVR E3 Pro will be more comfortable but will cost a bit more.

PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds ship with a little USB-C dongle that the buds instantly pair to, giving you a configuration-free way to add wireless earbuds to your Quest setup.</p><p>These have a fraction of the latency of Bluetooth, making them perfect for VR. Bluetooth use isn't advisable in VR because the latency can make some people feel sick. Plus, the USB-C port on the dongle ensures that you can charge your Quest while playing, perfect for pairing with the Yoges headstrap above. The case charges the earbuds, as you would expect, so you won't have to worry about battery life.</p><p>Soundcore also makes a pair of Queset earbuds, but they're built for the slower Quest 2 and won't charge your Quest 3 at its full power, making these irreplaceable. Better yet, since the dongle is USB-C, you can plug it into any device that supports USB-C audio out, like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="79598572-ede0-494e-b7cf-922c063ce921" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="PrismXR Vega T1 made for VR earbuds:" data-dimension48="PrismXR Vega T1 made for VR earbuds:" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1386px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:91.20%;"><img id="FkvyoccXFYjbtCTyuWg4Ug" name="PrismXR-Vega-T1-render-meta-quest-earbuds.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkvyoccXFYjbtCTyuWg4Ug.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1386" height="1264" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW" data-dimension112="79598572-ede0-494e-b7cf-922c063ce921" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="PrismXR Vega T1 made for VR earbuds:" data-dimension48="PrismXR Vega T1 made for VR earbuds:" data-dimension25=""><strong>PrismXR Vega T1 made for VR earbuds:</strong> <del>$69.99</del><strong> $44.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Low latency, made-for-VR earbuds at an ultra-low price!

You get to decide what it does, whether that’s flipping sound modes, launching the camera in a snap, or firing up real-time AI translation.</p><p>But the real star here is OnePlus' AI Plus Mind, a new feature that feels like a supercharged screenshot tool. Instead of dumping everything into your photo gallery like digital clutter, it saves and organizes on-screen information in Mind Space.</p><p>Ever snap a quick picture of a flyer or booking information, only to have it get buried in your photo mess? That’s where AI Plus Mind steps in. Just hit the Plus Key or swipe with three fingers, and it grabs all the key details like dates and spots, so you can actually find it when you need it. Plus, later this year, it’ll start sorting everything for you automatically.</p><p>In the future, AI Plus Mind will go live for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> series and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a> via a software update.

If you're in India, get ready for "AI VoiceScribe," which will record, summarize, and even translate calls and meetings right within your messaging and video apps. However, VoiceScribe is not coming to the EU and North America at this time.</p><p>The OnePlus 13s will also offer "AI Call Assistant" for automatic call summaries or real-time translation during calls.</p><p>For everyone, there's a new "AI Translation" app that brings all translation features (text, voice, camera, screen) into one spot. Plus, "AI Search" is getting an upgrade, letting you use everyday language to search your local files, notes, and calendars, working hand-in-hand with AI Plus Mind for efficient searches.</p><p>Photo buffs will appreciate "AI Reframe," which intelligently analyzes your photos and suggests creative framing options. And if you've ever taken a group photo where someone's blinking, "AI Best Face 2.0" (coming this summer) can fix closed eyes and awkward expressions in group shots with up to 20 people, even if the photo wasn't taken on a OnePlus phone.</p><h2 id="google-gemini-is-joining-the-party-2">Google Gemini is joining the party</h2><p>OnePlus is also playing nice with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>. Soon, Gemini will be integrated across OxygenOS apps like OnePlus Notes and Clock, as well as Google's own apps, for a more seamless AI experience. You'll even be able to use "Gemini Live" with your camera and screen sharing to have real-time conversations about what you're seeing on your phone or through your camera.</p><p>Of course, there's the inevitable privacy conversation. OnePlus claims sensitive data stays on-device or gets processed in its Private Computing Cloud—a supposedly locked-down system even they can't access.</p><p>What stands out here is that OnePlus seems to be focusing on AI features that solve actual problems rather than just checking boxes. The Plus Key and AI Plus Mind in particular feel like thoughtful attempts to make your phone work smarter for you. Now if only OnePlus would stop making the best features region-exclusive.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Joining this is something to help the 6.7-inch display: Corning Gorilla Glass 7i.</p><p>This enhancement lends its strength to better protect the display from scratches and impacts.</p><p>The back of the Moto Edge 2025 sports a stylish soft leather finish, which is where another key bit of information dwells.</p><h2 id="cameras-moto-ai-2">Cameras & Moto AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="ckWSKBkivzPzViAR6cwKNR" name="motorola-edge-2025-camera-array-example" alt="A model holds the new Edge 2025 against their body." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckWSKBkivzPzViAR6cwKNR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Edge features a triple rear camera array with a lead-off 50MP Sony LYTIA 700C primary camera. Motorola calls this its most "capable" camera array yet. With the Sony LYTIA sensor, the post states users can take more "vibrant" and "bright" shots in low-light scenarios. Joining this main sensor is the Edge's 50MP ultrawide with Macro Vision built in.</p><p>Macro Vision enables users to take shots up to 2.5cm away from their target with clarity.

The suite brings its Photo Enhancement Engine to the triple camera array to "reduce noise, accentuate details, and improve dynamic range." Additionally, Moto AI lives right in the Edge 2025's new AI Key.</p><p>Pressing this key will surface features like "Next Move," which can give intelligent suggestions based on what's on your screen.

That was the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a>, a value flagship that has Qualcomm's latest silicon and decent cameras that undercuts the likes of the Galaxy S25 by a significant amount.</p><p>With the Neo 10, iQOO is looking to do the same thing in the mid-range category. The phone marks the debut of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 platform, and it comes with a massive 7,000mAh silicon-carbon battery — made possible by the latest innovations in battery tech — and it has an AMOLED panel that goes up to 144Hz in select use cases.</p><p>Although iQOO introduced the Neo 10 in China at the end of last year, the model that's releasing globally is markedly different; it has a new design, uses Qualcomm's latest silicon, and has a bigger battery. I'm not entirely sure why iQOO didn't use another name with the device, because it doesn't really have any similarities to the Chinese model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="iCoGH4AWdSMyLkBWfkTA6Q" name="iqoo-neo-10-3" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iCoGH4AWdSMyLkBWfkTA6Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The global variant of the Neo 10 is now available in India, which is iQOO's biggest overseas market. The phone is sold in several storage configurations, including 8GB/128GB, 8GB/256GB, 12GB/256GB, 12GB/512GB, and 16GB/512GB. As is the case with most brands, not all storage models will be available in all countries, but iQOO is bringing all four models to India, with the base 8GB/128GB edition debuting at just ₹29,999 ($352).</p><p>The 8GB/256GB variant is listed at ₹31,999 ($375), the 12GB/256GB model is available for ₹33,999 ($399), and the 16GB/512GB edition is ₹38,999 ($457). Coming in at the equivalent of $399 in other Asian markets, the Neo 10 is an clearly aiming to consolidate its position as the go-to gaming phone in the mid-range category. Having used the phone for just under a month, I can unequivocally say that this is one of the best all-round packages available at the moment.</p><h2 id="iqoo-nailed-the-design-brief-2">iQOO nailed the design brief</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="TACt38ZS8qetbw73t8mBKQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-1" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TACt38ZS8qetbw73t8mBKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As always, let's start with the design. The iQOO Neo 10 looks nearly identical to the iQOO 13 thanks to a squarish camera module at the back and similar design aesthetic. The phone has a flat design — like every other device in this category — but there are decent bevels at the edges, and that makes holding and using it much more comfortable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KNZPJ7RwPAhP3AxqoMZyDQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-7" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KNZPJ7RwPAhP3AxqoMZyDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although the design isn't that different to what the brand used in the past, it still looks good in its own right, and if you're getting a vibrant color variant — the phone is available in orange — it will stand out. The phone gets IP65 ingress protection, and that is decent enough in this category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fn9psvzXGgRs3c7kpcQF7Q" name="iqoo-neo-10-6" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fn9psvzXGgRs3c7kpcQF7Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>iQOO retained the same 6.78-inch panel as the Chinese model, and it comes with AMOLED tech, 144Hz refresh, and good brightness levels. I didn't see any problems using the phone outdoors, and iQOO did a good job with color balance out of the box. Like all other Vivo and iQOO phones, you get a decent amount of customizability with regards to adjusting the colors according to your tastes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="z9yg3qSwoPWET8yRXGvXbQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-12" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z9yg3qSwoPWET8yRXGvXbQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The phone is particularly well-suited to gaming; it manages to run select games at 120fps and even 144fps, and there's a clear difference in this area. Onboard sound is quite decent too, and the stereo channels deliver a clean and detailed sound.</p><h2 id="the-neo-10-is-a-beast-of-a-gaming-phone-2">The Neo 10 is a beast of a gaming phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="XpyRAcryp3TDbJFqqvwhSQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-14" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XpyRAcryp3TDbJFqqvwhSQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most mid-range phones now use MediaTek's Dimensity platforms as standard, and it's clear Qualcomm wanted to change that dynamic with the introduction of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. The chipset sees a Cortex X4 in addition to seven A720 cores clocked at 2.0GHz to 3.3GHz, and it comes with an Adreno 825.</p><p>The result is that the Neo 10 is one of the fastest mid-range phones you can buy today; the phone does a fantastic job with gaming, and it handles visually-intensive titles without too much of a hassle. I didn't see any issues with overheating either — which is a downside on devices like the iQOO 13.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>iQOO Neo 10</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 13R</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>1988</p></td><td  ><p>2093</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>6690</p></td><td  ><p>6246</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench AI (Quantized Score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2900</p></td><td  ><p>3041</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3566</p></td><td  ><p>4550</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>21.35</p></td><td  ><p>27.25</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Solar Bay (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5131</p></td><td  ><p>8075</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Solar Bay (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>19.51</p></td><td  ><p>30.71</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In short, if you want a mid-range gaming phone, the Neo 10 is a great choice. The phone does a good job with connectivity as well, and while the vibration motor isn't quite as detailed as high-end phones, it is decent enough.</p><p>Battery life is an area where the Neo 10 has a considerable advantage over its rivals; thanks to a 7,000mAh silicon-carbon battery, the phone consistently manages to last two days between charges. Even with heavy use, I was able to get well over a day and a half worth of use before having to plug in the device.</p><p>In general, battery anxiety is a thing of the past — unless you're using the Galaxy S25 Edge — and the Neo 10 proves that we are at a point where you don't need to charge your phone every single day. There's plenty to like on the charging front too, with the phone using Vivo's 120W tech; it takes just over 44 minutes to charge the device, and that's less than most flagships.</p><p>iQOO bundles a charger in the box, and it doubles as a 100W PD charger, so you can use it with any other device. As good as the Neo 10 is at gaming, it is the battery life where the phone truly comes into its own.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="a2MNXqyHm5gqBdvHsDKdhP" name="iqoo-neo-10-13" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a2MNXqyHm5gqBdvHsDKdhP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4851" height="2732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The phone has a 50MP Sony IMX882 as the main lens, and it is joined by an 8MP GalaxyCore GC08 wide-angle camera, and a 32MP GalaxyCore GC32E selfie lens. The selfie lens is notable as it gets autofocus, and it's clear iQOO wanted to prioritize this over the auxiliary cameras at the back.</p><p>That's because the 8MP wide-angle lens is strictly average; it does a passable job in daylight situations, but it just doesn't measure up in low-light shooting conditions. You don't get a tele lens either, and that puts the Neo on the backfoot. That said, the main camera is terrific, and it delivers vibrant photos in just about any lighting scenario.</p><p>There isn't much to talk about on the software side of things; the Neo 10 comes with Funtouch OS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and the interface is identical to what you get on other Vivo and iQOO phones. I like the design, the UI itself is fluid, and you get extensive customizability.</p><h2 id="you-re-getting-a-phenomenal-value-2">You're getting a phenomenal value</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="VeSyqZpW686PpRx2zTznVQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-11" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VeSyqZpW686PpRx2zTznVQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like every other brand, iQOO is dabbling in AI-assisted utilities, but it isn't going quite as overboard when it comes to pushing these services constantly — unlike Samsung. The phone will get four Android OS updates, and again, that is in line with other devices in this category.</p><p>With the Neo 10, iQOO is showing that it knows how to deliver an all-rounder that excels at gaming and battery life. Outside of the average auxiliary camera, I don't really have any negatives to point out, and that alone shows just how good this phone is — iQOO ticked all the right boxes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While it didn’t happen, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/an-open-letter-to-the-fairphone-community/118760">released a blog post</a> apologizing to its consumers, explaining the current scenario and the reasons for the delay.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="2yL9UrsD7riKRTNDkBaMNE" name="fairphone-4.jpg" alt="Fairphone 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2yL9UrsD7riKRTNDkBaMNE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="545" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>“We know this one has been especially frustrating, and we’re sorry for the long wait times many of you have faced.

It starts with Fairphone 4, as the firm assures that it hasn’t abandoned it. With the Android 14 update significantly delayed, the company now wants to shift its focus directly onto the next iteration, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>.</p><p>“After thoroughly evaluating what it would take to deliver a stable Android 14 update, we’ve made the difficult decision to shift our focus directly to Android 15.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="R3Mk6dJu8qh9PLboKDFfiF" name="Android-15-through-pixel-9-case" alt="Looking through a Pixel 9 Pro XL Thinborne case at an Android 15 logo on a Pixel 8 Pro's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R3Mk6dJu8qh9PLboKDFfiF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fairphone notes that it is “actively working on bringing Android 15” to the Fairphone 4 and will be keeping its users posted on a regular basis. While it is a notable step in the right direction, the company isn’t giving users a fixed timeline on when to expect the Android 15 update on the handset as certain things aren’t yet under its control. For now, true Fairphone enthusiasts should keep their hopes intact as they can expect the company is now dedicated to bringing in the next iteration update as early as possible.</p><p>Till then, users are further recommended to get on the forum for all the latest developments from the company, as the team promises to be more present, and users can expect prompt responses and updates.</p><p>“Even if it’s just a small check-in or an update that says “still working on it,” we’ll share it. We get it now: silence doesn’t help. We can do better. So that’s what we’re committing to.”</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-launch">Fairphone 5</a>, on the other hand, released with Android 13 back in 2023 and was promised at least five OS updates and a whopping eight years of software and security updates.

This premium wearable boasts a rugged design with incredible battery life and all of the latest health tracking and software features, courtesy of Samsung. </p><p>This particular discount is only available on the LTE Titanium Grey and orange version of the watch, but you can score similar price cuts by exploring other configurations. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartwatch-Wellness-Tracking-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YL96ND" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="98561b74-d78d-4fd6-9853-e1bf20b6fc82" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$649.99" data-dimension48="$649.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>As described in our 4/5-star review, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is pretty much peak Android technology, coming complete with a comprehensive suite of accurate health and fitness tracking features, a powerful Exynos W1000 CPU, and a hefty boost to battery life. The watch also boasts military-grade durability with IP68 and 5ATM water resistance, but the focus on ruggedness hasn't stopped Samsung from equipping the watch with a vibrant 1.5-inch Super AMOLED display. </p><p>That being said, the Galaxy Watch Ultra's bulky design isn't for everyone (nor is that orange color, just saying), so if you want something a bit more sleek, you might want to check out the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a>. That top-rated wearable is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88"><strong>currently seeing its own 27% discount</strong>,</a> which is nothing to scoff at.</p><p>No matter which smartwatch deal you choose, you're getting powerful wearable technology that you can count on, whether you're on the trail or in the office. But I'd advise you not to wait too long: these deals could expire at any moment. </p> ]]></dc:content>

In December, Gemini hit the Public Preview for a test regarding Nest devices. Those in the Public Preview with a Nest Audio or Nest Mini (2nd gen) speaker could call on Gemini for Ai-powered answers.

The publication has reportedly stumbled across the Korean OEM's (early) support webpage for the next budget earbuds. This page isn't live everywhere, as the post notes its existence in Turkey, the UAE, Russia, and India.</p><p>It's not too exciting yet. The page is extremely barebones, only displaying the Galaxy Buds Core's supposed model number: SM-R410. We've seen this name appear before in older rumors, so perhaps this report bears weight.</p><p>Additionally, X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/1926048056761335983">TheGalox </a>posted a leak that doubles down on a previous aspect: the device's battery (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_buds_core_battery_capacity_leaks-news-67952.php">GSMArena</a>). The rumor claims the device could see a 100mAh capacity battery in each earbud and a 500mAh charging case.</p><h2 id="a-core-change-2">A "Core" Change</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Buds Core batteries have leaked• Case: 500mah battery • Buds: 100mah battery (each)Buds have 34mah larger batteries and 21mah larger case battery than the Buds FE pic.twitter.com/y0Bo4UogMe<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1926048056761335983">May 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The idea of a "Galaxy Buds Core" first popped up around mid-March <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-core-fe-name-change-battery-leaks">after the device reportedly appeared</a> in an overseas database. The listing suggests Samsung had given the buds the following model number: SM-R410. What's more, the device's charging case was also supposedly found, furthering this rumor. Considering we've seen this for the second time, per that X rumor, these numbers might be something to keep in mind.</p><p>For the buds, this rumor (roughly) equates to a 34mAh difference, while the case could see a small 21mAh increase.</p><p>Unfortunately, we're still left in the dark about any potential design changes. Remember: Samsung radically changed its Galaxy Buds design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">with the Buds 3 Pro</a>, shifting it to closer compete with Apple's AirPods. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">Samsung's execs were furious at the design changes</a>, it remains to be seen which way the company will go. Either we'll see a continuation of it, simply because the FE line typically leans on the flagship, or we'll see the old wing-tip return.</p><p>If anything, most speculate we could see these "Buds Core" appear during Samsung's summer Unpacked event.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Earbuds deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-3942488373306676811&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fheadphone-and-speaker-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-1439230817215273679&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Felectronics%2Fshop-headphones-by-type%2F3944_133251_1095191_1230614%3Fsort%3Dbest_match%26cat_id%3D3944_133251_1095191_1230614_1230476%26stores%3D3081%26ps%3D40" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dearbuds%26crid%3D2RWE1G9N1EIF%26sprefix%3Dearbuds%252Caps%252C161%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3684533289615312016-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-4627605166576297954&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Faudio%2Fall-audio%2F&article_name=%27Galaxy%20Buds%20Core%27%20tipped%20to%20replace%20the%20Buds%20FE%20in%20more%20ways%20than%20just%20name&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Faccessories%2Fearbuds%2Fgalaxy-buds-core-fe-name-change-battery-leaks" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-17070419?sid=ac-us-1342760424953114264&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/earbuds" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

I mean, the Galaxy S25 family consists of four different devices, each offering something a little different from the rest.

For the most part, that's the case, but it's what you'll find under the hood that matters most.</p><p>For one, it's powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> and features 12GB of RAM. Not only does this make the S25 Plus one of the most powerful phone to date, but it also brings with it an abundance of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features.</p><p>Not only that, but Samsung continues to work wonders with One UI, and the latest iteration is no exception. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">review</a>, Android Central Managing Editor Derrek Lee said that it "feels like a Pixel phone in all the best ways. Not only is it chock-full of AI, but the software finally feels fluid and cohesive."</p><p>But what about the hardware? Getting the obvious out of the way, Samsung didn't skimp out on the build quality, so you know that the S25 Plus will last for years to come. It's a pretty sleek phone that doesn't venture outside of its comfort zone, in more ways than one.</p><p>If there was anything to argue against the S25 Plus, it's that there aren't many hardware upgrades besides the processor. This means that you have the same camera array on the back and the same battery as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-galaxy-s24-plus">predecessor</a>. Recycling designs is one thing, but when you consider the price tag, recycling the internals just doesn't feel great.</p><p>On the flip side of that, it's not like the cameras aren't still very capable. They just won't be able to match up with other flagships out there like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/this-is-not-a-test-the-pixel-9-pro-xl-has-returned-to-its-lowest-price-ever-during-amazons-memorial-day-sale">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, or iPhone 16 Pro. But if a picture doesn't come out looking the way you hoped, just lean on Galaxy AI or Google Photos, and we'd be willing to be that you'll end up with exactly what you're looking for.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="003aacc6-8cb4-4a74-9b32-494007260b63">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWsYJeA9FLGbXsBt6BFQ8T.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus in Silver Shadow official render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><strong>Not too big, not too small, but </strong><em><strong>just</strong></em><strong> right</strong></p><p>Thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, the Galaxy S25 Plus makes for a compelling option if you don't need the "Ultra" features.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Carrier deals: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><u><strong>T-Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

They work for almost everyone, and if they don't work for you right out of the box, there are loads of accessibility features and hardware accessories that can make them just right. If smart glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">the Android XR ones I tried at Google I/O 2025</a> are a future smartphone replacement, that's a problem.</p><p>Something you wear on your face needs to be much more personal to you than a phone you stash away in your pocket or bag. Smart glasses need to match your personal style while also feeling comfortable, accommodating the various face and head shapes out there.</p><p>For prescription glasses-wearers, there are more considerations. You need to be able to fit a wide variety of prescription lenses inside smart frames at a reasonable cost.</p><p>So far, there isn't a single <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">pair of smart glasses</a> or even one VR/XR headset that fits the bill.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jLhj4f6aBKDJry7HKGwgh8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-2" alt="Android XR prototype glasses in front of a Pixel smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jLhj4f6aBKDJry7HKGwgh8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta seems to have gotten closest with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, offering the technology in a handful of Ray-Ban styles. They're available in classic Wayfarer frames or a chic Skyler look, plus a few others. However, Meta failed to make the smart glasses accessible for low-vision users. The prescription lens range for Ray-Ban Meta is merely -6.00 to +4.00 total power, which leaves a lot of people out.</p><p>Last year, I wrote that while I loved the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">I'd never wear them again</a>. It wasn't because they weren't useful or too pricey — it was because my new eyewear prescription now falls outside Meta's extremely limited range.</p><p>Smaller brands seemed to have solved this problem already. Solos' AirGo 3 smart glasses support an enormous prescription strength range of -15.00 to +10.00 when using thin lenses. There's no excuse for Meta offering such limited support for prescription lenses when other companies, like Solos, have figured it out.</p><p>This is an accessibility problem, plain and simple — not everyone can or wants to wear contacts, and glasses-wearers deserve to experience smart glasses and Android XR, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3855px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="jPptAU9k7iUELPP78XuQo8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-1" alt="Android XR prototype glasses in front of a Pixel smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jPptAU9k7iUELPP78XuQo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3855" height="2169" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm hopeful that Google's approach to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> glasses is the one to solve this accessibility issue once and for all. It's not trying to make smart glasses all by itself, nor is it restricting the company to a single eyewear partner. While Meta chose to work with EssilorLuxottica — a legacy eyewear and optical brand managing popular names like Ray-Ban, Oakley, and LensCrafters — Google picked <em>two</em> new-age partners in Warby Parker and Gentle Monster.</p><p>Both brands are relatively new in the eyewear space, at least by comparison to EssilorLuxottica, but they've been abundantly successful. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-glasses-coming-designed-by-gentle-monster-warby-parker">Warby Parker and Gentle Monster</a> are extremely popular among younger audiences and feature new, hip styles.</p><p>I have no doubt that Google's upcoming Android XR glasses will be better-looking than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">R</a>ay-Ban Metas, because the latter restrict Meta's development to the older style of Wayfarer frames. Meanwhile, Google has the <em>potential</em> to make smart glasses technology that is frame-agnostic. In other words, it can design smart hardware that can fit into a variety of frames and styles, so there's something for everyone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fLhUdnX3ScDaV7rvFNn6W3" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-vs-google-smart-glasses-sameer-teaser" alt="Android president Sameer Samat wearing Google's upcoming smart glasses with a picture of Android Central's Nick Sutrich wearing Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fLhUdnX3ScDaV7rvFNn6W3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Android president Sameer Samat wearing Google's upcoming smart glasses beside a picture of Android Central's Nick Sutrich wearing Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screen captures from The Android Show I/O Edition 2025)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I emphasize the word <em>potential</em> because there's no guarantee that Google doesn't just follow in Meta's footsteps.

Beyerdynamic thinks it has the goods to do so in the Aventho 300, its top-of-the-line wireless headphones built to take on the best in the business.</p><p>The company’s heritage in studio-quality headphones and headsets, dating back a century, is part of what sets the tone here, though the playing field is tough to win in today. That’s all the more evident when considering what sets this pair apart from the likes of Sony and Bose.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-beyerdynamic-aventho-300-price-and-availability"><span>Beyerdynamic Aventho 300: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7GfXG4Fwps6wLmRZbdxWX" name="Beyerdynamic-Aventho-300-case" alt="Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 headphones inside carrying case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7GfXG4Fwps6wLmRZbdxWX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyerdynamics launched the Aventho 300 in September 2024 and you can find them at a number of retailers in stores or online. They cost $400, though may see a price drop in time as they continue to stay available in the market. They come in black or Nordic grey.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-beyerdynamic-aventho-300-what-s-good"><span>Beyerdynamic Aventho 300: What's good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oxgGYyriSZ3hzmtJF332S" name="Beyerdynamic-Aventho-300-wearing" alt="Wearing Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 headphones view from left side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oxgGYyriSZ3hzmtJF332S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Aventho 300 represent a newer design philosophy for Beyerdynamic given they don’t look like any pair the company has made before. That’s not to say there’s anything too dramatic going on from the outside. They are, for all intents and purposes, a pretty standard-looking set of cans. The more critical element comes in how the design complements how comfortable they need to be.</p><p>Soft cushioning on both ear cups and the headband helps the headphones contour to your head and cover your ears, providing very good passive isolation before you even do anything with them. The combination of metal and plastic gives them a luxurious feel, amplified further by the fact that there’s <em>both</em> a soft pouch and sturdy carrying case in the box.</p><p>The challenge is that Beyerdynamic’s engineers might have done better by just making the ear cups slightly wider to accommodate a broader set of ears. As is, you are more likely to find them a nice fit or one that tends to wear on you after a while. It’s so subjective, and that’s why it’s hard for me to qualify it for you either way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V4QUA2gcdyeA8D4UZt2dP" name="Beyerdynamic-Aventho-300-buttons" alt="Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 laying down showing buttons and ports." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4QUA2gcdyeA8D4UZt2dP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The physical controls and ports are all on the right cup, and they’re easier to manage when you learn the two main buttons: power and ANC/AMB to control active noise cancelation and Transparency mode. I got used to them after a while, to make it really simple to cycle between the two modes. This way, I could listen to something with ANC on, quickly switching to ambient when I needed to hear an announcement or someone talking.</p><p>There are wear sensors on board to automatically pause playback when taking them off, resuming again when putting them back on. This can extend to phone calls, where taking them off hangs up the call.</p><p>The rest of the control scheme is made up of touch-based gestures on either side. A simple tap will play/pause or accept/end a call. Swipe forward to skip a track or back to go to the previous one. Swipe up or down to control volume. They’re all pretty responsive, and Beyerdynamic does a nice job avoiding false positives, including when you put the headphones on or take them off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="EoeSD5SZNvkf9M9xYVFED" name="Beyerdynamic-Aventho-300-screenshots-1" alt="Screenshots from Beyerdynamic app for Aventho 300 headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EoeSD5SZNvkf9M9xYVFED.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like pretty much any pair of headphones these days, the dedicated app is a must to get the most out of the Aventho 300. It’s not only where you learn about the various features but also where you update the firmware and take what’s available to personalize your experience. You can’t remap the controls, leaving you the EQ, ANC, and Transparency settings as a means to customize what you want.</p><p>Both ANC and Transparency are adaptive, letting you choose between levels 1-5 to determine the potency of the effect. It’s the same layout for Transparency. That’s great for setting each effect to what you want but adjusting either one on the fly requires going through the app, which isn’t always convenient.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="UjgFMWAzPeEFHURDLnLcJo" name="Beyerdynamic-Aventho-300-screenshots-2" alt="Screenshots from Beyerdynamic app for Aventho 300 headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UjgFMWAzPeEFHURDLnLcJo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These two features also tie into the overall sound, and that’s where the Aventho 300 make for an interesting — and vexing — listen. They support the SBC, AAC, and aptX Adaptive (including Lossless) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth codecs</a>, giving Android devices an inherent advantage when listening to audio from sources offering higher quality. Even when you aren’t getting that (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/years-later-spotify-still-says-its-working-on-super-premium-with-lossless-audio">looking at you, Spotify</a>), you should come away impressed at the balance your ears get.</p><p>While definitely thick on the bass, sound quality doesn’t come at the expense of the mids and highs. In fact, the highs might actually be <em>too</em> high, as my ears detected hints of sibilance, especially with rock or smooth jazz tracks where string and brass instruments tend to be prominent.</p><p>It’s not common that a pair of over-ear headphones could impress both bass lovers and self-respecting audiophiles, but I do believe both types would like what they hear. Listening to multiple genres, it’s clear to me there’s a broad range in the output they deliver.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vs57k6ctoAMRQ6K2B4hD6C" name="Beyerdynamic-Aventho-300-earcups" alt="Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 headphones laying flat with ear cups up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vs57k6ctoAMRQ6K2B4hD6C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is all based on the standard sound profile already set up in the EQ. You have the option to go with one of five other presets (neutral, bass, smooth, loudness, speech) or create your own using the 5-band equalizer. It’s also the best way to try and dial back any of the excesses your ears might perceive, or even enhance those you think go too far.</p><p>Dolby Atmos support with head tracking is nice to have, especially when listening to tracks offering it, but it’s not mind-blowing. I had mixed reactions with it, where some songs resonated more while others felt hollowed out by the effect. You may find leaving it off is better in most cases.</p><div><blockquote><p>Expect 50-60 hours per charge if you’re not blasting them above 70% volume.</p></blockquote></div><p>There’s a cable in the box for wired playback as well. Indeed, I actually got some of the best audio quality by using it to connect an external DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and getting that sonic boost no matter what I was listening to. It’s one way to truly get the most out of the excellent drivers Beyerdynamic equips in these headphones.</p><p>With multipoint support, you can also connect them (wirelessly) with two devices at the same time. Work on a laptop, listening to tunes from your phone, and take a call on either device when ready. Call quality is also solid, courtesy of the six microphones doing a good job isolating your voice, though you’ll find results are better the quieter it is around you.</p><p>Then there’s battery life, which is just outstanding. Expect 50-60 hours per charge if you’re not blasting them above 70% volume. Those numbers simply crush Sony and Bose, who could barely muster half that, so this is a big win for Beyerdynamic in that regard.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-beyerdynamic-aventho-300-what-s-not-good"><span>Beyerdynamic Aventho 300: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ztp9oWp6PU962euY8bFGP" name="Beyerdynamic-Aventho-300-close-up" alt="Close-up view of Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ztp9oWp6PU962euY8bFGP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1700" height="956" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The thing about going up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> in this category is that you have to do more than a few things really well. That’s simply not the case with how the Aventho 300 handle noise cancellation. It’s not on par with what Sony and Bose deliver, mainly because you have to give something up to get the effect’s full power.</p><p>They do well enough to hold back ambient noises. Walking down a busy street, I didn’t hear much around me while listening to a podcast, though sounds still pierced through in ways I wouldn’t expect from $400 cans.</p><p>Moreover, switching to music makes the disparity clearer because the tuning changes by boosting the bass and muffling some of the mids. It just feels unnecessary, and while I can understand that ANC affects sound on any pair of headphones, my ears tell me premium pairs get that combination right more often than what’s happening here.</p><div><blockquote><p>Longer periods had me scratching ear itches in ways other pairs haven’t caused.</p></blockquote></div><p>Even when you leave ANC off, the sound just feels like it could hit another level but falls a bit short. As much as these may appeal to a wider range of users, $400 headphones should sound exceptional, and it’s hard to get there with these unless you tweak them first.</p><p>Then there’s the comfort side of things. Longer periods had me scratching ear itches in ways other pairs haven’t caused. My skin wasn’t reacting to the Aventho 300 with redness or anything like that, just that I’d inevitably have to occasionally take them off just to get comfortable again.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-beyerdynamic-aventho-300-competition"><span>Beyerdynamic Aventho 300: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RVxMcLn6JEtSsXVEtzayMM" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-headphones-buttons.jpg" alt="Close-up view of buttons on Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RVxMcLn6JEtSsXVEtzayMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It’s interesting because I find the Aventho 300 can sound as good as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review" target="_blank">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a> and offer better bass than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sennheiser-momentum-4-wireless" target="_blank">Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless</a>, but aren’t quite as crisp on the highs.

If you come across them at a discount, however, give them a try and you may get better value for what you’re spending.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_standard" data-id="30ad733b-9b5a-4cf2-90c1-4d2f7e61058f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tj9kQDUW5JnPayMCnNAuL5.jpg' alt="Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 in black on white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Beyerdynamic Aventho 300</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Dynamic sound</strong></em></p><p>The Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 don't skimp out on the balanced sound or volume, though too many sounds squeak past the active noise cancelation.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

That's the same discount that the premium foldable received during the Black Friday sales last fall!</p><p>We loved the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold upon its release, especially because of its vivid, good-looking, 8-inch AMOLED display, its range of cameras, and its impressive battery life. The only major problem we had with the phone was its price, but thanks to this Memorial Day discount, purchasing the 9 Pro Fold is a much easier pill to swallow.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-memorial-day-sale-2025-best-android-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon just launched its Memorial Day sale early — I found the 20 deals that no Android user should miss</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d0ff02ed-af99-4efb-beee-346e601c3609" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold 256GB:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold 256GB:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Fold-Smartphone/dp/B0D7V1J2Y1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="TrgeFJLvxpukjMZC4BfCYe" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-official-render-obsidian-folded.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TrgeFJLvxpukjMZC4BfCYe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold 256GB:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Fold-Smartphone/dp/B0D7V1J2Y1" target="_blank" data-dimension112="d0ff02ed-af99-4efb-beee-346e601c3609" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold 256GB:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold 256GB:" data-dimension25=""> <del>$1,799</del> <strong>$1,499 at Amazon for Memorial Day</strong></a></p><p>Those who don't mind going with an expensive phone will appreciate this deal for $300 off the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, a great foldable phone that true Android enthusiasts will love.

Nevertheless, users love the Fold's 8-inch AMOLED Super Actua Flex display, its impressively long battery life, and the wide range of Pixel features.</p><p>With such a large screen, this Pixel's inclusion of split-screen multitasking was also a major plus, though we would have liked to see it released with support for a stylus. Nonetheless, it also sports a pretty great suite of cameras, Gemini Advanced AI features with a Google One Premium plan, and it's the thinnest foldable phone out there, much to the delight of those who like a lightweight device. It's worth noting that support for wireless charging stands is hit or miss with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and that it's still pretty expensive, even with $300 off.</p><p>Still, if you're a Pixel fan who's been waiting for the right opportunity to try a foldable, this could be the deal for you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's too bad that Garmin Trails has so much room to grow <em>and</em> pushes people toward Connect+.</p><p>Garmin Trails is the company's answer to AllTrails and Komoot. Any Connect user can search through local trails under <strong>More > Training & Planning > Garmin Trails</strong>, filtering routes by distance, total ascent, difficulty, popular months, and "features" like being dog-friendly.</p><p>You only need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect Plus subscription</a> to save the trail to your courses or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>. Similar trails remain available in the Garmin Courses section, which requires no subscription to export them. Garmin had to balance not removing old features and incentivizing Connect Plus, so it made Trails instead of improving Courses.</p><p>Some early reactions to Garmin Trails have been negative, either because it's currently limited to five countries or because it "shouldn't" be paywalled as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/forerunner-570-and-970-have-made-garmin-tiered-strategy-clearer-than-ever">Garmin watches get more expensive</a>. Judging Trails solely on its merits as a U.S.-based user, along with the new rucking tools, I'm generally positive on the feature, but have several reservations.</p><h2 id="garmin-trails-needs-your-help-to-work-2">Garmin Trails needs your help to work</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tPczw52h9xGZWdjRbgcyUB" name="Garmin-Connect-Trails-review" alt="The Garmin Connect app showing Garmin Trails filters for finding a hiking spot, including distance, elevation gain, rating, difficulty, and type of trail." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPczw52h9xGZWdjRbgcyUB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most popular hiking apps require a subscription to sync community routes to your Garmin watch for offline navigation. No doubt Garmin hopes that offering a first-party alternative directly in Connect will make people cut out the middlemen (middleapps?) like Komoot and AllTrails.</p><p>First, the positives: Garmin Trails has robust filters. I can hover over the wider California Bay Area, say I want a hike with 2,000–4,000 feet of total ascent that's no more than 15 miles, reaches any peak, and is dog friendly, and see all 49 hikes that fit that criteria within driving distance.</p><p>In my specific county, I can find 17 easy, 55 moderate, and 49 hard hikes within reasonable driving distance, then narrow down the list with either Loop, Out & Back, or Point to Point filters. It's all useful context, and if you're a casual hiker like me who might try one new route a month, that could last you for years.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GzjHn8qL6QBYRnjV2ePpS9" name="garmin-connect-garmin-trails-screenshots" alt="Screenshots of Garmin Connect showing the data for a Garmin Trails hike (left) and the options to review a Garmin Trails hike (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzjHn8qL6QBYRnjV2ePpS9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, most of the "Features" and ratings aren't useful yet because they require user input. Garmin made sure to mark 250 dog-friendly Bay Area trails, but (hilariously) can't find a single one that's "Kid Friendly" or has "Forest" or "Flowers" to look at.</p><p>I spot-checked a dozen trails, and each had a one-paragraph summary that tended to be fairly generic, listing out the length, time to finish, what views you'll see, and whether it's dog friendly. Seriously, someone at Garmin loves dogs. You won't get much other context.</p><p>This should improve with time as users fill in the blanks with reviews, and I like that hikers can tag specific Conditions like Temporary Closure, Trail Damage, Bugs, Crowded, and so on.</p><p>But Garmin has to play catch-up against AllTrails, Komoot, and other community-driven apps with years of context and photos, with an entire app dedicated to hiking rather than a single section of Connect. Garmin users will have to help prop Trails up as a service.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="boN3P7Pb2R57EY4W677VyB" name="Garmin-Connect-Trails-vs-AllTrails" alt="Two side-by-side phones showing Garmin Connect Trails (left) and AllTrails (right), with Garmin showing 103 hikes in the California East Bay while AllTrails shows 500 hikes in a slightly smaller area." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/boN3P7Pb2R57EY4W677VyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Garmin Trails (<em>left</em>) has 103 trails in this stretch of California; AllTrails (<em>right</em>) has at least 500 trails in a slightly smaller range. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin's Trails list misses out on a <strong>huge</strong> number of trails found on other platforms. I checked around Mount Diablo, a local favorite, but saw no trails at the popular Artist's Point parking lot where people typically start heading to the peak. All the hikes start along the park edge, meaning they're intimidatingly difficult and almost twice as long.</p><p>More generally, Garmin Trails shows about 500 hikes in a huge portion of Northern California from Santa Rosa and Sacramento down past the Bay into Monterey; I can find over 500 trails in Contra Costa County alone on AllTrails.</p><p>Theoretically, Garmin's selection is supposed to be curated, so casual hikers can skip to the best options. But I think it's more accurate to say that Garmin finds most of the best <em>starting points</em> but defaults to one great hike option when AllTrails might show five or more variations from that same point.</p><p>You can "Customize Trail" to download it to Garmin Courses and try to shape it to your needs first, but I found it almost impossible to edit a course to be shorter, so at that point, you might as well make it from scratch and bypass Trails altogether.</p><h2 id="rucking-and-pack-weight-2">Rucking and pack weight</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="j5GejJwFTTxAnnHbH3J6RB" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-rucking-set-weight" alt="Adding a "Set Weight" to a Rucking activity on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j5GejJwFTTxAnnHbH3J6RB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-adds-rucking-mode-but-i-already-want-more">excited to test rucking on Garmin watches</a> for months, ever since I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone">jumped into the rucking fad last year</a>. For those unaware, rucking takes the military training concept of carrying extra pack weight for training and applies it to everyday athletes, helping them build muscle and endurance on hikes that might normally be easy with a light pack.</p><p>With the update downloaded on my Fenix 8, I installed a 4-mile route from Garmin Trails, loaded up my pack with 25 pounds — tough for me, easy for most rucking enthusiasts — and drove to the trailhead.</p><p>I had two choices: Either do an actual Rucking sport activity or choose Hiking and add my pack weight. In either case, carrying more than a few pounds prevents the activity from affecting your VO2 Max, and the Rucking profile seemed more likely to have specialized widgets, so I went with that option.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XNAzeJtPp72A6qfUMGtsPB" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-rucking-activity" alt="On the Garmin Fenix 8, a Rucking activity showing a specific course and Pack Weight with GPS connected." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XNAzeJtPp72A6qfUMGtsPB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The default Rucking data screens show HR, distance, elevation, ascent and descent, hill grade, sunrise/ sunset times, a compass, and your map. And the post-workout screen shows the usual data like calorie burn and training load — only with your logged pack weight taken into account.</p><p>That's all useful data, but it's basically what you'd see on a Hike activity. Eventually, I'd want Garmin to display load-adjusted pace, stamina depletion, estimated muscle strain build-up, or other metrics <em>specific</em> to the amount of weight you're carrying.</p><p>I've previously written about how cool it'd be to have some kind of Load Score, like Hill or Endurance Score, that takes your logged pack weight into account to judge how much weight you can safely carry and adjusts the score over time with new data.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BucfwLA7D2rQfc4NwEcMtB" name="Garmin-Connect-Trails-map-navigation-2" alt="A Garmin Fenix 8 showing a course map saying to make a turn in front of a metal fence surrounded by barbed wire." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BucfwLA7D2rQfc4NwEcMtB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">"Just hop the fence with your rucksack," says Garmin Trails. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RGncjzxGxHL6dyGamKT22C" name="Garmin-Connect-Trails-map-navigation-3" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 showing a course map with the location "off trail" by 0.2 miles in front of a gate, with a pair of trekking poles leaning against the gate." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGncjzxGxHL6dyGamKT22C.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">I'm 0.2 miles off-trail when I find the gate. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Returning to Garmin Trails, my on-watch route was quite useful in ensuring I stayed on trail, with occasional audio alerts before turns and a warning once I missed a turn and started to stray off course.</p><p>But I do have to roast Garmin's recommended trail a bit. In the photo above, you can see how Garmin told me to climb over this immovable fence surrounded by barbed wire to stay on course. I had to go "off course" 0.2 miles to get to the actual turnaround point (which I knew from a previous hike).</p><p>Garmin does have a "Report an issue" field, so I told Garmin that it needed to update its map. I'll be curious to see if Garmin changes its official Trail route, and how quickly.</p><h2 id="breathing-variation-2">Breathing variation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HoZXxHk7XDyrpTkVfsgDPQ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-breathing-variations" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 showing the Breathing Variations data screen in the Sleep Score data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HoZXxHk7XDyrpTkVfsgDPQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A lot of smartwatch brands are pushing towards sleep apnea detection, and Garmin's new breathing variation tool steps in that direction.</p><p>Garmin watches have always been the best option for blood oxygen data because you can choose between spot checks, all-night data, or all-day data in the Settings, and they have the battery life to support it. Plus, you had in-depth HRV data to judge your physiological recovery and stress levels.</p><p>Now you get one more metric with breathing variations. Garmin attributes them to "lifestyle factors, your sleep environment, or other issues," without specifically mentioning that sleep apnea might cause occasional or frequent issues.</p><p>I wore my Fenix 8 to bed and saw moments when I had a "Few" breathing variations, with the Sleep Score showing my SpO2 levels and breath rate per minute (brpm), both average and lowest.</p><p>As Garmin warns, it's "not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease," but over time, you can see whether the signs suggest you should get sleep labs done for a potential issue. I'm glad that Garmin's offering it and that it's available on most recent Garmin watches.</p><h2 id="judging-the-may-garmin-update-2">Judging the May Garmin update</h2><p>I didn't need to retest the Passcode feature to say that it's an important one for optional security that other brands already test. And I'm sure golfers with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> will appreciate getting new tools like full-color CourseView maps, touch targeting, PlaysLike distance and Green Contours.</p><p>I'm generally a fan of this update! It's a relief that my pack weight won't skew my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a> results anymore, and I'm happy to wait for the rucking profile to get more specialized tools in a future update, hopefully.</p><p>But for Garmin Trails, Garmin wearers need to start adding in the missing data to catch up with AllTrails and Komoot. The Connect+ hurdle may turn away some users who might otherwise have embraced it, which could slow this down.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you’re into hiking trails, crushing workouts, or just keeping an eye on your health, there are a bunch of new features here for everyone.</p><p>This update is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/outdoor/garmin-announces-several-feature-updates-on-select-smartwatches/" target="_blank">loaded with upgrades</a> from smarter health tracking and beefed-up security to nifty tools for finding your way outdoors, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/i-put-garmins-connect-trails-breathing-variations-and-rucking-sport-to-the-test">we've already tested some of them</a>. Highlights include sleep breathing insights, a new rucking mode for weighted treks, a fine-tuned stage timer for shooting sports, and some upgrades for golf and trail features.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone">Rucking</a> isn’t just a workout; it’s a lifestyle for a lot of adventurers. But until now, Garmin watches didn’t really get it. They’d log it like a normal hike, which messed with stats like VO2 max since moving slower with extra weight looked like you were out of shape. With the new pack weight option, your watch finally understands the grind.</p><p>Just toss in your pack’s weight, and your watch dials in your stats so things like VO2 max and calories burned actually reflect the real effort you’re putting in.</p><p>The new rucking feature is now live on both Instinct 3 models (standard and Tactical), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> lineup, Enduro 3, Forerunner 570, and Forerunner 970.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yd4SFRpcYEoCfQHnrU3h5X" name="IMG_9784" alt="A post-run heart rate graph showing the runner's average and max heart rate across a two-mile track workout, with most heart rates in zone 4 (orange) or zone 5 (red)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yd4SFRpcYEoCfQHnrU3h5X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="ruck-mode-unlocked-2">Ruck mode unlocked</h2><p>At the same time, this update also brings breathing variation tracking to a bunch of watches, including the Vivoactive, Venu, Lily, and several Forerunner models. However, older Forerunners like the now-retired 265 and 965 won’t be getting the new rucking features.</p><p>On top of the new rucking mode, you’ll now be able to add your pack’s weight to running, trail running, hiking, and walking profiles too — at least on the supported watch models.</p><p>This update means way more accurate stats, like VO2 max, calories burned, and elevation, especially when you’re hauling serious weight on your adventures.</p><p>There’s also a new "Breathing Variations" feature that taps into Pulse Ox data to give you a closer look at how your breathing shifts during sleep.</p><p>On top of that, this update spreads device passcodes to more watches that didn’t have them before. While the newer Venu, Vivoactive, and Forerunner models got passcodes earlier this year, now the Lily 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a>, and Instinct E series are joining them.</p><p>For all you marksmen out there, Garmin has added a new Stage Timer that keeps you in the zone with real-time alerts, either blasting through your watch speaker or quietly via your hearing protection.</p><p>If you’re on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus</a> or Outdoor Maps Plus, there’s a sweet new upgrade: Garmin Trails. It’s a smart trail finder built right into Garmin Connect and Explore to help you discover your next adventure without the guesswork.</p><p>Before you dive into the update, double-check that your watch is on the list of compatible models.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, when it comes to the best Android smartphone cameras, Motorola isn't often at the top of anyone's list, which is why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> is a welcome surprise for me.</p><p>The phone has an impressive camera system for a flip phone, and that's not just because it has three 50MP sensors. One of the most important changes is the switch to a secondary ultrawide sensor after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">the Razr Plus 2024 opted for a 2x telephoto lens</a>, giving the Razr Ultra more versatility than its predecessor.</p><p>However, Motorola's handling of its images has evolved in a way I didn't expect, and I can't help but think it has a lot to do with Pantone. With smartphone companies partnering with camera makers and the like to improve their images, Motorola was smart to do the same by collaborating with a company that pretty much sets the tone for… well, <em>tone</em>.</p><p>Here are the photos I've taken over the past few weeks and how they compare to those taken with other Android phones in my arsenal.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-camera-samples"><span>Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 camera samples</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3785px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hxPsJE64sUz2tUiCiY92y9" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-33" alt="Natural color style on the Razr Ultra 2025 camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hxPsJE64sUz2tUiCiY92y9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3785" height="2129" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Razr Ultra 2025</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Rear camera 1</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide, ƒ/1.8, OIS, 1.0μm (12.6MP, 2.0μm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Rear camera 2</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide+macro, ƒ/2.0, 122° FOV, 0.6μm (12.6MP, 1.2μm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Selfie camera</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide, ƒ/2.0, 0.64μm (12.6MP, 1.28μm)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As the specs above show, the phone features three 50MP cameras: two on the rear and one front-facing camera.</p><p>I've taken over 100 photos over the past few weeks, and I've noticed that colors pop more than I've seen in previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a> I've reviewed.

That said, last year's model holds its own and matches or bests the Ultra in some scenarios. Here are the camera specs for both:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Razr Ultra 2025</p></th><th  ><p>Razr Plus 2024</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Rear camera 1</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide, ƒ/1.8, OIS, 1.0μm (12.6MP, 2.0μm)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide, ƒ/1.7, OIS 0.8μm (12.6MP, 1.6μm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Rear camera 2</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide+macro, ƒ/2.0, 122° FOV, 0.6μm (12.6MP, 1.2μm)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 2x telephoto, ƒ/2.0, 0.64um (12.6MP, 1.28μm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Selfie camera</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide, ƒ/2.0, 0.64μm (12.6MP, 1.28μm)</p></td><td  ><p>32MP wide, ƒ/2.4, 0.7 μm, (8MP, 1.4um)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>During my testing, I chose to stick to the wide and 2x zoom shots since the Plus doesn't have an ultrawide sensor to provide wider shots. However, this also gave the Ultra a chance to show how Motorola's optical-quality in-sensor zoom can compare with an optical telephoto lens.</p><p>Generally, images from the Ultra appear much more vibrant and colorful than images from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, which look a bit dull by comparison. You'll also notice that the Razr Plus 2024 has a slightly shallower field of view, which is more of a downside since the phone already can't shoot ultrawide photos.</p><div class="inlinegallery

shots a little better in most cases. In nearly all scenarios, photos are overall brighter on the Plus, even if they're less vibrant. This is most obvious in the photo of the apartment building. You can also see in the photo of the weird tree that the Razr Ultra comes out a bit blurry, despite my attempts to keep as still as possible.</p><p>That said, the Ultra still manages to perform well at night, too, and the boost in saturation sometimes helps to make up for what it may lack in low-light capture.</p><p>As for zoom, the situation is similar, where images from the Ultra appear more vibrant and with more contrast. The difference in field of view is less noticeable here, and at first glance, the phones seem quite comparable in terms of quality and clarity.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

Smaller text is easier to make out on the Plus, while the Ultra will do its best to estimate what's there, making text look slightly messy. The brighter images can also help in some scenarios, but it's really only something you notice when you're looking really closely at a photo.</p><p>Unless you're cropping closely into an image, the difference in clarity is not too noticeable.</p><p>Overall, I would say that the Razr Ultra is the better option, only because I prefer the more vibrant images over the duller photos on the Plus. That said, I do think the Plus camera has improved since I reviewed it nearly a year ago, and it's possible Motorola made some tweaks to processing since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/android-15-is-widely-rolling-out-for-motorola-razr-plus-2024-owners-in-the-us">Android 15 update</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6"><span>Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CAc8Q22Rwng8nscAwdFLaa" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-01" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 and Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CAc8Q22Rwng8nscAwdFLaa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> isn't with us yet, I spent a great deal of time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">comparing the Razr Ultra with the Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, since, in my opinion, it bested the cameras on last year's Razr Plus. So, was the Ultra able to come out on top? Here are the camera specs for both phones:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Razr Ultra 2025</p></th><th  ><p>Galaxy Z Flip 6</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Rear camera 1</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide, ƒ/1.8, OIS, 1.0μm (12.6MP, 2.0μm)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide, ƒ/1.8, OIS, 1.0μm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Rear camera 2</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide+macro, ƒ/2.0, 122° FOV, 0.6μm (12.6MP, 1.2μm)</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide, ƒ/2.2, 1.12μm, 123˚ FOV</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Selfie camera</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide, ƒ/2.0, 0.64μm (12.6MP, 1.28μm)</p></td><td  ><p>10MP wide, ƒ/2.2, 1.22μm, 85˚ FOV</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In most instances, choosing between images taken by the Razr Ultra 2025 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> comes down to preference. Image output is often similar in terms of quality, exposure, contrast, and vibrancy. However, the biggest difference between these phones, especially in ideal lighting situations, is color temperature, where the Galaxy tends to lean ever so slightly cooler.</p><p>Even so, oftentimes, I cannot tell the difference between photos taken by these two phones in good lighting. If anything, the Razr Ultra will punch up the HDR a bit more and make the Galaxy images appear a bit dull by comparison. However, there are plenty of moments where images will look nearly identical.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row

of the detail.</p><p>As far as low-light, nighttime, and trickier lighting situations, the results are mostly the same. Both phones do some heavy post-processing when there's very little light to achieve more detail. In some situations, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 can take things up a notch, which can be good, but it can also go a little too far and overexpose some images to compensate for the lack of light, such as the photos of the Seattle Space Needle in the gallery below.</p><p>Furthermore, in the last two images, you can see how the Razr handles artificial light sources better, as the sign in the background is overexposed in the Galaxy's shot.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item"

The differences between these two phones are minor and mostly in color temperature, although the Razr opts for sharper details while the Galaxy Z Flip 6 leans a bit softer. However, unless you're zooming into shots after you take them, it'll be hard to see the difference at first glance.</p><p>It's only until you reach beyond that zoom level that things will break down, particularly for the Razr Ultra. The last photo below is taken at 10x zoom, with the Razr Ultra struggling to keep everything together while the Galaxy Z Flip 6 does a pretty good job of maintaining shapes and details, likely due to Samsung's AI processing.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0

In the two photos below of the bridge, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 does a better job with the sky, but a worse job highlighting the bridge in the second set of images, which appears darker than the rest. The OPPO Find N5 tends to brighten shadows more than the others, while the Pixel is a good medium with more contrast while retaining details in shadowy areas.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

It's been interesting to see the growth from the last two generations of Razr, from the relatively unusable camera on the Razr Plus 2023 to the perfectly fine setup on the Razr Plus 2024.</p><p>With Motorola's heavy focus on social media, it's not surprising that images are produced with punchy colors, and it's clear that the Pantone partnership has worked wonders for how images are processed. Improvements to HDR are also nice to see, and it finally feels like Motorola has found a winning formula for itself.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will step up to the challenge when it launches, but for now, I'm more than happy with the Razr Ultra 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You don't need to spend all that much to get a decent screen protection kit. Just get your priorities in order before picking a set. Do you want a privacy screen guard? Are you planning on using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-cases">case with your S25 Edge</a>? The answers to these questions create guidelines for your decision-making process.</p><p>The best overall selection is the AACL 3-Pack for Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Screen Protector Tempered Glass. AACL is a highly well-reviewed screen protector brand that doesn't cost much. For less than $20, you get a comprehensive three-pack that includes an installation frame, wipes, duster removers, a squeegee, and cleaning cloths. The tempered glass screen protectors boast a hardness level of 9H and the sides leave just enough space to make them case-friendly. Since there's no front camera cutout, you don't have to worry about dirt collecting in the notch. The only thing missing is a camera lens protector.</p><p>If you want an all-inclusive kit, then get the amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch for Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge instead. Although there's one less screen protector in the box compared to AACL, amFilm includes tempered glass camera lens protectors as well as an alignment tool. Both tempered glass screen guards have a hydrophobic layer on top, repelling sweat, oil, and fingerprint stains effectively. The price is significantly less than AACL's option too, so this is a value-packed alternative.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This slim new breed of Galaxy phones caters to the sort of user who values weightlessness. That's why I have prioritized thinness above all else when curating this buying guide for the best S25 Edge cases.</p><p>If price isn't a key factor, the CASETiFY S25 Edge Impact Magnetic Case is the best option from every viewpoint. It's a slim bumper cover that hardly adds anything to the S25 Edge, but at the same time, you don't have to sacrifice drop-proofing either. There's a magnetic ring baked into the case so it supports wireless charging and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">magnetic accessories</a>. CASETiFY has hundreds of unique designs, patterns, and customizability options. The brand's collaborations are on par with none other, partnering with global franchises like Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Jujitsu Kaisen. It's every pop culture nerd's dream phone case brand.</p><p>I'll admit, $70 for a phone cover might be too rich for your blood. If money is an object, avert your gaze from CASETiFY and look at brands like Spigen and Ringke. Both case makers make exceptionally durable and stylish phone covers for all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, but don't break the bank. For such a sleek device like the S25 Edge, I recommend the super-thin Thinborne Galaxy S25 Edge Aramid Fiber MagSafe Case above all else. It adds support for Qi2 and MagSafe accessories and the slim profile makes it a worthwhile buy, but the price tag is a little steep.</p> ]]></dc:content>
