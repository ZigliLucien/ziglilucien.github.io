With rumored features like a larger cover screen, a thinner chassis, a larger battery, and a more powerful chipset, the Z Flip 7 could be a significant upgrade over the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>Still, with the new model on the horizon, I thought I'd take a look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> to see how it has held up over the past year. While I've been predominantly fixated on last year's Razr Plus 2024 and this year's Razr Ultra, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 remains one of my favorite flip phones from Samsung, thanks to its solid hardware and reliable software experience.</p><p>Here are my biggest takeaways using the Galaxy Z Flip 6 over the past year and how I hope the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will improve on an already impressive phone.</p><h2 id="one-ui-7-transforms-this-phone-2">One UI 7 transforms this phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-welcome" alt="One UI 7 welcome screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sitting in front of colorful plants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div><blockquote><p>"...

Images have plenty of contrast, depth, and vibrancy."</p><p>Derrek Lee, 'Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review'</p></blockquote></div><p>Flip phone cameras aren't known to be particularly great and are normally limited to just two sensors. Samsung continues to make the best of the situation, particularly on the Galaxy Z Flip 6's upgraded 50MP primary camera. As I noted in my review, I remain pleased with the images from the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>More recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-camera-review">I compared Galaxy Z Flip 6 images to the new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, and Samsung's flip phone managed to keep up in most situations. The color temperature is slightly cooler, but images can look very similar between the two in good lighting conditions. I find the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra</a> images to be a massive achievement for Motorola, but the fact that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 can keep up is also impressive.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

low-light. Digital zoom quality actually somewhat compensates for the lack of a telephoto camera. While both phones offer lossless zoom at 2x, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 takes the lead at higher zoom ranges, maintaining a good level of detail even at 10x, whereas the Razr Ultra struggles.</p><p>Then there are low-light and nighttime images. Samsung does its best to brighten up photos, which can sometimes result in decent images. However, it can also overdo it, and images will come out fairly noisy, and as a result, images can look worse than those taken on the Razr Ultra 2025.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paWesQ48BXvhND8AyWkZCk" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-05.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paWesQ48BXvhND8AyWkZCk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But beyond picture quality, I've enjoyed actually <em>using </em>the cameras. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flip-phones-my-favorite-camera-tricks">The flip phone form factor enhances your camera experience</a> with its versatility, allowing you to capture selfies from the cover screen or enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-first-things#section-fold-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-90-degrees-and">Camcorder Mode</a> for quick, easy, and stable video recording.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung continues to hide a ton of useful camera settings in its Camera Assistant app, which doesn't come preinstalled.

Samsung continues to hinder the cover screen experience in the same ways that it did with the Galaxy Z Flip 5."</p><p>Derrek Lee, 'Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review'</p></blockquote></div><p>The cover screen experience on Samsung's Z Flip series has come a long way, particularly since the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Z Flip 5</a>. The 3.4-inch external display carried over to the Z Flip 6, giving users more robust cover screen panels, messaging, full camera previews, and more. Yet, despite having all this room for activities, Samsung still hides and hinders its best cover screen features.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">I tested the Z Flip 6 and Razr Plus 2024</a> to see how I would fare using only the cover screen for 24 hours. Unsurprisingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus</a> offered a much better experience, thanks to the larger 4-inch screen, the ability to use apps out of the box, cover screen multitasking, a more connected experience overall when it comes to app transitions across displays, and the way notifications are handled.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is unfortunately hindered by its smaller and awkwardly shaped display and the fact that the use of apps on the cover screen is still not "officially" supported. If you want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">use apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>, you must go through Good Lock to enable an app panel, and even then, the experience feels half-baked.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-cover-screen" alt="YouTube Music on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 (left) and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cover screen is limited to the Samsung Keyboard, and it occupies nearly the entire screen when in use. Multitasking is non-existent, so you have to fully exit an app before opening another. Furthermore, Samsung's decision to avoid placing the cameras <em>on</em> the cover panel results in an awkward screen shape, and the experience of using apps feels a bit claustrophobic.</p><p>In my experience, the lack of apps on the cover screen hasn't been a dealbreaker for people who I've met who use the Z Flip 5 or 6. In fact, after I show them that they <em>can </em>add apps, it feels more like a nice bonus for them, which somewhat works in Samsung's favor.</p><p>That said, it's not all bad, and there have been signs that Samsung is learning. As mentioned earlier, the cover screen enables some unique camera tricks that you won't find on a traditional candybar phone. Samsung also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-multistar-button">added a new button with One UI 7</a> that somewhat streamlines the option to add cover screen apps, which is a step in the right direction.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-z-flip-6-is-still-great-but-what-comes-next-2">The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is still great, but what comes next?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4206px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LJz33H2ujQaKK5kQ3vJgQX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-26.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 display folded at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LJz33H2ujQaKK5kQ3vJgQX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4206" height="2366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A year later, I still prefer Motorola's Razr series to Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6. That said, it remains a great choice for flip phone lovers, such as myself. It's a sturdy, well-built phone with impressive specs and plenty of helpful and fun AI features. I also <em>love </em>One UI 7, and I'm not afraid to admit that I'd rather have it on the Razr than Motorola's Hello UX. Plus, with 7 years of updates, the phone should provide plenty of value for years to come as new features and capabilities are added over time.</p><p>And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day</a> right around the corner, it's never been a better time to snag one at a discount, as there are already some pretty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">impressive Samsung deals</a> out there, especially if you want a 512GB Z Flip 6.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="889bab6a-2f1b-4610-b774-3ff9e9af3b7f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The 512GB Galaxy Z Flip 6 typically costs a pretty penny, and more than I would recommend anyone pay for this phone.

That's why comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-plus-2024">Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Razr Plus 2024</a> wasn't as cut-and-dry as you'd expect. One was a notable step forward that really focused on design and the cover screen experience, while the other was more of a spec bump that focused more on performance. That's why it feels like there's so much riding on the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7, as it may finally introduce the features we've been hoping for.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung is expected to introduce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7#section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-finally-a-cheaper-flip-phone">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a>, which is rumored to be a more affordable flip phone option (at least compared to the Z Flip 7). If rumors are correct, this phone could offer a nearly identical design to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, albeit with an Exynos chipset, which could complicate the Galaxy Z Flip 6's place in the lineup.</p><p>However, if getting the latest and greatest Samsung phone isn't for you, I'm confident that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will be more than sufficient for most users, even in 2025.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The mid-frame is made out of polycarbonate as well, and while you don't get the same premium feel as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic/redmagic-10s-pro-review">Redmagic 10S Pro</a>, the device is lighter than its predecessor.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qTWw9hTcitn2HTxdyBHamK" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qTWw9hTcitn2HTxdyBHamK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's an oblong camera island at the back, and its positioning on the left means there is a wobble when using the GT 30 Pro on a table. You'll need to use the bundled case to mitigate this, and Infinix does a good job with accessories — you get a 45W charger in addition to a case in the package.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="y6ktMZ9VZrnbEUtgCWLKjK" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y6ktMZ9VZrnbEUtgCWLKjK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Infinix sells a Gaming Kit that includes the MagCharge Cooler accessory, and this is essentially a fan that you mount on the back of the GT 30 Pro to assist with active thermal management.

I like that Infinix added ultrasonic triggers on the right side; they sit flush with the body and aren't noticeable, and they let you easily assign in-game actions.</p><p>There's IP64 ingress protection, and while it doesn't cover immersion in water, it is decent enough in most day-to-day scenarios.

Obviously, you won't get a camera as good as the Pixel 9a in this category, but considering what it costs, the GT 30 Pro has a good shooter overall. The auxiliary 8MP wide-angle is average, but it is more useful than the pitiful 2MP macro lens Infinix tacked on to the back of the GT 20 Pro last year.</p><h2 id="decent-software-with-a-caveat-2">Decent software — with a caveat</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eWXkBZn3L8BnZms4hQ7WhK" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWXkBZn3L8BnZms4hQ7WhK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The GT 30 Pro runs Infinix's XOS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and the interface doesn't have too much in the way of overt customization.

Chromebooks are generally less powerful than regular laptops, but they&apos;re almost always more affordable and lightweight, making them the perfect choice for students and casual users. </p><p>Chromebooks also have a few convenient features that aren&apos;t usually found on traditional laptops, such as lightning-fast startups, automatic updates from Google, and convertible, flip-and-fold designs. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u9U7qzP4Jmf69urvjAuszg" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-10-16x9.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus review hero 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u9U7qzP4Jmf69urvjAuszg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-prime-day-2025-2">Do I have to be a Prime member to shop during Prime Day 2025?</h2><p>Most of the best deals during Prime Day 2025 will be exclusive to Prime members, so now would be a good time to sign up if you&apos;ve been thinking about it.

The post alleges the next V Flip is expected to see an upgrade in one department: its battery. DCS claims Honor is preparing a 1,770mAh and 3,600mAh battery setup inside the V Flip 2. Come launch, there's speculation that the market could see its battery capacity rated at around 5,500mAh.</p><p>It's charging still seems to be up in the air, as DCS suggests Chinese consumers could see 66W or 80W wired charging capabilities.</p><p>If you're expecting other major upgrades, that might not happen. DCS states that the V Flip 2 "has not changed much" from the clamshell's first appearance in 2024. Supposedly, the phone will still retain its 4-inch FHD Plus cover and 6.8-inch internal displays.</p><p>The post states Honor is reportedly chasing a "sub-flagship" Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 series chip. The device could sport a 50MP dual camera array. Lastly, the tipster alleges that Honor is seeking an August 2025 release date for the Magic V Flip 2.</p><h2 id="looks-like-the-magic-v5-got-all-the-magic-2">Looks like the Magic V5 got all the...

The clamshell launched last June, essentially preparing to take on Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 the month after. The device launched with a 4-inch cover and a 6.8-inch internal display, which we've seen rumored once again for its sequel. While the camera looks to remain the same, too, the battery might see a boost over the original's 4,800mAh setup.</p><p>What's more, Honor's alleged choice to grab a "sub-flagship" Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 chip echoes what it did last year. The O.G. V Flip debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1.</a> The chip was a "refresh" of the flagship 8 Gen 1 that launched the fall prior—in 2021. So, Honor went for a two-year-old chip. With rumors claiming that Honor will do it again—"again" meaning a sub-flagship chip—perhaps we're looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.</a></p><p>We'll have to wait and see where things lie, especially if we're to expect this phone in a month.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Honor revealed its Magic V5</a> this week. The company's thinnest-ever foldable is a sleek new piece of competition for Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7. When folded, the phone measures 8.8mm (4.1mm when opened). Display-wise, Honor outfits the phone with a 7.9-inch internal display and a 6.4-inch cover screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster claims the Pixel Watch 4 will be available in a 41mm and a 45mm option. The company is also preparing the following color/band color choices: Black/Obsidian, Gold/Lemon, Silver/Porcelain, Silver/Iris, and Moonstone.</p><p>What's unclear is if both size options will see the same color options. If we remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">the Pixel Watch 3</a>, its 41mm and 45mm options don't feature the same stylistic choices, as the former tosses in a Champagne color and even a Rose band.</p><p>Regarding the next-gen bands, the tipster states the Pixel Watch 4 will see a multitude (roughly seven) bands with different colors. The Woven band is rumored to arrive in Indigo, while the two-tone leather option could see a Jade choice. There's an Active Band (Iris, Lemongrass, Moonstone), an Active Sports Band (Indigo, Lemongrass, Moonstone, Peony), and a Classic Leather in Moonstone.</p><h2 id="looking-ahead-to-the-pixel-watch-4-2">Looking Ahead to the Pixel Watch 4</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Pixel Watch 4:WiFi/LTE41mm/45mmBlack/ObsidianGold/LemonMoonstoneSilver/IrisSilver/Porcelain<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1941026391648358465">July 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The Metal Mesh band could debut in Matte Black and Polished Silver, leaving the Performance Loop in Moonstone.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster alleges the following Gradient Stretch band options in sizes one through five:</p><ul><li>Lemongrass/Frost</li><li>Moonstone</li><li>Obsidian/Hazel</li><li>Peony/Iris</li></ul><p>Pixel Watch 4 rumors have been light so far; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">a massive render leak</a> from April left us a little impressed. The supposed images showed off a watch that is looking to improve its display experience. The Pixel Watch 4 may sport thinner bezels under the circular domed glass aesthetic that's become enjoyable. There were some alleged changes, like the removal of its charging pogo pins.</p><p>It's left to speculation to believe that Google is working on introducing a wireless charging method for its next watch. Elsewhere, the rumored renderings showcased two extra cutouts on either side of the device's speaker, likely for its physical buttons.</p><p>One concerning aspect was the Watch 4's supposed thickness increase; however, that could be a result of a bigger battery.</p><p>This is also the second time we've heard a tipster claim the watch will arrive in 41mm and 45mm options, so perhaps there's merit. Either way, we're expecting the Pixel Watch 4 to debut alongside the Pixel 10 series, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">could take place in late August</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've been using an Apple Watch user for a while now, starting with a Series 6 and later upgrading to a Series 8 when it was released three years ago. So for about five years now, I've had a bulky square-ish dial on my wrist- and I still do, as I type this article. On the flip side, I've owned the Oura Ring 4 for only about 3 weeks now, and it has become this silent source of encouragement pushing me to take care of myself while I go about my life.</p><p>As a first-time mom, my sleep cycle has been erratic, to say the least, with frequent nightly wake-ups to feed my infant. This is exactly why I needed to know if I was getting optimal rest and if my health was truly supporting my ability to function during the day. This was the primary reason behind trying out the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>, which, when compared to a smartwatch, is manageable to sleep with.</p><p>Now, I use the Oura Ring 4 all the time as an overall health tracker, while the Apple Watch sticks to being my fitness companion.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>Prime Day returns July 8th: check out our ultimate guide</strong></em></a></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="axmwd7zeesP3HfUoZLueME" name="Oura-Ring-4" alt="Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/axmwd7zeesP3HfUoZLueME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="no-nonsense-sleep-tracking-2">No-nonsense sleep tracking</h2><p>While setting up my Oura Ring, the app asked me a bunch of questions to determine whether I had any special circumstances or health issues that could impact my readings, to which I ticked off the option of having small kids at home, acknowledging the fact that this could affect my sleep score.</p><p>For instance, after a night of only about 5.7 hours of sleep, my Oura Ring app presented a detailed picture of my breathing patterns and heart rate, in addition to the standard awake time, REM sleep, deep sleep, and so on. This analysis put things into perspective for me, and the app gave me suggestions as to how I could avoid a long afternoon nap so I could get my sleep cycle back in sync, asking me to wind down during the night with a book or a quick mindfulness session, or taking steps to improve my sleep quality at night. While the advice didn't stem from the fact that I was frequently waking up because my infant needed me, it did give me actionable items that helped me understand my sleep scores better.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 tracks sleep using a special "Smart sensing" technology that involves a combination of advanced sensors that are fitted into the ring, along with machine-learning algorithms that are specifically trained to track different stages of sleep. It also has sensors that track your oxygen, heart, and respiratory rate to understand how your body functions when you sleep.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7rrzstrShf3p2a8XygpWej" name="Oura-metabolic-features" alt="Sleep tracking on Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7rrzstrShf3p2a8XygpWej.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="oura-s-ai-powered-advisor-2">Oura's AI-powered Advisor </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cHvs3HGdtSYjicdggj9BZ4" name="Oura-Ring-4" alt="Oura Ring 4 Stress detection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHvs3HGdtSYjicdggj9BZ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who is constantly juggling multiple responsibilities — from managing my role as a News editor, and also navigating the unpredictable challenges that come with having an infant, stress can easily become something that goes under the radar, manifesting as a headache or just pure anxiety, as I transition between home and work, without a moment to myself.</p><p>This is when Oura's AI-powered Advisor comes into play. The sensors constantly monitor my physiological state, and when the smart ring tracks that I'm experiencing elevated levels of stress based on my heart rate variability (HRV), the app instantly sends me a quick notification to take a look at the stats and possibly step back and "breathe the stress away" with a quick four-minute mindfulness session that gives me the much needed moment of calm amidst the daily chaos.</p><p>Beyond that, the Oura Ring 4 also doubles as a subtle activity coach. Instead of constantly bugging me with reminders to "close rings", it gently nudges me to get in 3-4 minutes of movement when it detects longer periods of inactivity.  While I still track my workouts with the Watch, these soft reminders from the Oura Advisor actually play a crucial role in keeping me on track with my fitness goals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iTBvfVcAJsTFwoNBDcWiHA" name="Oura-metabolic-features" alt="Oura annouces new features to track meals" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iTBvfVcAJsTFwoNBDcWiHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While those were the main reasons why I primarily use the Oura Ring 4, I sometimes also track my steps with it when I don't have my watch on. However, another cool feature that I'm currently experimenting with is "Meals," a super-easy way to keep track of what you're eating in a day. Unlike traditional food tracking apps that require users to manually input data, which again is time-consuming to me, all I have to do is take a picture of my plate, and this AI feature will break things down for me. It shows me each "Meal Item" and the nutrients my plate contains, helping me reach for healthier options.</p><p>So if you're a first-time mom juggling work and the challenges that come with having a tiny human at home, then this ring-sized motivator is for you. It will keep track of your sleep, stress, and sanity. The best part is that you don't have to reach for the charger as often as you would for an Apple Watch, as it offers up to 8 days of battery on a single charge.</p><p>While the Oura Ring 4 (starting around $349) is on the more expensive side, it's worth noting that the Oura Ring 3 has currently crashed back to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Tracking-Wearable-Fitness/dp/B0D9WVSZ56"><strong>lowest price at Amazon ahead of Prime Day,</strong></a> offering a more accessible entry point into Oura's excellent tracking capabilities.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a204f539-7986-4c6d-88af-34bdfa5a8eab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.00" data-dimension48="$249.00" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRLTZGL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:83.27%;"><img id="JZJBFcjUeoiAA6ntbDbch5" name="oura-ring-gen-3" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JZJBFcjUeoiAA6ntbDbch5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1249" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Oura Ring Gen 3 (Heritage Silver):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRLTZGL" target="_blank" data-dimension112="a204f539-7986-4c6d-88af-34bdfa5a8eab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.00" data-dimension48="$249.00" data-dimension25=""><del>$249.00</del> <strong>$199.00 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Days before <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Prime Day</a> officially kicks off on July 8th, buyers can get $50 off the Oura Ring 3 smart ring, representing a 20% discount on a great last-generation device.

For a good chunk of the past year, the Z Fold 6 has either been my primary or secondary phone, only being swapped out with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>Despite being a huge fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 just didn't spark the same level of excitement that I've felt elsewhere. I've already written about how Samsung played it safe with an iterative design, only to release a more modern iteration with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Z Fold Special Edition</a>, which was limited to a handful of regions.</p><h2 id="what-s-the-problem-2">What's the problem?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qetCRBRLHzRwPwfLRJywv4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qetCRBRLHzRwPwfLRJywv4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem is that, for the most part, the Fold 6 has been the phone that I keep coming back to, time and time again. I revisited the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-oneplus-open-as-good-as-i-remember">OnePlus Open</a> in anticipation of an Open 2 that never arrived, but still ended up back on the Samsung train. The only phone that has managed to pull me away has been the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, especially now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/googles-on-the-right-track-with-desktop-mode-in-android-16">Desktop Mode has arrived with Android 16</a>.</p><p>Why is that a problem? When you see phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, and even the Huawei Mate XT being released, the Z Fold 6 simply looks outdated. It's kind of like how the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> looked like it was supposed to originally launch in 2020, but for whatever reason, was held back until 2023.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-promo-render.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1131" height="636" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On top of that, the Z Fold Special Edition was basically proof that Samsung could release a modern foldable with better cameras, a bigger screen, and all of the things I've been hoping for. So when we see reports and rumors about sales figures being down, it doesn't come as a shock, considering that it's really just Samsung, Google, and Motorola in the space, at least until we get a proper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open successor.</a></p><h2 id="why-do-i-keep-coming-back-2">Why do I keep coming back?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So if the hardware and specs are such a letdown, why do I keep coming back to the Z Fold 6 at all? Everything else.</p><p>The thing about this phone is that if I really had to, I could use this for literally everything. Its narrow cover screen is great for doom-scrolling or replying to messages, and if I need more space to spread out, I can just unfold it. If I need to sketch something out or jot down a note, I can just grab an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen</a> and be on my way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW" name="multi-window-galaxy-z-fold-6.jpg" alt="Multi-window apps on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Do I need even more space? Then I can plug in my handy-dandy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/nexdock-wireless-review">NexDock</a> and turn the Fold 6 into a laptop via DeX. And if I'm <em>really</em> in a pinch, then I can pair my Samsung ultrawide monitor with the Fold 6 and use DeX that way. But that's more a last-ditch effort kind of thing since DeX doesn't really play nice with ultrawide monitors.</p><p>And when it comes to multi-tasking <em>without</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">DeX</a>, Samsung has my current favorite implementation. Basically, there aren't any major limitations. I'm able to have more than two or three apps appear on the screen, and can easily swap them out or just pull up a floating window. Admittedly, the only time I do that is to access my password manager or if I'm watching football while checking fantasy scores.</p><h2 id="surprising-discovery-2">Surprising discovery</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cdQA2KorHMoyDwaUUqca7d" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-oneplus-open-cover-screens-angled.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel Fold, OnePlus Open and Galaxy Z Fold 6 showing cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdQA2KorHMoyDwaUUqca7d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is one thing I've noticed regarding the design, and it's that I'm much more likely to use the inner screen on the Fold 6 than the other foldable phones I have. It's not like I can't do anything from the cover screen, but it's simply too narrow.</p><p>That's not the case with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which features the same 6.3-inch display as the Pixel 9 Pro. I'd be lying if I said that there haven't been days when I don't use the inner screen on the 9 Pro Fold. But unless my memory is failing me, I can't remember a day when I didn't unfold the Z Fold 6 at least once.</p><p>Naturally, I'll be paying closer attention to this once I get my hands on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, provided that the rumors and leaks are true about the larger screens.</p><h2 id="battery-life-is-awful-2">Battery life is awful</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LVqsULGGvGKFz8YihJWDYM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-battery-settings" alt="Battery settings on Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LVqsULGGvGKFz8YihJWDYM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gripes about the hardware aside, that's not the only area that Samsung needs to improve on. Battery life on the Fold 6 has been absolutely atrocious. More often than not, it won't last until the early evening without needing to be charged to make it through the rest of the day.</p><p>Obviously, a foldable is a bit different when compared to a slab phone, but surely Samsung knows that this isn't good enough. I'm not even talking about charging speeds, but having the 4,400mAh battery is the smallest of the other recent foldable phones. Vivo recently unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-bridging-the-gap-android-apple-watch-launch">X Fold 5</a> and managed to squeeze a 6,000mAh battery, while the Find N5 offers a 5,600mAh cell.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vBifQQJF8n4WyZKjCNuWh4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 battery stats" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBifQQJF8n4WyZKjCNuWh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I understand there are ways to try and remedy this, but I didn't take any of those approaches. For one, it's extremely annoying and time-consuming to reset and restore a phone, especially one that you've been using for the better part of a year. More importantly, I would have to assume that the majority of people don't wipe and restore their phones once a year, so I decided against doing so.</p><p>Everything was fine in the beginning, easily making it through a day. But less than a year later, the Fold 6 barely lasts eight hours, and that's just unacceptable.</p><h2 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TQja9cmEBV6Bs9MBcqfnxk" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-23.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on top of Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQja9cmEBV6Bs9MBcqfnxk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's kind of a weird thing, as I've been trying to gather my thoughts and feelings, but just coming back to the same conclusion: I'm beyond ready for the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Samsung was once at the top of the mountain when it came to foldable phones, but stood pat while the competition ran circles around them.</p><p>All of the leaks and rumors suggest that Samsung will be implementing quite a few new changes. I'm of the mindset that it'll basically be the Z Fold Special Edition, with newer internals while hopefully retaining S Pen compatibility. And even with all of these supposed changes, there's a chance that the Fold 7 might not even be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak">star of the show</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e60ce6f5-a5db-4c60-9dc2-a492de3f6dcc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 really is a Swiss Army Knife, as it can pretty much do whatever you want.

The company has confirmed a mandatory update landing soon that’ll rein in your battery once it hits around 400 charge cycles in order to keep the phone from running too hot and steer clear of any meltdown-level surprises.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16340779" target="_blank">community post</a>, Google gave Pixel 6a owners a heads-up about a mandatory <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> update rolling out starting July 8 intended to deliver "important battery management features" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2025/07/02/google-clears-all-pixel-6a-factory-images/" target="_blank">Droid Life</a>).</p><p>The upcoming update takes place only if your phone is flagged as an “Impacted Device.” If you’re on that list, your battery capacity and charging speed will take a slight hit to prevent potential overheating.</p><h2 id="only-some-phones-are-affected-2">Only some phones are affected</h2><p>Google hasn’t exactly spelled out what makes a Pixel 6a an “Impacted Device,” but the guess is it comes down to differences in battery or charging hardware. Some units might have slight variations in components that make them more prone to overheating, so the upcoming battery limits are likely aimed at keeping those specific phones in check.</p><p>If your Pixel 6a falls under Google’s Impacted Device label, expect a mandatory battery tweak coming with the Android 16 update. Affected phones will see a noticeable drop in battery life.</p><p>If your Pixel 6a isn’t on the list, you’ve got nothing to worry about. The Android 16 update’s still coming your way on July 8, but your battery and charging speeds will stay just the way they are.</p><p>This battery update is Google’s response to earlier reports of Pixel 6a units running dangerously hot, including a few cases where phones reportedly caught fire. By dialing down battery voltage, the update aims to stop those issues before they happen again.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="e2rAyZSRn4dBPRitNqvkaT" name="Google-Pixel-6a-camera-bar-back-angle-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2rAyZSRn4dBPRitNqvkaT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="deja-vu-for-pixel-4a-owners-2">Déjà vu for Pixel 4a owners</h2><p>Not long ago, Google slashed the Pixel 4a’s battery capacity with a surprise update, and now it’s the Pixel 6a’s turn. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-pixel-6a-likely-to-receive-mandatory-update-to-prevent-battery-issues">announced in mid-June</a> that a similar tweak was on the way, so this shouldn't come as a surprise.</p><p>Just to be clear, the battery limit won’t kick in right away. Your Pixel 6a has to hit 400 full charge cycles before anything changes. And if you're getting close, you’ll get a heads-up at 375 cycles so you’re not caught off guard.</p><p>On the other hand, if you’re not thrilled about the upcoming battery limits, Google is giving a few compensation options, including free battery swaps or even a cash payout.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, one that has been rising up the ranks lately is Nothing. The British company founded by Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus, makes products that are distinctive in design and that are finding their way to the North American market. In fact, the Phone 3 is one of two<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-ceo-shares-more-details-on-us-and-canada-presence-of-phone-3"> </a>Nothing devices to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-ceo-shares-more-details-on-us-and-canada-presence-of-phone-3">officially available and on sale in the U.S.</a> from the brand, with guaranteed compatibility with all U.S. networks.</p><p>So, if you’re looking for a solid Android phone that won’t break the bank, you might be considering the new Nothing Phone 3 or even last year’s Google Pixel 9. Both are great choices, but they are night and day in some ways. This Nothing Phone 3 vs. Google Pixel 9 comparison will help you decide.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-google-pixel-9-looks-and-basics-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Google Pixel 9: Looks and basics</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2YEAJkDKT38T8rqmJ9Yxx" name="nothing-phone-3-official-black-and-white" alt="Official imagery of the Nothing Phone 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YEAJkDKT38T8rqmJ9Yxx.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to looks, there’s no doubt that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-launch">Nothing Phone 3</a>, as with Nothing’s other products, stands out. It employs the company’s signature translucent design. However, it has a new iteration of the Glyph interface called Glyph Matrix, which features a micro LED screen on the back instead of a series of LEDs arranged across the back. This is an actual functional screen that can subtly show details like battery life, stopwatch, mirror, digital clock, solar clock, and even Bespoke games.</p><p>Like the traditional glyph interface found in other Nothing phones, it also offers progress indicators and contact notifications to help minimize distractions. With an SDK published for the Glyph Matrix, you might see other games made available from third-party companies that can leverage this back screen in the future.</p><p>The phone comes in white or black with Nothing’s signature transparent-like design and a 6.67-inch flexible AMOLED screen that boasts 1,260 x 2,800 pixel resolution, 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and up to 4,500 nits peak brightness for viewability even in direct sunlight. Covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 7i, it also comes with a pre-applied screen protector, a nice and appreciated touch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9McZxgmYQPaA827As7uZ33" name="nothing-phone-3-official-lifestyle-01" alt="Official imagery of the Nothing Phone 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9McZxgmYQPaA827As7uZ33.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Available with either 256GB or 512GB storage, the phone meets IP68 certification for water and dust resistance and comes with a pair of HD mics, stereo speakers, and a fingerprint sensor.</p><p>The 5,150mAh battery (5,500mAh in India only) lasts all day and supports 65W fast wired charging as well as 15W wireless charging.

The primary sensor includes optical image stabilization (OIS), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-shows-off-phone-3s-periscope-lens-in-its-latest-tease">the periscope camera</a> has OIS with 3x optical zoom and 60x ultra zoom, and the front-facing camera has a 114-degree field-of-view, ideal for group selfies.</p><p>It leverages a TrueLens Engine 4, affording features like Ultra XDR, auto tone, portrait optimizer, motion capture mode, night mode, macro mode, and action mode.

While the Google Pixel 9 doesn’t have a telephoto camera, Lee says he didn’t really miss it.</p><p>The standout for the cameras with the Google Pixel 9 is all the AI goodies thrown in for helping you capture and edit amazing photos.

When comparing the Nothing Phone 3 vs. Google Pixel 9, it really comes down to design and brand preference. The two phones are equal in many ways, including affordability, features, and specs.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 has a leg up on the Google Pixel 9 in a few ways when it comes to specs alone, including more RAM and storage with the 512GB edition, a larger and higher-res screen, higher brightness, a bigger battery with faster charging, and a better front camera. But these aren’t small details; they can be deciding factors for some.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9, however, provides an unmatched AI experience with Google Gemini, impacting everything from productivity to entertainment and photo capture. From a modern phone perspective, it’s the best value you’ll find for an AI-powered phone at a reasonable price.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3867px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2TMTeyPhE9UQt7sKZ6LjBW" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-12.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 on its side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2TMTeyPhE9UQt7sKZ6LjBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3867" height="2175" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nothing Phone 3 has, of course, its cool and distinctive design with the standout new Glyph interface. The back screen can be useful and help you reduce distractions since you can see essential details without turning the phone over to view the main screen. The Essential Space is also a helpful way to keep you apprised of things without unlocking and diving into other things on the phone. The Google Pixel 9 is an attractive phone, but by comparison, it looks ordinary. With that said, you might prefer it.</p><p>Since both offer seven years of security updates, you’re safe with either choice when it comes to longevity and resale value. You do get an extra two years of OS upgrades with the Google Pixel 9, but that’s really only one year now since the phone launched last year.</p><p>Bottom line: if you like the idea of being different and sporting a funky phone that will turn heads and spark conversation, the Nothing Phone 3 has solid specs that rival those of the Google Pixel 9. If you want something simpler in design that still sports impressive specs at a good price, and will bring you into the world of AI, the Google Pixel 9 is still one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">the best small phones</a> you can buy.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f2d81c5e-958e-47f9-afb6-0e7a2f55d2cc">            <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/phone-3" data-model-name="Nothing Phone 3" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdeEWY6LkaLEKRNnhJp4dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the black Nothing Phone 3"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>It's more than nothing</strong></em></p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 is more than just a funky phone that will turn heads.

With 4th of July festivities underway, U.S. skies are about to pop with color from fireworks shows across the country. In fact, some fireworks shows are already starting early and will continue through the weekend.</p><p>If you plan on taking photos of the bright skies, you'll be happy to know that your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">favorite Android phone</a> is more than capable of capturing the moment. However, simply pointing your phone camera at the sky and shooting photos won't lead to the best results. You need to tweak your phone's camera settings and add accessories if you have them to get the perfect shot.</p><p>These are the top five tips and tricks every Android phone user should know about snapping firework photos ahead of the 4th of July weekend.</p><h2 id="use-a-tripod-for-stabilization-2">Use a tripod for stabilization </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="De4mBTZXxZBqq8h2AQc8rV" name="Peak-Design-Mobile-Tripod.jpg" alt="A Pixel phone on a Peak Design Mobile Tripod." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/De4mBTZXxZBqq8h2AQc8rV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Firework photos can be tricky to capture, and for good reason. When fireworks explode into the night sky, your phone is trying to capture insanely bright colors in a dark environment. Computational photography in smartphones is advanced, but it can still struggle in situations like this. It needs to figure out how much light to take in while capturing moving objects.</p><p>Holding your phone steady is the most important way to make sure your fireworks photos don't turn out blurry or grainy. If you have a tripod, you should use it. I prefer the Peak Design Mobile Tripod — it's compact and stable.</p><p>However, you don't need to spend a bunch of money to stabilize your phone camera. Think about whether you have a phone case with a kickstand, a battery bank that doubles as a phone stand, or a phone wallet that can prop up your device. Anything that can provide extra stabilization will do, so use what you have. If you do want to buy a dedicated solution, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-tripod">a guide to the best phone tripods</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, if you have a flip phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, then you probably won't need one, as you can just place it on a flat surface and angle the top portion of the screen. Big foldables such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> will work in a similar fashion. It's your own built-in tripod!</p><h2 id="manually-control-your-exposure-2">Manually control your exposure </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-camera-01" alt="Taking a macro shot of red flowers with the Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lighting is the key to whether your phone takes great firework photos or obnoxiously bad ones. That doesn't mean you should turn on the flash — it'll do more harm than good. Instead, you'll need to manually control your phone's exposure setting. This will dictate how much light the camera captures, preventing overexposed and grainy shots.</p><p>If that sounds hard, don't worry, it isn't. In fact, you're probably already doing it. You can easily set the exposure by tapping and holding the brightest part of the screen in your camera's viewfinder and watching the exposure self-correct. During a fireworks show, you'll want to point the phone at the sky, tap one of the exploding fireworks, and lock the exposure level in place. This way, you'll only have to do it once for the entire show.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dmDtvregzsdAPzytNesRag" name="Samsung-Camera-Lock-Exposure" alt="Setting manual exposure on the Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dmDtvregzsdAPzytNesRag.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On a Pixel phone, tapping and holding on the brightest part of your screen until you see a lock icon appear will set the exposure level. Samsung Galaxy users should tap and hold until the exposure UI appears, where they can manually drag the exposure slider and press the lock icon to set it. In this type of situation, less brightness (exposure) is better — the fireworks will do the job of lighting up the sky for you.</p><h2 id="use-night-or-astrophotography-modes-2">Use night or astrophotography modes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Yoq6V8p3eTw25tMuprxCU" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-4" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris using the Pixel Camera app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Yoq6V8p3eTw25tMuprxCU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You might prefer to set your exposure manually, but alternatively, night mode can be a simpler way to prepare your phone camera for fireworks shows. Night modes are designed to lengthen the exposure time, resulting in a sharper image. This can be a good thing, but the longer exposure time means stabilization is even more important — you'll really want to use a tripod or phone stand in this mode.</p><p>On a Google Pixel phone, you can activate night mode by swiping through the Pixel Camera app modes until you find <strong>Night Sight</strong>. Samsung Galaxy phone users will need to swipe until they see a <strong>More</strong> tab, and then tap <strong>Night</strong>.</p><p>If your phone has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-camera-astrophotography-manual-control">astrophotography mode</a>, you can try capturing firework photos with this toggle. Some users have had a lot of success taking firework shots with this mode, but it really wasn't designed with this purpose in mind, so we wouldn't recommend using it for <em>all</em> your shots.

Videos are far more flexible than photos for a few reasons. For starters, you can take photos <em>while</em> recording your video, so you get the best of both worlds. It's also possible to grab a specific frame from a video after the fact to use as a standalone photo. Finally, you can adjust exposure while recording a video by tapping the screen.</p><p>For all these reasons, videos might give you the best chance at getting a great photo if you're overwhelmed by all the settings and options in this guide. It'll simply give you more source material to work with, and sometimes, finding the perfect firework shot is a numbers game.</p><p>While there are a ton of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">great Android camera phones</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a> and Galaxy S25 series are probably best suited for fireworks photography.

Not only do you have to contend with different categories of glasses (AI glasses, smart display glasses, true wireless glasses, etc), but you also have to consider whether your devices work properly with your choice of glasses. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> are typically plug-and-play, but a few companies like to make things difficult.</p><p>I'm looking at you, Nintendo. With the Switch 2, Nintendo has yet again made it impossible to plug a pair of smart glasses directly into the system and play, even though the company included a perfectly good top-mounted USB-C port.</p><p>Thankfully, I've tested dozens of smart glasses and know exactly what combination you need to play your Switch 2 games on the go with a gorgeous OLED display right in front of your face — no neck pain involved! I've also tested them on several other systems and handhelds, including the Steam Deck, PS5, and plenty of smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

This problem existed with the original Nintendo Switch and, unfortunately, means that you'll likely always need some kind of adapter or dock plugged into your Switch 2 to use a pair of smart glasses with it.</p><p>Thankfully, Viture's got your back. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0D3LT6BJW/">Viture Pro Mobile Dock</a> can be plugged into your Switch 2, tricking the system into thinking it's plugged into a TV. You'll then plug a pair of smart glasses into the Viture dock and enjoy gaming on a giant virtual screen. As a bonus, this dock has a 10,000mAh power bank built in, so you'll get several additional hours of gameplay compared to the Switch 2's normal battery life.</p><p>Of course, like with anything involving Nintendo hardware, you'll have to take an extra step to get things working properly the first time around. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Once you get your Viture Pro Mobile Dock, you'll want to visit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://static.viture.com/dfu-util/viture-pro-mobile-dock.html"><strong>Viture firmware update page</strong></a><strong> </strong>on a PC or Mac using a Chromium-based browser (Chrome or Edge are fine).</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Plug the mobile dock into your computer using the short USB-C cable that came with your Viture dock, then click the <strong>connect button</strong>.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Select <strong>Mobile Dock</strong> from the pop-up list of devices and click <strong>connect</strong>.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Select the firmware that says <strong>For Switch 2 Only</strong> from the list of available firmware versions. As of this writing, that is version 2.01.03.0.02_20250613.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Click the <strong>update button</strong> to switch your Viture Pro Mobile Dock over to the Switch 2-compatible firmware.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> If it was successful, you'll see a pop-up message that says <strong>"Your firmware is now on the selected version."</strong></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2442px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.70%;"><img id="ZjRjpeNMP4Ex42R2w4LxCd" name="viture-pro-mobile-dock-switch-2-firmware-update-how-to" alt="How to switch your Viture Pro Mobile Dock's firmware over to the Switch 2-compatible version" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjRjpeNMP4Ex42R2w4LxCd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2442" height="1873" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, your Viture Pro Mobile Dock has the right security keys to work with the Switch 2.

The firmware update website tells you which version works with the original Switch, so just follow the above steps and swap out the firmware with the other version if you need to do that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="n6w5K8Q7m4C3ogo6dp5YXd" name="Viture-XR-Pro-Glasses-Pro-Mobile-Dock-and-Switch-2" alt="The Nintendo Switch 2 sitting face downward with the Viture Pro Mobile Dock sitting atop it and Viture Pro XR glasses sitting above it, wired to the Dock." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n6w5K8Q7m4C3ogo6dp5YXd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Time to pick your smart glasses! Viture obviously hopes that you'll use its smart glasses with its dock, but this dock is designed to be a universal accessory that works with any glasses or monitor you plug into it. My recommendation is to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rayneo-air-3s-review">RayNeo Air 3S</a>, as these are the least expensive smart glasses you can buy and offer 3840Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> at all brightness levels, making them an excellent choice for your wallet <em>and</em> your eyes.</p><p>While I might normally recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3LRH8G4">Viture Pro smart glasses</a>, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-of-awe-2025-coolest-xr-demos-niantic-viture-sony-android-xr">has a new pair coming soon</a> that you should probably wait for. At the very least, a new pair of glasses should mean the older pair sees a good discount.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z5kUdK86Erw4NpWtRtcND8" name="viture-pro-mobile-dock-with-viture-xreal-rayneo-glasses" alt="The Viture One Mobile Dock surrounded by several pairs of smart display glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z5kUdK86Erw4NpWtRtcND8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal Air glasses also seem to work fine with the dock, but for some reason, Xreal One and Xreal One Pro don't. You'll just end up with a yellow and red display on these if you try to plug them in. As these products are made by different companies, it's not terribly surprising to see incompatibilities from time to time.</p><p>Xreal has a product coming later this year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xreal/comments/1l85w66/new_xreal_neo_battery_pack_with_video_passthrough/">called Xreal Neo</a> that works quite similarly to the Viture Pro Mobile Dock, except that it won't need its firmware switched to work with all systems. Yes, that includes a Switch 2. At the least, if you already have a pair of Xreal One glasses and don't fancy buying another pair just to work with your Switch 2, I'd recommend waiting until the Xreal Neo adapter comes out later this year to get things working.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-glasses-for-the-steam-deck-rog-ally-lenovo-legion-etc"><span>Best smart glasses for the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion, etc.</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JWjcCPRQU8f3m6WjHg76GX" name="steam-deck-xreal-one-pro" alt="A Steam Deck and Xreal One Pro glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JWjcCPRQU8f3m6WjHg76GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Steam Deck, ROG Ally, etc, are all essentially just portable computers that are ready to be plugged into a monitor or TV for bigger play. In this case, we're plugging a pair of smart glasses into the USB-C port, which the system thinks is just another TV or monitor. That means the best smart glasses for systems like the Steam Deck mainly revolve around your own needs rather than some complicated tech workaround.</p><p>I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-pro-and-xreal-eye-deliver-a-new-vision-for-smart-glasses">Xreal One Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> smart glasses for the Steam Deck, ROG Ally series, Lenovo Legion Go series, AYANEO 2S/3, MSI Claw, or most other handheld gaming systems. The Xreal One series is so good because it's the first set of smart display glasses with a custom chipset built in, which creates a fully tracked virtual screen in front of your face.</p><p>Here's what that means. When you plug most smart glasses into a Steam Deck, for instance, the screen that appears in front of your eyes follows your eyes at all times. If you move your head around, that screen never leaves your center of vision. While this is OK for sitting on the couch or lying in bed, it can be a little nauseating to some people in a moving vehicle.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fh64sAMLb3VwsWE7sKeSvC" name="viture-mobile-dock-nintendo-switch-adapter" alt="The Steam Deck adapter for the Viture One Mobile Dock and Viture Pro Mobile Dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fh64sAMLb3VwsWE7sKeSvC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GHuFQBMqmQ7LBugJYfFnxC" name="viture-one-mobile-dock-steam-deck-back" alt="The Steam Deck adapter for the Viture One Mobile Dock and Viture Pro Mobile Dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHuFQBMqmQ7LBugJYfFnxC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rv3byBWtMSLhUDE9bpvArJ" name="steam-deck-viture-one-glasses.jpg" alt="Using Viture One glasses with a Steam Deck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rv3byBWtMSLhUDE9bpvArJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>With Xreal One, the virtual screen is pinned in 3D space, much like a TV is mounted to a wall. If you move your head around, the screen stays where it's supposed to, no matter where you're looking. If you prefer it to stay pinned to the center of your vision, a quick tap of the side button will cycle between display modes, so you can choose what works best for the situation you're in.</p><p>Xreal One also includes a bevy of additional calibration tools and options built into the glasses that can be toggled via the buttons on the underside of each arm. In every way you can imagine, they feel like a proper "monitor for your face," including all those extra options you find in a monitor's settings menu. Other smart glasses require separate hardware or software to do anything similar, and most don't offer the same options even with those extras.</p><p>The only reason I would recommend other glasses at this point in time is if you have a specific need. RayNeo Air 3S offers 3840Hz PWM dimming as an excellent eye care solution, so if Xreal Ones give you a headache, RayNeo Air 3S is likely the alternative you need. You can also use a Viture One Mobile Dock or Viture Pro Mobile Dock with the Steam Deck, which will allow you to play the system and charge at the same time. If you do this, I recommend grabbing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.viture.com/product/mobile-dock-mount-for-steam-deck">Steam Deck mount</a> for the dock.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-glasses-for-your-phone-tablet-or-computer"><span>Best smart glasses for your phone, tablet, or computer</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sPSFaW7UBUS4RV2J7XWSeA" name="xreal-one-wearing-01" alt="Wearing a pair of Xreal One smart glasses while working on a laptop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sPSFaW7UBUS4RV2J7XWSeA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal One and Xreal One Pro are still the best choice for these platforms since they provide a tracked screen that's best for plug-and-play. But it's worth noting that companies like Viture and RayNeo offer software suites on smart devices that deliver additional functionality over the normal plug-and-play experience. Xreal also has an app called Nebula, but I wouldn't recommend using it at all.</p><p>It's important to know about these because, even if your glasses don't offer native 3DoF window tracking like Xreal Ones do out of the box, an extra app can allow your computer, phone, or tablet to do all the computing needed to make that happen.</p><p>I wouldn't say most of this software is user-friendly — especially not on the PC/Mac side of things — but smartphone apps are much more straightforward.

Between the two, I would recommend SpaceWalker, as it not only has a lot more development time behind it, but the UI is more straightforward, and it supports <em>a lot</em> more platforms.</p><p>But if you're just looking for a simple plug-and-play experience, stick with Xreal One.</p><h2 id="even-more-smart-glasses-are-around-the-corner-2">Even more smart glasses are around the corner</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn" name="android-xr-xreal-glasses-reflection" alt="The Android XR logo reflected in the left lens of a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Smart glasses are booming right now, and the industry isn't slowing down anytime soon.

However, smart glasses like Ray-Ban Meta and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-and-metas-new-smart-glasses-are-built-for-athletes-and-they-look-insane" target="_blank">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> (pronounced "how-stuhn") have several additional factors to consider, including camera quality, battery life, charging speed, and more.</p><p>While Oakley Meta HSTN is a clear evolution over what made Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses so great, there's a clear price difference between the two models. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/level-up-your-tech-game-with-20-percent-off-these-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">gone on sale a lot recently</a>, with prices dipping down to around $240 for a pair. Meanwhile, Oakley Meta HSTN launches on July 11 for $399, while some style choices will cost you $499. That's a big price gap!</p><p>But are the Oakley glasses worth the cost? Designer brands are often more expensive just because of a name, but Oakley Meta HSTN does a good job of providing extra value for a higher price.

Oakley Meta HSTN only ships in four main colors, too: Black, Warm Grey, Clear, and Brown Smoke. With each of these frame colors, you can choose from six different lens colors: Warm Grey, Clear, Grey Transitions, Ruby, PRIZM Polar Deep Water, or PRISM Polar Black.</p><p>Based on this, you can guess that Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses are <em>the</em> choice for folks who want a range of styles and colors to select from. However, as I mentioned earlier, this choice isn't <em>just </em>about style. It's about function, too.</p><p>While Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses offer more style and color options, Oakley Meta HSTN are designed to be a sportier, more performance-focused pair of smart glasses. Meta even states this in the "How to choose" section of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/">AI Glasses product page</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YKyZFwoLkHfXYQ7yTA5UM9" name="oakley-meta-hstn-all-colors" alt="All available colors of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YKyZFwoLkHfXYQ7yTA5UM9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">All available Oakley Meta HSTN colors and styles </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regardless of which model, style, or color you choose, all Meta AI glasses ship with a single camera on one side of the front of the frame and a privacy LED on the opposite side. They also include over-the-ear speakers built into the glasses' arms, a battery that lasts several hours, and can be recharged via the included storage case.</p><p>That storage case works just like an earbud case works, so you'll charge the battery in the case by plugging a USB-C cable into its port. You'll then dock the glasses inside the carrying case any time they need a top-up, and the case's battery will give your glasses several full charges before needing to be topped up again.</p><p>Either way, when you buy a pair of Meta AI glasses, you're getting a pair of frames that look like glasses, not a tech gadget that just so happens to be on your face.</p><h2 id="oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-vs-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-cameras-and-battery-life-2">Oakley Meta HSTN glasses vs. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: Cameras and battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PU27DsF3iLwKhPZjTMAVNf" name="oakley-meta-hstn-official-render-white-camera-01" alt="An official product render of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PU27DsF3iLwKhPZjTMAVNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we don't know the battery size of Oakley Meta HSTN yet, we know that Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses use a 154mAh battery.

Oakley Meta HSTN glasses weigh 53g, indicating that they have a larger battery than Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, but certainly not double the capacity, unless Meta switched battery technology.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And while both glasses feature just one 12MP camera on the front, Oakley Meta HSTN are able to record at 3K resolution while Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses are restricted to 1080p.</p><p>That extra boost in video recording resolution is thanks mainly to a new camera sensor, which should also take higher quality photos, even if they're in the same resolution.

Oakley's trademark PRISM Polar lenses provide a unique look through the glasses when compared to Ray-Ban's offerings, but you'll pay at least $100 more for Oakley's enhanced capabilities.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses offer a significant number of additional style choices over Oakley and are less expensive, to boot. There's no known software feature differentiation between Oakley and Ray-Ban, though, so you're mainly choosing between style, performance, and cost.</p><p>If I had to pick one to buy today, I'd still choose Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses because of the style options and the value, but there's no denying that Oakley Meta HSTN are more capable glasses that help solve the biggest issue of all: battery life.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="76e79cd8-f9a6-4aa3-b82d-1d64e2b3a357">            <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/" data-model-name="Oakley Meta HSTN" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZRdrhc9epKCVuFe6gCHxd5.jpg' alt="The Oakley Meta HSTN glasses"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are the next evolution in Meta's lineup of smart glasses, featuring more frame styles, more lens options, much better battery life, faster charging, and authentic Oakley looks.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4be7e7a1-8b29-4a1f-9ea7-cc4981779e6c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xPc8eyrKGnph3TrfkCWp8S.jpg' alt="An official product render of Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses in Wayfarer style"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have been a staple of the industry for nearly two nears now, pushing glasses-based AI to new fronts and making photo and video capture easier than ever.

Early on, Google highlighted a few pre-made options users would find, like a Career guide, Writing editor, and Coding partner Gem. Each of these can walk users through the process, elevating their writing with proper grammar/structure, or learning about their aspirations to find the right career for them.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The leak features a trio of images, each showcasing different aspects of the phone straight out of its assumed packaging. The major change, which is what's got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/lakshyalark/status/1940740551537840164">everyone chatting on X</a>, is with the phone's cameras. The leak suggests the phone has dropped the black rings, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">the Fold 6</a> featured, as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>Instead, it seems the phone will sport shimmering, silver rings around its camera lenses, which certainly gives it a bit of pop. The phone's cameras are still sitting atop an island, which makes its array stand out.</p><p>The cover and internal displays remain covered; however, the leaked imagery turns the device flat, showing off Samsung's continued thin era. While it's hard to get an exact estimation, it <em>seems </em>like the Fold 7 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review#:~:text=SAMSUNG%20GALAXY%20Z%20FOLD%206%3A%20DESIGN%20AND%20DISPLAYS">much thinner than the Fold 6</a>. The phone's SIM tray takes up all the space available, in contrast to the bit of wiggle room it had on the Fold 6.</p><h2 id="the-fold-is-coming-2">The Fold is Coming</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Z Fold 7 pic.twitter.com/h8EhC7LbTP<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1940641079948378581">July 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 allegedly leaked back in June <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-alleged-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-leak-ahead-of-rumored-launch">in some renders</a>. As we've been hearing for a while, Samsung seems to have inched toward a much thinner, sleeker Fold 7 compared to its previous editions. The latest rumors claim the device is roughly 215 grams, around 24 grams lighter than the Fold 6. Even when closed in the renders, the device <em>appears </em>thinner than before.</p><p>Just how thin isn't confirmed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-might-be-gunning-for-the-crown-as-the-worlds-thinnest-foldable">but rumors say</a> the Fold 7 could measure 8.9mm when folded. When opened, this could come out to 3.9mm. Other whispers claim the phone won't see a battery upgrade, as it might still rock a 4,400mAh battery setup.</p><p>Another aspect we've kept our eyes on is pricing. Considering the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-court-trump-recent-tariffs-halted-illegal-ieepa">changes to tariffs</a>, it may leave some potential Samsung consumers concerned over the next Fold, but there <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-suggests-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-galaxy-z-flip-7-wont-see-a-price-hike">might be some good news</a>. Some rumors state Samsung might launch the Fold 7 at around $1,899, which is similar to its 2024 model. The Flip 7 might also stick around the same area at $1,099. These prices regard "most markets," but the U.S. could be stuck with a major 30-40% increase.</p><p>We won't have to remain in speculation for much longer, as Samsung is gearing up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-july-unpacked">Unpacked on July 9</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

However, as the post notes, Samsung's internal code refers to the device as the "Multifold 7," which is speculated to be a codename. The more substantial pieces of evidence regard support animations for the phone's functions. One animation shows off the trifold's folding process, which sees the left-most portion opening, revealing its full display.</p><p>The tipster went further, stating that One UI 8's animation suggests Samsung has gone with two "inward-folding" panels. However, the software's animations warn that both foldable panels aren't created equal.</p><p>It appears that the two hinges, for the left and right panels, are different sizes. The former is seemingly much smaller, meaning that it needs to be folded first. This theory is backed up by One UI 8's warning animation that says users should not fold the panel with the camera array first when closing.</p><p>As the tipster assumes, this warning is in place to likely avoid breaking that left panel.</p><h2 id="hinting-at-design-2">Hinting at Design</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.96%;"><img id="EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-snapshot" alt="Samsung's expected tri-fold's rear panels, as leaked in a One UI 8 animation, showing a triple rear camera array and its cover display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="896" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:816px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.53%;"><img id="LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-front-display-leak" alt="A leaked snapshot of Samsung's tri-fold's internal display from a One UI 8 animation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="816" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Aside from the support animation's detailing precautions, they might've also hinted at the phone's design. The tipster's evidence suggests Samsung's "G Fold" (or whatever it may be called) will see a design similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 7. The right-most panel seems to house the vertical, triple camera array, which looks similar to what we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">on the Z Fold 6</a>. The lenses appear raised onto a pill-shaped island, and the rings may also sport those thick black rings, too.</p><p>The center panel will house the phone's cover display and centered selfie camera, leaving the final panel empty. Additionally, it seems Samsung will place its internal display's selfie camera on the far right side when in use.</p><p>We've been on this Samsung tri-fold train ever since it dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">a not-so-subtle teaser about it</a> during Unpacked. Listed amongst its Android XR and other foldable illustrations was a tri-fold device. We're all aware of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally">Huawei's Mate XT surprise</a>, and it seems Samsung wanted in. There were rumors that Samsung could provide its version with a 9.9/10-inch internal display when completely unfolded.</p><p>A<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-tri-fold-phone-tipped-to-get-unveiled-at-july-unpacked-event"> more recent rumor</a> suggests next week's Unpacked event could host the phone's full reveal. However, there's a chance consumers won't get their hands on it until the fall. More importantly, speculation states Samsung might only make a limited number of G Fold phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-g-fold-could-come-sooner-than-you-expect">starting around 200,000 units</a>.</p><p>Regardless, Samsung is preparing for its summer Unpacked event, where we're expecting to see the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Fold 7.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

We could even get "personalized nutrition advice" with "tailored meal plans and recipes."</p><p>In theory, this all sounds like a holistic approach to health that'll make Samsung Health better, backed by algorithmic data, accurate sensors, and LLM-generated advice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="fvQsBhstA3e9ve4iwvA5yQ" name="One-UI-8-Bedtime-Guidance" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fvQsBhstA3e9ve4iwvA5yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In practice, people might turn off bedtime reminders for the same reason they turn off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">move reminders</a>: to avoid being shamed. Samsung's Running Coach will need to live up to the accuracy of a fitness watch's lactate threshold test for serious runners to care about their score; up until now, Samsung's VO2 Max score has never felt especially accurate.</p><p>And after the mess last year with everyone getting the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">AGEs Index</a>, I'm curious whether the antioxidant index tool will detect carotenoids with precision.</p><p>I'm not trying to be cynical here. But accuracy and personalization matter as much as presentation. Will Samsung be able to accurately judge a person's heart health, or create a competent marathon training plan based on 12 minutes of running data? And will its AI coach provide <em>specific</em> advice or just spit out generalizations from Google Search?</p><p>That's why Gemini — running in the background to power these Galaxy AI tools — matters so much to the Watch 8's success. Samsung needs to convince people these tools aren't AI boondoggles with iffy data, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus</a> chatbot.

The blog post promised "hands-free assistance using natural voice commands to stay productive on the move." It gave examples like "Remember I’m using locker 43 today" or "Summarize my last email" of what Gemini can do, pulling data from Google and Samsung apps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xK8nsr8pYWNm2VTN2yRKK6" name="Pixel-Watch-Material-3-Expressive" alt="A Pixel Watch showing the Gemini prompt for a "10 minute mile run playlist" on YouTube Music, with a Playlist button underneath it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xK8nsr8pYWNm2VTN2yRKK6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Pixel Watch showing the Gemini prompt for a "10 minute mile run playlist" on YouTube Music, with a Playlist button underneath it. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This sounds futuristic as heck and could wow people who rely on basic Assistant commands (or Siri). But it will come down to execution.</p><p>How well will Gemini recognize commands specific to watches and watch apps? Will commands be effective outside of the core Samsung and Google apps? Will Gemini use more battery life than Assistant did? Can you use Gemini Live on your watch?</p><p>Most importantly, will the newer Galaxy Watches have any advanced, on-device Gemini smarts with the newest Exynos chips, or is it all dependent upon your Galaxy phone? People need a reason to upgrade from their old Galaxy Watch, or <em>not</em> to buy the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7</a> for significantly less.</p><p>I'm also curious if Google is holding anything back with Gemini for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, leaving the Galaxy Watch 8 waiting a couple of months longer for this killer feature. Thankfully, we'll find out soon what Samsung and Google have up their metaphorical sleeves! Hopefully, it's enough to get the AI-obsessed public interested in their watches again.</p><p>But if Gemini on Wear OS is a pedestrian upgrade over Assistant, people will keep migrating to other brands that offer better battery life, advanced fitness training, or other perks.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, users will soon notice new listening controls on mobile. These controls will be placed at the top of the playlist, so users can "steer the vibe of their discovery."</p><p>The post says that users can "choose up to five genres," which are already personalized based on your listening history. When chosen, Discover Weekly will provide a brand new selection of 30 songs.</p><p>These updates are rolling out for Premium users this week.</p><p>The celebrations continue as Spotify takes a look back at 10 years of Discover Weekly. Designed to bring users music they might like to listen to, users have streamed over 100 billion tracks in Discover Weekly. This huge number has some special modifiers, according to Spotify. Discover Weekly has enabled listeners to discover more than 56 million new artists per week (average). Additionally, in just one year, Spotify says users saved over 556 million songs found through Discover Weekly.</p><p>Also, Discover Weekly appears to have helped new artists find more ears.

I currently don't have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a>. And while I can't prove all the things that OnePlus is alleged to be doing, I can still tell you that this is probably true. Then again, it's also true that the phone I am using (a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>) is doing the exact same thing, collecting the same types of "sensitive personal information," and shipping it off to be stored on a server somewhere. Your phone is doing the same thing.</p><p>They all do it, and we <strong>did</strong> agree to it in those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/read-the-fine-print">terms we never read</a>.</p><h2 id="fear-or-posturing-2">Fear or posturing?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xETYDcczKYm6H3hrKeAEXW" name="oneplus-13-alert-slider" alt="The alert slider on the side of the blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xETYDcczKYm6H3hrKeAEXW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Normally, I try to stay out of politics and the constant fighting that goes along with it. It never works, and people think that one side is "their guy" and the other side isn't. To me, it's class warfare of the wealthy versus the rest of us.</p><p>China has been the hot button for a while. The last U.S. administration <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">didn't like it any better</a> than the current one. China is legitimately becoming an economic powerhouse that threatens the United States, and nobody who might get blamed for it likes it very much.</p><p>We've seen Chinese companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-losing-access-android-updates-google-support-after-trump-trade-ban">blacklisted and banned</a>, we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/biden-administration-reverses-xiaomis-us-trading-ban">threats of the same</a> for others. These companies aren't doing anything different than the companies that aren't on the chopping block; they just contribute to the Chinese economy in ways that Google or Apple do not.</p><p>In this case, OnePlus is collecting the same type of data that any other phone is collecting and likely sending it off to servers in France or Iowa or somewhere. These servers are likely administered by people who work for or with OnePlus, a Shenzhen-based phone maker.</p><p>Someone in China likely has access to that data regardless of where the server lives. And yes, we checked and have seen no indication that the data goes directly to China.</p><p>We also reached out to OnePlus about the allegations, but we have yet to hear back at the time of publication.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1181px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:23.96%;"><img id="rNqzR5KdEpoW2fg7fWSSoW" name="OnePlus-wireshark" alt="OnePlus data destinations via Wireshark, with traffic from ByteDance's CapCut software highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rNqzR5KdEpoW2fg7fWSSoW.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1181" height="283" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A table showing OnePlus data destinations, via Wireshark. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus isn't likely to do anything out of the ordinary with this data. That doesn't mean the ordinary is good — big tech companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-google-collect-too-much-our-personal-info">collect far too much personal information</a> whenever we allow them to do it.</p><p>The user data also isn't going directly to some sort of secret communist Chinese spy agency. It's just being collected so OnePlus can try to sell you more stuff or build a better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-get-ai-powered-suggested-replies-for-messaging">AI-powered piece of software</a>. Again, just like Amazon or Meta does.</p><p>The current administration likes to say they are tough on China. They don't mean the people of China; they mean the government and the companies it uses to bolster the Chinese presence on the world stage.</p><p>If OnePlus were based in Oklahoma or even Saskatchewan, nobody would bat an eye about it collecting the same amount and types of data that everyone else does. The one thing the government needs to do is protect us, and giving a free pass to a company that isn't contributing to the new bad guy on the block isn't doing it. If it's bad when OnePlus is doing it, it's also bad when Samsung does it.</p><p>But I digress. In a few years, we get to elect another set of politicians who will do the same thing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I just got started with the smart lock, and it does everything I need in a retrofit solution — it's convenient to install, connects to every smart home protocol, and has a modern design that doesn't look tacky in the least.</p><p>Nuki is a European brand, and it is now making its debut in the U.S. with the Smart Lock. The local is designed to be installed over existing single-cylinder deadbolts, and it has Matter integration alongside Apple Home, Google Home, Alexa, SmartThings, and Home Assistant. Basically, you can control the lock with just about any smart home standard you use.</p><p>Interestingly, the Smart Lock <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7HKRWNV">costs just $159 on Amazon U.S.</a>; this is a different model to the Smart Lock Pro that sells for €269 ($317) in European countries. Both models use Nuki's new brushless motor and have Matter over Thread integration, but the Pro includes adjustable speed modes, has a sleeker design, and comes with free access the app.</p><p>The U.S. model, meanwhile, needs a $5.90 monthly Nuki Premium subscription to unlock remote access and additional features. That said, if you activate the Smart Lock in the U.S. before September 30, you get lifetime access to Nuki Premium without any additional cost.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mcZnbjV4WN5CxShcBRWEaW" name="Nuki Smart Lock" alt="Nuki Smart Lock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mcZnbjV4WN5CxShcBRWEaW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll share a detailed review of the smart lock in the coming weeks, but the key takeaway is that the Smart Lock is incredibly easy to use, has extensive customizability, and the built-in battery is designed to last six months between charges. The lock itself has a custom magnetic connector, but the other end has a standard USB-C port, and I charged it with a power bank without any issues.</p><p>Nuki's app is easily one of the best around, and it has an extensive feature-set. Honestly, it's great to use a smart home product with sensible privacy controls and easy customizability, and Nuki did all the right things in this area. The Smart Lock is a great addition to this category, and if you're interested in a retrofit solution, I recommend buying it before September 30 so you can get free access to Nuki Premium.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="01d2f185-b238-4c9a-bf3b-2f7d32772c02">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7HKRWNV" data-model-name="Nuki Smart Lock" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:83.07%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7iHSkgWNwPGMzAuVDSbMeK.jpg' alt="Nuki Smart Lock"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nuki Smart Lock</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Nuki's Smart Lock combines an elegant design with class-leading security and connectivity. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Your debit card, NFC tag, or sticker does not have its own power source, though.</p><p>Except that it does when it needs it!</p><p>NFC works kind of the same way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">wireless chargers</a> work. Using an induced magnetic field, a passive device has enough power to send the data it contains. Here's a simplified step-by-step.</p><p><strong>NFC tags don't have power:</strong> NFC tags are passive and don't have their own power supply, battery, or need to be plugged into the wall. They're a microchip with data imprinted on it.</p><p><strong>The reader induces the power: </strong>An NFC reader, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a>, can read the data stored on the NFC tag <em><strong>and</strong></em> has a battery. When it gets in range of the proper tag, it releases an alternating magnetic field — it "pulses" energy at a specific frequency and range.</p><p><strong>The tag leeches the power.</strong> When an NFC sender like a tag gets within range of this magnetic field, a small electrical current is induced. The physics of how it does this is pretty complicated, but the practical side means that the NFC tag's antenna now has just enough power to transmit its data.</p><p>Because of how it works, NFC has a short range. This is actually beneficial because it means that only the intended two devices communicate. You wouldn't want the cash register reading your card to pay for whatever the person in front of you is buying.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="V3ZijrAf6pU6CxYQE9hVgn" name="Inside-jerrys-pockets-5.jpg" alt="Xperia NFC tag" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V3ZijrAf6pU6CxYQE9hVgn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>You can manipulate the frequency of the magnetic field from the reader to change the range, which is what the NFC Forum has done with Release 15. Because the range is spherical (extending in all directions), it means the tag's antenna is powered without the alignment being critical; your phone can pay for your smoothie without being in the perfect spot.</p><p>If you've ever tried to buy a Coke from a vending machine using NFC while your hands were full, you know how important this is.</p><p>NFC uses the principle that the tag is simply a small antenna that can harvest the energy it needs to send the data it holds. Software on the device that is doing the reading, like a phone or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">a watch</a>, initiates this transfer and decides what to do with the data.</p><p>NFC tags are used for payments, but also have plenty of other applications. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-fast-pair-headphones-chromebooks">pair Bluetooth devices using NFC</a> or even unlock the door of your hotel room with a tag embedded inside a keycard.</p><p>It's pretty cool technology that we usually never think about.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The periscope lens has been provided with an AI Super Telephoto feature, which drives its zoom from 3x to 100x.</p><p>Honor claims that even at its maximum zoom, the Magic V5's periscope lens will capture clear and detailed photos.

The phone features a 6,100mAh battery that's paired with 66W wired fast-charging support. Additionally, consumers can pair this with its 50W wireless charging capabilities.</p><h2 id="yoyo-ai-stands-tall-2">YOYO AI stands tall</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1194px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.25%;"><img id="d9PfD2mZEvFfcchWM9pvVP" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-launch-yoyo-assistant" alt="Honor's YOYO AI assistant can help users "with anything" they need." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d9PfD2mZEvFfcchWM9pvVP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1194" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YOYO, Honor's AI assistant on its phones, is available in full on the Magic V5. The company states the AI is capable of helping consumers "with everything." For one, YOYO is fully integrated with DeepSeek AI to help users get through robust articles, "physical examination reports," and financial statements. Moreover, YOYO can even "remember" important dates from a document you're currently reading.</p><p>Multitasking has also been improved, with YOYO assisting users when opening up multiple apps at once. What's more, Honor states YOYO can help rediscover files on your phone even if you can't remember what it's called. All users need to do is describe the file as best as possible, and let YOYO do the rest.</p><p>Currently for launch, the foldable rocks MagicOS 9.0.1, a skin atop Android 15. Consumers overseas in China will find the device available in the following RAM/storage configs: 12/256GB, 16/512GB, and 16/1TB.</p><p>We want our phones to look good, too, so the Magic V5 is available in Dawn Gold, Warm White, Silk Road, and Velvet Black. Chinese consumers will find the device's pre-orders active for purchase.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Google focused on rolling out a more "intuitive" UI update for Photos app users when looking back at their memories. To begin, Google Photos will now display "glanceable" date, time, and location information above a photo. The post states this should "make it easier to pinpoint" when and where the image was taken.</p><p>However, the location part of it is something users will need to have active for it to work.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:607px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.85%;"><img id="Nytii2pr9oGgo3bw7HuHQ8" name="google-photos-redesign-ios-update-action-menu" alt="Google Photos update for its photo view places a handful of useful options into its revamped three-dot action menu." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nytii2pr9oGgo3bw7HuHQ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="607" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, the Photos update is reworking its actions menu. Google says these improvements should help with its "usability and navigation." Via the three-dot menu when viewing a photo, users will find actions like Google Lens, Create, Cast, and more. Other important actions that users might need are listed at the bottom of the photo view UI.</p><p>Lastly, Google is bringing in Light Mode. It adds that Photos will switch up its theme (dark and light) based on your device's set preference.</p><p>When it comes to viewing photo stacks or bursts, Google Photos will display a small three-dot menu beside its thumbnail at the bottom of the UI. From there, the post says users will find options to change the stack's top photo, remove an image from the stack, unstack, and a multi-select option.</p><p>Rounding out the update are Google Photos' new badges in photo view.</p><h2 id="recent-happenings-in-google-photos-2">Recent Happenings in Google Photos</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:178.04%;"><img id="o8r9zG6k4RdZoayC6Pqic4" name="google-photos-photo-view-badges" alt="Google Photos now displays useful badges for live photos, backups, and more in photo view on iOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8r9zG6k4RdZoayC6Pqic4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="337" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These badges are said to give users a little more utility right from the view screen. Live photos can be played or paused via a new badge at the top. Additionally, users can change a photo's category, save a shared photo, or backup a picture.</p><p>Google states these updates are already available on iOS; however, the same package is "coming soon" for Android.</p><p>In May, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-10-year-celebration-updates">Google Photos turned 10</a>, and with it came two major updates for the app. The in-app photo editor received a refresh, bringing AI-powered suggestions. Google said its AI suggestions will combine several of the app's built-in editing tools, so users need only tap once to apply the changes for a spruced-up photo. However, users still have the option of tapping individual parts of their photo to edit those specifically.</p><p>Additionally, the Photos app supports QR codes for albums, so you can share them more easily.</p><p>Another update saw Google upgrade Photos' old HDR effect with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-now-lets-you-spice-up-your-pictures-with-ultra-hdr-glow">a better Ultra HDR version</a>.

The publication expands on this, citing an alleged industry official who states, "Technological advancement does not necessarily guarantee sales, so the company seems to be taking a careful approach in positioning Ballie."</p><p>Supposedly, Samsung has become "cautious" about Ballie, opting to take more time to reconsider its "defining" role within a smart home. The publication highlights Ballie's features, like its powerful chips, high-res projector, and sensors to assist with daily home life. With all of this, there's speculation that Ballie could run up the cost to ~$2,000.</p><p>It seems that there's concern that Ballie isn't going to offer <em>enough </em>to consumers to warrant such a high (speculated) price point. On top of that, there are questions about whether or not its features will offer anything new and interesting that consumers can't get from their phone or other smart home devices.</p><p>The publication states that there are still many questions left unanswered about Ballie and its services in a home. It adds that Samsung itself has not officially stated the cause for its AI companion's delay.</p><h2 id="it-s-been-five-years-2">It's been five years...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hGxL9HRRceBit4bv76dS6" name="samsung-ballie-floor-hero" alt="Samsung's Ballie AI robot sitting on the floor as its user talks to it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hGxL9HRRceBit4bv76dS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's take a moment to remember that Samsung first showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-ces-2020">Ballie five years ago during CES 2020</a>. To sum it up, Ballie was positioned as a new Samsung robot companion for homes. Packaged inside a cute little yellow ball on wheels, Ballie was teased to be Samsung's human-centric vision toward robots. Its tagline about Ballie said that it "understands you, supports you, and reacts to your needs" in an early promo run.</p><p>Ballie's early showing even detailed its built-in camera, which would let homeowners tap into their app and see their home through the AI's "eye."</p><p>Fast forward to 2025 (January, specifically), and we're met with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-phone-subscription-club-service-detailed">surprising announcement</a> from Samsung's vice chairman, Han Jong-hee. Han stated Ballie was gearing up for a U.S. and South Korean launch this year during its "first half." However, that didn't come to pass. Samsung even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-samsung-ballie-personal-insights-summer-details">announced its huge Google Cloud partnership</a>, which brings Gemini to Ballie.</p><p>The Korean OEM highlighted multimodal reasoning capabilities for Ballie, thanks to Gemini. Essentially, this software would make Ballie more "proactive" for whatever home task it's been given. Ballie can also help users pick out something to wear (fashion), health and wellness inquiries, and much more.</p><p>Considering we've just moved past the first half of 2025, it seems we are waiting for Ballie once again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It&apos;s too soon to say, but you can at least expect Samsung to announce some preorder deals when the devices are unveiled. Of course, I&apos;ll update this guide as soon as I learn more. </p><h2 id="how-do-i-find-the-best-samsung-galaxy-deals-during-prime-day-2">How do I find the best Samsung Galaxy deals during Prime Day?</h2><p>Prime Day may be Amazon&apos;s thing, but they&apos;re far from the only retailer launching a major sale event next week. If you&apos;re trying to find the best Galaxy deals during the sale, start by checking Amazon&apos;s listings before comparing prices with competing retailers, such as Best Buy and Walmart. You should also see if your wireless carrier is running a special promotion that&apos;ll work for you, and of course, always check Samsung.com before committing to one single deal. </p><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out our </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>!</strong></em></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

E Ink is often lauded as the most eye-friendly type of display available, and while it certainly looks and feels a lot more natural than a traditional display, companies like TCL are attempting to bridge the gap between E Ink's readability and a traditional display's smoothness.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>With the launch of the NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet at the end of June, TCL is ushering in a new era of display technology with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">NXTPAPER 4.0</a>, the next-generation entry into TCL's fascinating ePaper technology. NXTPAPER 4.0 is brighter, more color-accurate, and features a slew of new eye-friendly enhancements that set a new standard for LCD technology.</p><p>Like previous NXTPAPER devices, the NXTPAPER 11 Plus features a protective layer on top of the display that's not only matte — similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-display-review">Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra display</a> — but it's got a paperlike texture underneath to simulate a more natural appearance. It also features three separate color modes that can be used to best recreate a paper-like experience: regular mode, color paper mode, and ink paper mode, all with a tap of the new NXTPAPER key at the top of the tablet.</p><p>Even better, the tablet is dirt-cheap, retailing for just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/TCL-NXTPAPER-11-Plus/14687819013">$249 at Walmart</a>. The U.S. version doesn't ship with a stylus, but it's available as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/products/mobile/accessories/t-pen-stylus">$39 add-on</a> if you want it. Now, if we could just get more of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcls-60-series-phones-pack-premium-features-without-the-high-end-price">TCL 60 series</a> in the U.S. with NXTPAPER 4.0 displays, things would be really good.</p><h2 id="the-colors-duke-2">The colors, Duke</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uYYTHa6oHbfPj47EKR3Fgn" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-shonen-jump" alt="A TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet with the Shonen Jump app on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uYYTHa6oHbfPj47EKR3Fgn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I deeply appreciate the paper-like appearance of the imagery presented on the 11-inch tablet's screen, it's the enhanced color accuracy that makes the biggest difference for sensitive eyes. It's not because more accurate colors inherently mean a display is more comfortable. Rather, a display that can naturally display more colors is best because it doesn't have to <em>fake it</em> to make it.</p><p>A non-insignificant number of modern displays use what's called color dithering to make the display appear higher quality than it actually is. This clever engineering trick flashes a pixel quickly back and forth between two colors, making your eyes see a color that doesn't actually exist. The problem is that, like with PWM dimming, any sort of quick flickering like this can give users splitting headaches (or worse).</p><p>TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 and earlier used color dithering because the technology wasn't capable of displaying 8-bit or 10-bit color naturally, but NXTPAPER 4.0 changes that. In regular color mode, you can disable all the NXTVISION features in display settings, fully removing all color dithering in my tests.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jcRRpPEA78Q" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>I measure this by hooking a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> up to an inexpensive smartphone microscope that I picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Carson-Microscope-Smartphone-Digiscoping-MP-250/dp/B015MS8O48/">on Amazon for $20</a>. I use this phone specifically because it's able to use 480FPS slow motion, while most flagships (iPhone, Galaxy, and Pixel) top out at 240FPS.</p><p>I then pull up several different images and hold the microscope up to the display for a moment to capture any potential pixel movement. My tests include a rainbow gradient, a grayscale gradient, three different gray images set to 25%, 50%, and 75%, plus a look at the edges of text and icons on the home screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NB32RD7kUx3yVE62yr8Agn" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-nxtpaper-specs" alt="A TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet with its specs on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NB32RD7kUx3yVE62yr8Agn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most common place you'll find dithering is around the edges of icons and text, as well as on grays 50% and darker. In regular mode, the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus didn't show any signs of dithering, something flicker-sensitive users have been begging for in an era when display and phone manufacturers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">entirely ignore science</a> and opt for more vibrant displays instead of prioritizing the long-term health of their users.</p><p>Unfortunately, NXTPAPER's two additional display modes, color paper and ink paper, both use dithering to achieve their unique visual effects. Users who aren't sensitive to dithering — which, thankfully, seems to be more people than not — will enjoy these other two modes for different kinds of content.</p><h2 id="matte-for-the-win-2">Matte for the win</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4968px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="j3WmYFwrd9haozqRrFUGNT" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-vs-bigme-b1051c-pro-vs-daylight-computer" alt="Comparing outdoor viewability between the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus, the Bigme B1051C Pro, and the Daylight Computer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j3WmYFwrd9haozqRrFUGNT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4968" height="2795" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Adding a special matte layer on top of a display is one of the things that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best E Ink tablets</a> such a joy to read on, and it's one of the reasons NXTPAPER looks as nice as it does, too.</p><p>Matte layers cut down on reflections and both make it easier to see the display in any light, plus help diffuse the light in a way that's generally considered easier on the eyes. In fact, these layers are often so diffusive that you can't see the individual pixels under the matte layer, even with a microscope.</p><p>NXTPAPER has, as you might expect, the most paper-like diffusion layer. It has a texture that resembles plant fibers, as you'd expect to see when viewing a piece of paper under a microscope.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QNnDtfhG5Gk3UtmtceXbam" name="nxtpaper-4-vs-rlcd-vs-color-e-ink-vs-lcd" alt="Comparing the visibility of subpixels and matte diffusion layers between NXTPAPER 4.0, Color E Ink, RLCD, and standard LCD displays" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QNnDtfhG5Gk3UtmtceXbam.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="sn9iYZApDKAz88N4BM2hcJ" name="nxtpaper-4-vs-white-paper" alt="Comparing the visible texture of different types of displays compared to a piece of paper under a microscope, including NXTPAPER 4.0, RLCD, and color E Ink" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sn9iYZApDKAz88N4BM2hcJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>In the image above, I compared the NXTPAPER 11 Plus with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/move-over-kindle-this-display-solves-e-inks-biggest-problem">Daylight Computer</a>, which uses a reflective black & white LCD display, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions">Bigme B1051C Pro</a>, which uses a color E Ink Kaleido 3 display, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, which uses a standard LCD screen, and a good old fashioned piece of paper.</p><p>The Pixel Tablet's glossy screen is representative of all traditional displays. Whether it's LCD, OLED, micro-LED, or something else entirely, all of these displays see you staring straight at a collection of millions of pixels that are typically made up of red, green, and blue subpixels.</p><p>Not only does the diffusion layer help cut down on the eye strain that comes with staring directly at a light source, but it also provides an appearance that looks more like natural fibers. That means reading a web page or even watching a video makes the display look and feel more like looking at them on the pages of a book.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zPXHKMLVfBUcB2u2g7GhMT" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-vs-google-pixel-tablet-outdoor-viewability" alt="Comparing outdoor viewability between the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus's matte screen and the Google Pixel Tablet's glossy screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPXHKMLVfBUcB2u2g7GhMT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem with a traditional matte layer like this is that it significantly reduces the perceived brightness. While it's impossible to see how bright this display <em>could</em> have been without the matte layer, my light meter tells me that it tops out at around 500 nits. That's <em>a lot</em> lower than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>'s outdoor brightness, which tops out at around 2,000 nits.</p><p>TCL could circumvent this by allowing the display to accept natural light, similar to how E Ink and RLCD work, but that would require significant re-engineering. TCL doesn't advertise this as an outdoor-friendly display anyway, though, so this wouldn't be necessary unless the company is planning to branch out.</p><p>I also found that the display's minimum brightness was still too bright for my liking, something that was pretty easily fixed by enabling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-adjust-brightness-android-phone">Extra Dim</a> accessibility setting. Thankfully, the NXTPAPER 11 Plus doesn't use PWM dimming at all, so dropping the brightness isn't detrimental to my eyeballs. This is a true DC-dimmed LCD panel and features no flickering at all when using standard color mode.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4968px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="N2TJ6FUEkUfiZH36u48sGT" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-vs-bigme-b1051c-pro-vs-daylight-computer-02" alt="Comparing outdoor viewability between the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus, the Bigme B1051C Pro, and the Daylight Computer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2TJ6FUEkUfiZH36u48sGT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4968" height="2795" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The viewing angles could also use a lot of work. NXTPAPER's unique structure makes this challenging to solve, but given TCL's display expertise and the significant advancements this technology has made in a few short years, I'm confident they'll be able to solve it in the future.</p><p>If you plan to do a lot of outdoor reading, E Ink tablets from companies like Bigme and Boox, as well as RLCD tablets from companies like Daylight, are the way to go. Its display gets brighter than E Ink or RLCD tablets, but the display isn't able to accept natural light like those displays, so it's harder to see outside.</p><p>For indoor reading, however, the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus is a superb choice, offering some interesting color modes and a uniquely soft, eye-friendly image. The matte display means you can read near or under a light without having to awkwardly angle it to avoid a reflection, too. That, combined with the flicker-free, soft image, makes this incredibly pleasant and advances NXTPAPER technology in a way I had hoped for.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2f79263a-051e-4ade-9345-a150443fe9aa">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zcr4Z8qwujAeqMm5gfzGGn.jpg' alt="An official render of the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet's display and rear camera module"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>TCL's latest tablet employs NXTPAPER 4.0, the newest evolution in TCL's unique ePaper display that features even better eye comfort modes than previous generations.

Until last year, Safari offered a key feature that Chrome didn’t — native page zoom that you could control like a desktop computer, which made it ideal for browsing on the go.</p><p>Chrome eventually added this feature, but now Safari has gained another key feature: desktop-level browsing history. In particular, the way it’s implemented. Instead of requiring the user to tap the back and forward keys like Chrome on Android, the new Safari offers an easily accessible list of your browsing history.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="toVHVDtSnCuUgZYv8AMd5B" name="iOS-26-beta-safari-browsing-history-menu-2-2" alt="Safari browsing history menu and options on iOS 26 developer beta 2 on the iPhone 16 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/toVHVDtSnCuUgZYv8AMd5B.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n5HUfshPmFmbktuvG8V55B" name="iOS-26-beta-safari-browsing-history-menu-1-2" alt="Safari browsing history menu and options on iOS 26 developer beta 2 on the iPhone 16 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5HUfshPmFmbktuvG8V55B.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It’s implemented in a near-identical interface to the one you’d find on a desktop browser, and it is a huge quality-of-life improvement that ensures I’ll probably still use an Apple device for browsing. It’s a shame, as I love folding phones, and I’m eagerly awaiting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which is set to launch very soon.</p><p>It's worth noting that this is still a developer beta, and Apple has already switched from a central back and forward history menu to the individual keys pictured, so it may change further before the public beta next month and the release in the fall.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The expanded menus are my sleeper hit so far, but a fantastic all around update nonetheless pic.twitter.com/QevANX6xm7<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1933899240184422907">June 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The new context menus also impact your browsing experience in small and significant ways, especially on the iPhone. For example, press and hold a phone number, and you can choose to call it from either of your active SIM cards, as well as from internet-based apps, such as FaceTime, WhatsApp, Telegram, or Google Voice.</p><p>In the past, you would have had to copy the number, open the corresponding app, and then place the call. The new approach requires fewer steps and provides a significantly improved experience.</p><p>Every Android phone can place a call directly from the browser, but few let you choose which SIM card to use for the call, and I don’t recall another phone maker that has integrated third-party apps like Apple. Regarding third-party apps, calls from these apps are also incorporated into the dialer app, just as they were in the early HTC Sense Android interface.</p><h2 id="google-needs-to-take-chrome-on-foldables-seriously-2">Google needs to take Chrome on foldables seriously</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vykNWXh6fMw4XRDEJMktLb" name="iOS-Android-Weather-App" alt="The Pixel Weather and Apple Weather apps on Android 16 and iOS 26, respectively." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vykNWXh6fMw4XRDEJMktLb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest challenge for Google is that Chrome on Android is designed to work on every single device, which can make it more challenging to provide optimized experiences for newer form factors.</p><p>This approach has been successful for years, but it has meant that Chrome on Android is usually slower to roll out new browser features.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-launch">Phone 3</a> is Nothing's most ambitious device yet, and it continues the brand's heritage of differentiated design along with exciting software features. There's clearly a lot to like about the phone, and I'm excited to get my hands on it. But one thing stood out at the launch event: the pricing.</p><p>The Phone 3 starts at $799 in the U.S., going up to $899 for the 16GB/512GB edition. That's going to be a hard sell considering Nothing doesn't have any carrier partnerships in the U.S. The brand has a tougher battle in its biggest market, India. The 12GB/256GB model of the Phone 3 costs ₹79,999 ($933) in the country, with the 16GB/512GB edition retailing at ₹89,999 ($1,050).</p><p>That's absurd pricing in a market that's particularly price-sensitive, and I don't really know what motivated Nothing to set the price so high. The brand sells an overwhelming majority of its products — whether it's budget phones, earbuds, or CMF-branded devices — in India, so it has a good understanding of the pricing dynamics. Yet, the Phone 3 costs more in India than the U.S., and that's baffling.</p><p>What makes the pricing hard to rationalize is the fact that the Phone 3 is made locally in India. Nothing proudly says that the Phone 3 is "Designed in London. Made in India," but the pricing doesn't reflect that. The entire idea around assembling a device in the country is to lower the cost, and Chinese brands use this strategy to great effect, selling their flagships for considerably less than other markets.</p><p>Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, for instance. The phone costs ₹109,999 ($1,284) in India for the 16GB/512GB edition, and while that's a lot of cash, the same phone retails for £1,199 ($1,642) in the U.K. It's the same story with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>; the phone starts at ₹69,999 ($816) in India, and it costs $899 in the U.S.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v9dbHqfdGU8orcoas8g3kR" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v9dbHqfdGU8orcoas8g3kR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Every other brand understands that they need to be aggressive in India to have any chance at making inroads, and that's why the Phone 3 pricing in India doesn't make much sense. I don't even have to point to other brands; Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Headphone 1</a> — which launched alongside the Phone 3 — is set to retail for ₹21,999 ($256) in the country, and that's meaningfully lower than the $299 U.S. pricing.</p><p>That's true of all other products Nothing launched in the last three years; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">Phone 3a Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-cmf-buds-2-buds-2-plus-review">CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus</a>, and all of the brand's other earbuds are priced lower in India than just about any other country, but with the Phone 3, the opposite is true.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="XDvTUZxDVpeJUZWDwmWvJW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XDvTUZxDVpeJUZWDwmWvJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5154" height="2903" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's the question of the hardware; the Phone 3 misses out on Qualcomm's best silicon, instead featuring the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. It is a decent enough chipset, but it is seen on devices that cost less than half as much as the Phone 3, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/iqoo-neo-10-review">iQOO Neo 10</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-review">POCO F7</a>.</p><p>Nothing maintains that it isn't about the hardware that's used, but how it's optimized; the brand has shown in the past that it does a good job in this regard, but it just doesn't remedy the fact that you're paying more to get a phone that isn't as powerful as the OnePlus 13 and Vivo X200.</p><p>As someone who's used every single Nothing phone and accessory, I'm letdown by the Phone 3's pricing in India. The phone clearly has the potential to stand out, and it just needed Nothing to be aggressive with the pricing to allow the upstart manufacturer to gain a foothold in the premium segment. However, that isn't the case, and Nothing's short-sighted move is making the Phone 3 a harder sell than it needs to be.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That why I was excited to test the new Garmin Forerunner 570, despite my aversion to running. After all, this watch is just as its name suggests, "for runners," and a runner I am not. Still, after a month of testing, I came out mostly impressed with the 570.</p><p>This is a fantastic watch geared toward seasoned runners with a little extra cash to spend who don’t want to shell out $750 for the Forerunner 970. It includes nearly all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a Garmin watch of this caliber. However, Garmin makes some odd choices by omitting features one would expect to see on a watch of this price, which feels like an attempt to push users toward the better and more expensive model.</p><p>The result is a good-enough fitness watch that feels like the awkward middle child.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-forerunning-570-price-availability-and-specs"><span>Garmin Forerunning 570: Price, availability, and specs</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6KeEub4SF7CU8oPPRqdgLH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-08" alt="Garmin Forerunner 570 screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6KeEub4SF7CU8oPPRqdgLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Forerunner 570 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-and-570-revealed-all-key-upgrades">announced</a> alongside the 970 in May 2025.

For one, the way notifications are handled is pretty annoying. I could be in the middle of a workout, and if I receive a notification, it will linger on the display for longer than necessary. It will partially block the view of my workout screen until I swipe it away, which can be inconvenient when in the middle of a run.</p><p>In fact, notifications can be quite annoying because you can’t adjust the vibration intensity, despite the watch’s haptics being quite pleasant and subtle. Thus, I’ve had to turn off most notifications completely.</p><p>The watch seems to have trouble maintaining a connection to my phone, even if they’re right next to each other. Multiple times a day, I would receive notifications that it had been disconnected, only for it to reconnect about 10 seconds later. This is a behavior I haven't experienced on the Vivoactive 6 or Venu 3, so I’m not quite sure what that’s about.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XUyLJD5y2TkZg5i2qRFpgH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-03" alt="A notification on the Garmin Forerunner 570" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XUyLJD5y2TkZg5i2qRFpgH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>GPS tracking is as good as you'd expect on a Garmin watch of this caliber, but users may not like that the watch doesn’t support offline maps, which could be a dealbreaker for more outdoorsy types who enjoy going on hikes.

Currently, rumors and leaks point to the Pixel 10 keeping a few things from the Pixel 9 while adding major upgrades. If you're in the market for a new Android phone, you might be wondering how the upcoming Pixel 10 is expected to compare to the current model.</p><p>Based on Google's new release schedule for Pixels, we'll likely see the Pixel 10 sometime in August 2025. That's about a month away, and leaks are intensifying as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">possible launch dates</a> get closer. Here's everything we know so far about how the Pixel 10 will improve upon the successful Pixel 9.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Pixel 9: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> is expected to retain a similar design to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, perhaps with a larger camera bump and slightly different dimensions. Leaked renders reveal the existence of a pink colorway for the Pixel 10 that's more muted than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-9-should-you-buy">Peony option available on the Pixel 9</a>. Otherwise, the Pixel 10 appears to keep the same build as the Pixel 9, with flat aluminum side rails featuring chamfered edges and a glass back.</p><p>Exact dimensions for the Pixel 10 aren't available, but the Pixel 9 measures 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm and weighs 198 grams. The new model will likely keep similar dimensions, although not identical, which eliminates the chance of cross-generation case compatibility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AsbNJBPaY3XYKkQhE6bug4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-02" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AsbNJBPaY3XYKkQhE6bug4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it would be nice to see the Pixel 10 cut some weight to compete with flagships from Apple and Samsung, it's unclear whether Google will go that route. The rumored larger camera bump and telephoto lens could make the phone heavier, not lighter.</p><p>A hint that the Pixel 10 will have tweaked dimensions came by way of Thinborne, which listed Pixel 10 cases early.

At a minimum, the Pixel 10 display should match the Pixel 9's display specifications. That means you'll get a 6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED with a 2424 x 1080 resolution. We should also see HDR support and a peak brightness rating of at least 2,700 nits.</p><p>To differentiate the Pixel 10 display from that of the Pixel 9, Google could make a tweak or two. While the "Pro" models are expected to gain higher PWM capabilities, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-display-leak-pwm-dimming-rate">the base-model Pixel 10 is rumored to miss out</a> on this functionality.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Pixel 9: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WFcrajSuHh2pA2Mx3EkwtN" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-20.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WFcrajSuHh2pA2Mx3EkwtN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 is expected to feature the Tensor G5 as its processor, which isn't exactly surprising. Each generation of Pixel phones has received a new Tensor chip since Google made the switch to its own silicon designs. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-reportedly-closed-a-multi-year-deal-with-tsmc-starting-with-the-pixel-10">the Tensor G5 is reportedly the first chip to be made by TSMC</a> instead of Samsung Foundry, which could be a major leap.</p><p>Aside from gaining access to TSMC's advanced fabrication processes, Google may also have the opportunity to include more custom components in the Pixel 10. It will supposedly add a fully-custom image-signal processor (ISP) for the first time, for example. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">leaked parts list for the Tensor G5 serves as a preview</a> of what kind of upgrades might arrive on the Pixel 10.</p><p>Considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">the Tensor G4 is widely considered to be a disappointment</a> compared to the Apple A18 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, this could be crucial for the Pixel 10 to remain competitive. The Pixel 9 and its Tensor G4 system-on-a-chip excel at AI tasks, but fall short in raw performance.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 (rumored/assumed)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14, seven software updates (upgradeable to Android 16)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 2424x1080, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 2700 nits max</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 2424x1080, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 2700 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G4, Titan M2, 4nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/1.7, 25mm (wide), 1/2.0-inch, 0.8µm, dual pixel PDAF, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.68 1/1.31-inch module, 82-degree FoV, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>10.8 MP, f/3.1, 112mm (telephoto), 1/3.2-inch, dual pixel PDAF, OIS, 5x optical zoom</p></td><td  ><p>48MP f/1.7 1/2.55-inch module, wide-angle, 123-degree FoV</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP f2.2, autofocus, 95-degree FoV</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP f2.2, autofocus, 95-degree FoV</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi 6 (India), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi 6 (India), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,970mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh battery,</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm, 198g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Pink, other colors unknown </p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain, Wintergreen, Peony</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Otherwise, the Pixel 10 is expected to keep the exact same RAM and storage options as the Pixel 9. In that case, both phones would have 12GB of memory and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. Higher capacities would be reserved for the more expensive Pixel 10 models, unless Google decides to make a change.</p><p>The Pixel 10 may also feature top-of-the-line connectivity support, including 5G and Wi-Fi 7, just like its predecessor. The Pixel 9 only had Bluetooth 5.3 support, so it'll be interesting to see whether the Pixel 10 sports a newer spec. In terms of biometrics, we expect to see an under-display fingerprint sensor and facial recognition.</p><p>The only other rumored hardware change is a bump to battery capacity, which is said to be 4,970mAh on the Pixel 10.

Usually, this is the time in a company's life cycle when it starts to play it safe, but the Nothing Headphone 1 do anything but. These headphones double down on what people love about Nothing, offering a unique design, competitive feature set, and an enticing value proposition.</p><p>At just $300, Nothing's Headphone 1 undercuts the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">premium over-ears</a> such as the Bose QuietComfort Ultra, Sonos Ace, and Sony WH-1000XM6. Surprisingly, the Headphone 1 holds its own compared to those competitors. The experience feels decidedly premium, and comfort is top-notch.</p><p>Audiophiles will nitpick the headphones' sound signature a bit, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/the-nothing-headphone-1-wants-to-make-noise-in-more-ways-than-one">Nothing Headphone 1</a> is a compelling package anyway. It does enough things really well at an attractive price point to make you consider buying them, even if you don't have a Nothing phone already.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-headphone-1-price-and-availability"><span>Nothing Headphone 1: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="usDaovFM3YcWC3Y67EuEH3" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-3" alt="The Nothing Headphone 1 case opened up, revealing the headphones and included cables." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/usDaovFM3YcWC3Y67EuEH3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing officially revealed the Headphone 1 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Muen4f4L_6M?si=oTNGLIRma6SMIZ2s" target="_blank">YouTube livestream</a> on July 1, 2025, and pre-orders open globally as of July 4, 2025. The headphones retail for $299 in the U.S., £299 in the U.K., and €299 elsewhere in Europe. They're available in black and white, and both colorways feature a transparent window giving a sneak peek at what's inside.</p><p>Nothing Headphone 1 was made in partnership with KEF, a renowned audio brand, to give the headphones a custom sound.

At first glance, Headphone 1 looks somewhat like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/i-pitted-the-airpods-max-against-my-usd3000-audio-setup">AirPods Max</a> lookalike.

The rectangular shape of the headphone chassis, made out of aluminum, feels premium. Then, the oval-shaped plastic window sits atop it to provide a little bit of flair. The translucency is a bit of a gimmick, as you can't really see much inside, but it's still a neat addition that matches nicely with other Nothing products.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="awEcSoSpMb8jFPtxNEjGxh" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-11" alt="Wearing the Nothing Headphone 1 while holding up the Nothing Phone 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/awEcSoSpMb8jFPtxNEjGxh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nothing's Headphone 1 fits right in if you have one of the company's phones. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the loud design language, Nothing Headphone 1 is fairly compact. The ear cups and main chassis are only 78mm thick combined, and most of that are the polyurethane foam-filled ear cushions. They weigh 329 grams, which is less than the gargantuan AirPods Max but more than most other over-ear competitors.</p><p>Still, I think I underestimated the Headphone 1's thin plastic headband. While looking a bit cheap compared to the aluminum housing, the adjustable and telescoping headband gets the job done. Nothing's Headphone 1 is right up there with some of my favorite headphones for comfort, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/these-sonos-headphones-arent-perfect-heres-why-i-still-recommend-them">including the Sonos Ace</a>.</p><p>I could wear Headphone 1 for hours-long listening sessions with no discomfort, and found a good fit within seconds of putting them on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TjPPnqVvhUA29K6WmDzrDo" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-5" alt="A tilted view of the Nothing Headphone 1 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TjPPnqVvhUA29K6WmDzrDo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nothing Headphone 1's design isn't the only thing unique about this pair of headphones. The sound signature and audio experience is different, too. At the heart of things is a custom 40mm dynamic driver surrounded by 8.9mm of polyurethane to minimize distortion. It features custom tuning in partnership with KEF, and Nothing says Headphone 1 "presents a sound profile that reproduces music as the artist intended."</p><p>After listening to hours of music with Headphone 1, I'd say they sound generally good, but I'm not sure the above description is accurate. Nothing's Headphone 1 are tuned to prioritize the bass and lower frequencies more than mids and highs. Compared to something with a flatter frequency distribution — I often use Audio Technica ATH-M50X's for reference — Headphone 1 certainly adds its own unique flavor.</p><p>In my experience, the Nothing Headphone 1 will sound great about 90% of the time. However, you're likely to run into a few tracks that just sound off because the vocals or high-end sounds are muddied by an overreaching bass. If one of these songs just happens to be one you listen to a lot, the difference in sound might be obvious. Most of the time, you're going to get a very full sound out of the Nothing Headphone 1.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edLhseRVCoLqKPhENoJoUG" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-X-app" alt="Setting up and changing the settings for the Nothing Headphone 1 in the Nothing X app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edLhseRVCoLqKPhENoJoUG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The reason why this isn't too big of a deal is that Nothing is very transparent about Headphone 1's sound signature, for the most part. You can see this prioritization of lows and mids in the visual range for the <strong>Balanced</strong> EQ mode in the Nothing X companion app.</p><p>If you don't like it, you can easily adjust it. I found myself switching to the <strong>More treble</strong> EQ preset if I knew I was actively listening to genres like folk, alternative, or jazz, and that addressed some of my concerns. The headphones' spatial audio modes help add separation to the soundstage, too, and the head tracking is effective. I don't always like listening to music in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">spatial audio</a>, but in this case, it added the clarity to things such as vocals or cymbals I was craving.</p><p>The level of control you get over Headphone 1, both in the app and on-device, is what makes the headphones great. For instance, you can choose between having active noise-cancelation or transparency mode on or off, but you can also adjust the strength of the ANC. This is handy, and I prefer it to how other headphones handle ANC modes, as it can be hard to tell when they're on or off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yjqrgvMZRHjG45fKorx6U" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-8" alt="The roller and paddle on the Nothing Headphone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yjqrgvMZRHjG45fKorx6U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of on-device controls, it's impossible not to mention everything the Nothing Headphone 1 offers. You get a paddle for playback control and a roller for volume, play/pause function, and ANC modes. There's also another button for voice assistant control and a dedicated Bluetooth pairing button. Oh, and Headphone 1 has its own on/off switch too.</p><p>I'd reconfigure the controls slightly, setting the voice assistant button to cycle through ANC modes instead. Otherwise, they're incredibly helpful, and way better than capacitive touch controls or a clunky button with too many functions. Paired with a USB-C port and 3.5mm jack, Headphone 1 goes old-school with hardware controls and ports, and I love it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-headphone-1-what-s-not-good"><span>Nothing Headphone 1: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Tb4miSRtuJJFcPhKBiHXc" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-10" alt="The ear cushions on the Nothing Headphone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tb4miSRtuJJFcPhKBiHXc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review"><strong>Nothing Ear 2 </strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review"><strong>Nothing Ear Open</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review"><strong>Nothing Ear</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Nothing got a lot right with the Headphone 1, but I would've liked to see the pair handle a wider variety of songs more consistently. As I alluded to earlier, Headphone 1's sound tuning doesn't favor every kind of track. When you run into that one song that doesn't sound quite right, it might bug you. By comparison, something like the Sonos Ace can handle more songs without you needing to break into the Nothing X app equalizer.</p><p>Another part of the Headphone 1 experience that is <em>mostly</em> good are the buttons. It's great that they are here, but the paddle in particular could be easier to use. By default, the paddle can be flicked left or right to restart a song or change tracks. You're supposed to double-flick the paddle to go to the previous song, but need to take an awkward pause to do it.

The Sonos Ace, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-post-malone-noise-cancelling-headphones-launch">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> all cost around $450 — that's $150 more than the Headphone 1 retails for.</p><p>Rather, the Nothing Headphone 1 competes more directly with a pair of over-ears like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/beats-studio-pro-launch">Beats Studio Pro</a>. They retail for $350 and are frequently on sale, and I've used them for months. Nothing's over-ears blow the Studio Pro out of the water, as Beats' offering is made out of cheap plastic and has a mediocre sound. So, when you consider the Headphone 1's price point, it's easier to look past some of its flaws.</p><p>You might be able to snag an older pair of Sony or Bose headphones for around the same price as the Headphone 1. You could certainly find a pair of wired headphones for less than the Nothing Headphone 1 that sound better. But if we're talking about new, wireless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">over-ear headphones with ANC</a>, the Nothing Headphone 1 fit the $300 price point very well.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-headphone-1-should-you-buy-it"><span>Nothing Headphone 1: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PCKLr2iDP9tjT3vFRCtQS" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-6" alt="The Nothing Headphone 1 hanging off a pole." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PCKLr2iDP9tjT3vFRCtQS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You like Nothing's eccentric design language</li><li>You want a pair of wireless, over-ear headphones with ANC</li><li>You have around $300 to spend and prioritize a premium build</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want a pair of headphones with a more balanced soundstage</li><li>You feel overwhelmed by the amount of buttons</li><li>You don't like the loud design</li></ul><p>Nothing products aren't for everyone, but Headphone 1 might be the brand's most appealing product for the masses yet.

But an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.syss.com/posts/bluetooth-analysis-coros-pace-3/">IT exposé from SySS GmbH</a> has revealed a major security vulnerability, and COROS has been slow to acknowledge and address it.</p><p>According to the report, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> does not properly authenticate or encrypt the Bluetooth connection between your watch and phone, bypassing the "Secure Connections" tool introduced in Bluetooth 4.2 for a simpler connection.</p><p>A hijacker can exploit this vulnerability and force-pair to your watch if it becomes disconnected from your phone at any time, letting them perform these actions:</p><ul><li>"Hijacking the vicitim’s COROS account and accessing all data</li><li>Eavesdropping sensitive data, e.g. notifications</li><li>Manipulating the device configuration</li><li>Factory resetting the device</li><li>Crashing the device</li><li>Interrupting a running activity and forcing the recorded data to be lost"</li></ul><p>Your COROS account could show info like where you typically start your runs, as well as login details. But the notification access seems particularly frightening, as they can "eavesdrop" on <strong>every</strong> notification your connected phone receives. They can even "inject" fake notifications onto your watch using a Python script.</p><p>The attacker could also go to a race event and factory-reset every COROS watch in the area remotely, without the victims being able to determine who is doing it.</p><p>Interestingly, the SySS GmbH report notes that hijackers' access is easier with connected Android phones. iOS encrypts the Bluetooth connection at the system level, but with Android, the watch skips the "AuthReq" step and simply pairs, so the connection is "neither encrypted nor authenticated" by default.</p><p>All a hijacker needs to do is "wait for an Android phone with the COROS app installed to come into Bluetooth range." After that, "any ongoing BLE connection between an Android phone and the watch can be intercepted, sniffed, or tampered with, making attacks far more practical and harder to detect."</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>A COROS rep shared the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/38933102526996-Bluetooth-Security-Vulnerability-Statement">Bluetooth Security Vulnerability Statement</a>, which clarifies that this hacking attempt will need to be within "30 feet" and that Android users should force-quit the COROS app when not in use, which "prevents notifications from being passed to the watch in rare attack scenarios." They also recommend you set up a new COROS device "in a non-public setting."</p><h2 id="how-coros-is-addressing-the-security-risk-2">How COROS is addressing the security risk</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PLRb7puJ9nfFwnJTpDd69i" name="COROS-PACE-3-heart-rate-zones.jpeg" alt="Post-workout heart rate zones on the COROS PACE 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PLRb7puJ9nfFwnJTpDd69i.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/06/coros-confirms-substantial-watch-security-vulnerablity-says-fixes-are-coming.html">DC Rainmaker</a>, SySS GmbH reported these vulnerabilities to COROS starting on March 14, 2025. It continued to provide more information and ask COROS for a response; eventually, on April 15, COROS responded that their "fix for the vulnerability is planned for the end of the year (2025)."</p><p>Maker followed up with COROS in late June, and its CEO, Lewis Wu, clarified that while the report focused on the PACE 3, the "Bluetooth stack is largely shared across our watches, so these vulnerabilities apply broadly to most COROS devices." This includes the COROS DURA bike computer and all recent watch models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">PACE Pro</a>.</p><p>Wu also addressed the seeming lack of urgency to these major issues:</p><div><blockquote><p>When we were notified, we started working on the issues but I have to admit the priority should have been higher. It’s a learning for COROS to prioritize security related problems. We had responded to the individual who reported these concerns with an over-simplified answer of “before the end of 2025″, but should have been more specific on the timeline with each item rather than speaking in broad terms and stated these will be fixed long before the end of this year.</p></blockquote></div><p>According to Wu, COROS hopes to resolve four vulnerabilities related to "pairing of Bluetooth devices" before the end of July, and then the "ones tied to the encryption of communication to the device" before the end of August, updating each COROS device "one by one."</p><p>COROS' support page clarifies that the PACE 3 and Pro, APEX 2 and 2 Pro, VERTIX 2 and 2S, and DURA will receive the fix by end of July, while older devices (the PACE 2, APEX 1, and VERTIX 1" will receive it "shortly after."</p><p>This security vulnerability should give fans of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> or Apple Watches a new appreciation for their monthly security updates, resolving any issues promptly. For smaller fitness brands, they may not have the same resources or QC, nor the same scrutiny.</p><p>We're relieved that COROS is kicking this fix into high gear, while also wishing that it had shown more urgency initially in protecting its customers' data.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the comments <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Nyx_lost1/status/1939985475248312695">expressed their displeasure</a> with this potential, the publication reiterates a Geekbench listing for the tablet. According to the post, the Tab S10 Lite supposedly ran through its benchmark test, which delivered a 782 score for its single-core test and a 2,637 score for its multi-core portion.</p><h2 id="affordable-points-toward-mid-range-2">Affordable points toward mid-range</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Tab S10 Lite Software tests have started ‼️Exynos 1380 chipset set to be used Build test: X406BXXU0AYF9/X406BOXM0AYF9/X406BXXU0AYF9The tablet is probably planned to be introduced with the Tab S11 series#samsung #tabS10lite pic.twitter.com/kXHYkuL37T<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1939985031759274110">July 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We last heard rumors about an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">alleged Galaxy Tab S10 Lite in April</a>, shortly after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Tab S10 FE launched</a>. While Samsung's FE branding typically indicates a lower price point than its flagship models, tacking on "Lite" should (ideally) bring that down even further. Those early rumors were light, only digging up its supposed name and use of cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity (each its own variant) for the market.</p><p>However, it was also speculated that the chip could use Samsung's two-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-1380-launch">Exynos 1380 chipset</a>, which we've seen again today. This chip was designed with midrange devices in mind. In 2023, the chip debuted with the Arm Mali G68 GPU and an octa-core CPU featuring four Arm Cortex A78s and four Cortex A55s. There's increased speculation that the chip could support a 144Hz refresh rate, as well.</p><p>Other specs, like its display size, are still a wonder; however, the Tab S10 FE featured a 10.9-inch screen, so perhaps the Lite will arrive around there (or smaller). Additionally, Samsung priced the Tab S10 FE and S10 Plus FE at $499 and $649, respectively.</p><p>If the Tab S10 Lite drops with the Tab S11 series, we might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks">have to wait until the fall</a> to see them.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-1182909916679810686&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fipad-tablets-ereaders%2Ftablets%2Fpcmcat209000050008.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat209000050008" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-2966126632566758786&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dtablet" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1825920675507257921&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Ftablets-laptops-computers-deals%2F&article_name=Galaxy%20Tab%20S11%20Ultra%20surfaces%20in%20new%20leak%20with%20a%20boosted%20flagship%20MediaTek%20chip&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Ftablets%2Fsamsung-galaxy-tab%2Fgalaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablet%26crid%3D2HCFROTF588S1%26sprefix%3Dtablet%252Caps%252C159%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1086904816089408270-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-17070419?sid=ac-us-5673602041223193278&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

There&apos;s the "Big Deal Days" sale event in October, and Amazon has also begun holding a "Big Spring Sale" every March. Then there are typically sales around significant US holidays, such as Memorial Day and Presidents&apos; Day. </p><p>That being said, there&apos;s only one <em>true</em> Prime Day, and its offers generally beat every other sale event except Black Friday/Cyber Monday. In other words, if you want to find a great deal at Amazon, Prime Day is the best time to do it (unless you want to wait until November). </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, head to our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It's worth noting that the tipster called the device by what would be its codename. The Hypernova is expected to drop as the Meta Ray-Ban 3 (3rd Gen) whenever the company is ready. Now, from the leaked rendering, we can spot a pair of glasses similar in design to the previous 2nd Gen model.</p><p>The coloring approach seems similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-and-meta-unveil-new-smart-glasses-but-good-luck-snagging-a-pair">Meta's latest smart glasses release</a> with Ray-Ban. The latest model features solid coloring for the frames; however, there was a limited edition translucent pair, which makes us wonder if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">that'll come back</a>.</p><h2 id="meta-s-vr-future-2">Meta's VR Future</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meta Hypernova and Ceres Wristband (low res) pic.twitter.com/N1QS28A5ef<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1939793338141426109">June 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>It also seems like the arms are slightly wider, especially toward the lenses. The design of the front also appears to stick to the slightly higher aesthetic toward the sides, giving a butterfly effect.</p><p>Another interesting product alongside the glasses is Meta's rumored sEMG bracelet. Its design seems relatively similar to official images we've seen from Meta. With both devices appearing suddenly like this in a new leak, there's speculation that a launch could be fast approaching.</p><p>Speaking of launch, Luna suggests <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1939913956992147533?t=Dzfik0Bfdt7amZHmvzq83w&s=19">in a separate post</a> that Meta could be gearing up for a slight name change. Instead of running with Hypernova or simply using Ray-Ban Meta again, these glasses could launch as the "Meta Celeste." What's more, the tipster claims the company could stylize this as "Meta | Celeste."</p><h2 id="android-games-2">Android & Games</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At least in the early firmware, Meta Hypernova (Celeste preliminary) seems to have a built-in mini-game called Hypertrail.

Luna claims the glasses might feature a game called "Hypertrail," which seems to be inspired by the retro game Galaga, and may even "involve the user's location in some way."</p><p>Meta's next-gen Ray-Ban glasses have garnered some hype, especially since this device is expected to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-2026-smart-glasses-live-ai-facial-software-report">have a display built in</a>. The Hypernova (3rd gen Ray-Ban) is said to have a singular screen implanted in the right lens at the bottom. Moreover, the report from April stated the glasses could feature a full set of Android-powered computational software. As such, the Hypernova could receive a stacked array of apps already on deck; however, it might lack a full-fledged app store.</p><p>While the Hypernova probably won't replace your phone, it'll likely serve as an input alternative that still relies on that connection.</p><p>Reports add that Meta is likely working on some camera improvements for these glasses, too. Meta is expected to release these Hypernova glasses sometime in 2025, but there are already rumors of a Hypernova 2 that might sport two displays, one in each lens.</p><p>The sEMG bracelet we've seen leaked today (July 1) is something Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">playtested earlier this year</a>. The bracelet is designed to take XR (augmented reality) to new heights, giving users a more intuitive method for digital input. The sEMG is said to be "more private" than voice input when in public places, and it keeps you a little more aware, as you're not preoccupied with a handheld screen.</p><p>The bracelet also seems quite necessary for Meta's smart glasses future as, according to Sutrich, "Using a pair of smart glasses without this band is akin to using a smartphone without a touch screen."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Moreover, shortly after their appearance, Spigen seemingly removed both pages. Clicking on the link now returns a "404 Error—Oops! Not Found" page. In our most recent query, you can still see the company's official links for the would-be cases by typing "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Spigen case" in Google Search.</p><h2 id="finally-an-fe-clamshell-2">Finally an FE clamshell?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.89%;"><img id="f4JhVnZdVsEtpkLZtcJWSU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-google-spigen-listings" alt="A screenshot of Spigen's early case listings in Google Search for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the seemingly confirmed Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f4JhVnZdVsEtpkLZtcJWSU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1105" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Expecting the Galaxy Z Flip 7 flagship model seems like a no-brainer; however, we've been hearing rumors about an FE variant for a while now, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-appears-on-certification-sites-launch-imminent">more "evidence" keeps appearing</a>. A recent discovery, made through an NBTC (National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission) listing, reportedly revealed the Flip 7 FE's certification details. The listing showcased the phone's two model numbers: SM-F761B and SM-F761U, which are speculated to be Samsung's planned regions for marketing.</p><p>Aside from the NBTC (Thailand) certification, the device has also seemingly rolled through the FCC and BIS.</p><p>Now, with Spigen's early case collection slip-up, perhaps that's all we need to "confirm" the Flip 7 FE is real. But, to be safe, let's wait for Samsung.</p><p>Earlier leaks from March touched on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">the Flip 7 FE's design</a> through some leaked renders. It seems the Korean OEM is delivering an FE device that plays off the Flip 6's design with the tab-like folder cover display. Leaks claimed the phone could rock a 3.4-inch cover display (two cameras) and a slightly smaller 6.7-inch internal screen. Additional rumors suggest the phone could also receive a 4,000mAh battery setup.</p><p>Rumors have been topsy-turvy when it comes to its chip of choice. Some rumors wonder if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500</a> could power it, but the latest whispers from the grape vines say it'll be the Exynos 2400e.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-2282325611610096984&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-4951089434236751115&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fcell-phones%2F1105910%3Fpovid%3Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-5823325962126417475&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=More%20Galaxy%20Z%20Flip%207%20FE%20evidence%20shows%20up%20online%2C%20hinting%20at%20its%20existence&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-appears-on-certification-sites-launch-imminent" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1002821762707921502-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5992850065951796107&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-3410128764527278645&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The back isn't just unique and interesting looking, though, it does away with Nothing's trademark Glyph Interface and replaces it with something else: a micro-LED screen called the Glyph Matrix.</p><p>As the name would imply, this is an intentionally low-resolution display designed to look retro chic, similar to how the company has been using dot matrix style fonts and UI elements on its phones for years. But Glyph Matrix isn't just a cute little screen or a smaller replacement for the Glyph Interface LEDs on prior Nothing phones, it provides a whole new set of functions that build on Nothing's most unique feature.</p><p>A click of the button on the back will cycle between a battery indicator, stopwatch, mirror, digital clock, solar clock, and even a handful of bespoke games Nothing calls Glyph Toys. It also emulates Glyph Interface functions, such as per-contact notifications and progress indicators. Nothing also published a Glyph Matrix SDK for the Nothing Community to build new games, so expect lots of grassroots support for this feature.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2YEAJkDKT38T8rqmJ9Yxx" name="nothing-phone-3-official-black-and-white" alt="Official imagery of the Nothing Phone 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YEAJkDKT38T8rqmJ9Yxx.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the back is a trio of new cameras that fixes one of the few things we didn't like about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>, including a new 1/1.3” 50MP main sensor with OIS, a 50MP ultrawide sensor, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-shows-off-phone-3s-periscope-lens-in-its-latest-tease">50MP periscope camera</a> with OIS and 3x optical zoom, and a 114-degree FoV 50MP front-facing camera.

In its press release, Threads stated that users can start texting each other one-on-one via DMs, without switching back and forth between Instagram and Threads.</p><p>It also noted that despite Threads being Instagram's twin, users on the platform tend to follow different accounts based on the content they put out on Threads, and introducing DMs would help users reach out to the accounts they follow.</p><p>That said, as of now, the app will only allow messages between the people who follow you and mutual followers who are 18 and up, keeping safety and privacy in mind. "As we expand messaging, we’re prioritizing safety to help make DMs another place for positive interactions on Threads," the press release explained.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7295px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.26%;"><img id="DyWLwtqm9vb8csAdqbadGh" name="Threads_DMs" alt="Threads gets DMs and Highlighter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DyWLwtqm9vb8csAdqbadGh.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7295" height="3156" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Threads)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Threads also mentioned that it will be making improvements to DMs by bringing Group Messaging, which will allow you to connect with multiple people around a conversation. Users will gain more control over who sends them messages, and quickly filter through unread messages with inbox filters. These features will be added to messaging "soon."</p><p>That said, Threads is also rolling out a new feature that won't let you miss trending topics even if you wanted to. A new Highlighter feature will highlight trending topics in yellow, which is aimed at sparking meaningful conversations. The feature will initially appear within the content discovery sections of the app, with more placements of the highlighter coming soon.</p><p>The press release also added that as Threads enters its third year since its inception, its primary focus is on empowering communities and creators, promoting fresh viewpoints, and fostering a thriving environment for conversations. So if you're an avid Threads user, you can give these features a go right away!</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Shaky hands? Get yourself a nice phone grip. I have the butteriest butter fingers ever, meaning I drop things all the time, and the simple addition of a magnetic phone grip rewrote the script for me, literally helping me <strong>get a grip</strong>. My current favorite phone grip that's highly durable is the metallic one from UAG because it's extra sturdy. In fact, I ranked it among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-favorite-magsafe-phone-grips-ranked">my top three phone grips</a> of all time.</p><p>Nothing beats the comfort of a PopSocket, but those things are quite flimsy in comparison to what UAG has to offer. My beloved PopSocket broke a little over a year into use, but the UAG is still going strong a year later. Since the brand focuses on the rugged smartphone accessory niche, the people behind the UAG Magnetic Ring Stand know what they're doing.</p><p>If you only buy one phone grip, this should be it. It can be used in so many different configurations, despite being a tough metallic construct.</p><p>My one gripe with this magnetic grip was that it's pretty expensive, but now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a>'s coming up, you should keep your eyes peeled for a deal on this grip. We've seen it go on sale before, so I'm certain you can nab one for a solid discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The UAG Magnetic Ring Stand can be used in multiple configurations, whether as a regular ring-shaped phone grip or as a phone stand in either landscape or portrait orientation.

You won't find a more durable phone grip than this. It's also quite grippy thanks to the top coat, which adds an ever-so-slight grainy matte texture. I can't name a single time when I accidentally dropped my phone while using this grip.</p><p>There are multiple ways to use the Magnetic Ring Stand from UAG. The creative design allows for a full 360-degree rotation. It also enables you to bend and contort the hexagonal stand in so many different configurations, propping up your phone at various angles and orientations.</p><p>The UAG Magnetic Ring Stand comes with a magnetic adapter ring for non-MagSafe or non-Qi2 phones, so you don't have to worry about incompatibility either. And since you get a magnetic ring, you can take the Magnetic Ring Stand off to charge your phone wirelessly or mount it on something like a car phone holder.</p><p>The UAG Magnetic Ring Stand comes in seven colors, and while this isn't anywhere near as diverse as PopSockets, it's still a pleasant collection of crowd-pleasing shades. From blues and greens to bright pink and silver hues, it's a fun selection of colors.</p><p>I'm still waiting on my UAG grip to break, but it's going strong. Based on my user experience so far, I feel confident that it's going to last me a long time. If it's the only grip you buy, this is the one to get.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Carrier deals: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><u><strong>T-Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
