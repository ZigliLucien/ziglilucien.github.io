                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It has been approximately two years since I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-balance-review">Amazfit Balance</a>. Initially, I was impressed by the smartwatch's seemingly endless battery life that refused to drain weeks in. Now that the watch is a few years old, we've seen a decent price drop. In my eyes, this makes it an even more worthy buy in 2025.</p><p>Two years on, I still use the Amazfit Balance every other day. It covers all the basics and performs smoothly until today, and the battery has not degraded either. I get to track all my health and fitness metrics, there's onboard storage for music, and there are plenty of other useful features like the ability to respond to texts.</p><p>The Amazfit Balance launched in September 2023 at a neat $199.99 price tag. You can currently buy the Balance smartwatch for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M/"><strong>$149.99 at Amazon</strong></a> or other retailers. And with Amazon's October Prime Day on the horizon, you could probably score an even sweeter deal on this Amazfit wearable. Compared to the newer Amazfit Balance 2 that costs an insane $299.99, I still recommend the original Balance model if you're on a tight budget. This smartwatch was so well-rounded that I continue to recommend it as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches#section-best-starter-option">best starter option when looking at top Amazfit smartwatches</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8dbf869f-1aa5-417d-a27d-3675a72137af" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="It might be two years old, but this toddler is still going strong and definitely worth your attention.

If you're new to smartwatches and fitness wearables, this is an excellent entry point. The software isn't very complex, the initial setup is pretty straightforward, and you don't need to be very familiar with a wearable to figure out where everything is.</p><p>The has Alexa built-in, along with an onboard speaker and mic, so you can control your smart home and give Alexa commands or prompts. There's local storage if you want to store music on the watch and connect a pair of wireless headphones or earbuds with it. There's even NFC for contactless payments.</p><p>The 46mm case doesn't even feel like it's there, because the watch is so lightweight. The overall design is stunning, and the AMOLED display stays bright, crisp, and easily visible under the merciless sun.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3485px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3EeQpiajkQnqWGS3tyyuRV" name="Amazfit Balance" alt="Amazfit Balance smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3EeQpiajkQnqWGS3tyyuRV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3485" height="1960" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're going out for a run or working out, the Amazfit Balance is a comfortable fitness tracker that can keep track of your activities for you. Like any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches">great Amazfit watch</a>, the Amazfit Balance has hundreds of sports modes and can track a wide variety of activities beyond just walks and runs.</p><p>Since it has GPS, you can even record the location of your workouts. I like to log my walks and runs so I can view the route I took later. It's a great way to plan and track your activities. And with AI features like Zepp Flow and Zepp Coach, you can harness the power of AI to reach your fitness goals.</p><p>Amazfit introduced the full-sized QWERTY keyboard to reply to text messages on the Amazfit Balance. Back when I first tested the watch, it was a little janky. But now, this feature works much better than before.</p><p>This is a fantastic smartwatch overall, ideal for newbies in the wearable space who still want some extras but can't commit to Wear OS just yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, released in September 2025, are the same AI glasses everyone knows and loves, now with longer battery life, improved camera quality, and more styles to choose from.</p><p>But the newest kid on the block, Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, does exactly what it says on the tin. Instead of being purely audio-only, like the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, the newer Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses feature a nifty display in the right lens that works much like a smartwatch. They're also more than twice the price of Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, so while they feel like the future on your face, there's a price to pay to get there.</p><p>So, do you need the most expensive pair of smart glasses Meta offers, or would it make more sense for you to save some money and opt for the tried-and-true AI glasses?

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 is entirely reliant on voice interaction for nearly all of its functions, but it features a physical camera shutter button on the top of the right arm, as well as a touchpad on the right arm that can be used to adjust volume, play or pause music, and more.</p><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses feature these same inputs in addition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">a neural band</a> that's used to detect gestures made with your hands. The cloth band fits comfortably on the wrist you'll primarily use to interact with the glasses' menus and can understand your movements via electrical impulses in your wrist muscles.</p><p>This allows Meta to open up an entire operating system's worth of functionality for Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, including the ability to perform tasks like zooming in with the glasses' camera without needing to touch your glasses or use your voice. You can even reply to messages by "writing" on a table with your hand, or perform fun actions like pinching and rotating your fingers to adjust volume or zoom in and out of the camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi" name="meta-connect-2025-show-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-app-ui" alt="A screen capture of Mark Zuckerberg showing off Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' app UI at Meta Connect 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The UI on the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses falls somewhere between a smartwatch and a smartphone, offering numerous ways to perform everyday tasks that are too cumbersome for a smaller smartwatch display. Since it's on your face, Meta says it allows you to be more present with people in the room, rather than looking down at your watch or phone to check notifications or messages.</p><p>The display in Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses enables visual use of Meta AI in a way that's not possible with the audio-only Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s. While both types of glasses can perform many similar functions — such as taking photos or videos, providing live translation, playing music through the speakers, or using AI to identify objects in front of you — the addition of a display enables far more interactive elements.</p><p>The display on the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses features a convenient accessibility feature called Live Captions, which utilizes the camera and AI to identify the people you're talking to, then displays closed captions on the glasses' display. Since no one can see the display from the outside, these captions are entirely private to you and can be great for noisy environments or people who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses also have a visual viewfinder for the cameras, while Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 users will have to just click the button and hope the picture is lined up right. Ironically, though, Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 has a more capable camera that can record at up to 3K resolution or at 1080p/60FPS. That's an upgrade over the 1080p/30FPS camera in Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses.</p><h2 id="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-vs-ray-ban-meta-gen-2-which-should-you-buy-2">Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses vs. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2): Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-live-captions" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing live captions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Content creators will likely want to choose the smoother or higher-resolution video on the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s, as the first-person perspective and ultrawide angle are able to capture everything in front of you without an issue.

The big thing Nothing is highlighting in this update is the ability for users to activate call recording with the push of a button.

After the call is over, your Nothing Phone will deliver another notification, stating the recording has been saved and that you can hop into your Essential Space to view it. Nothing's AI will generate a title based on the context of your conversation. It'll also state who was involved and display the recording for you to listen back.</p><p>Additionally, the AI will generate a transcript of the call with a brief paragraph summary and some main "highlights."</p><h2 id="making-the-essential-space-essential-2">Making the Essential Space...

Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV" name="lloyd-should-you-buy_720" caption="" alt="Lloyd going shopping!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">So many tech products! It can help if you take a breath, a step back, and think about what you <em>really</em> need. We're here to help you do just that!</p></div></div><p>Often, it's good to take a step back and see what you're going to get inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p>Amazon is once again having a big site-wide sale. Even if you're not going to be buying, you should have a look.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="the-pre-black-friday-advantage-2">The Pre-Black Friday Advantage</h2><p>Another Amazon sale rolls around, flashing limited-time deals across your screen, and you feel that familiar tug-of-war. Part of you wants to dive in, but the pragmatic voice reminds you that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a> are just around the corner, promising the deepest discounts of the year. If you've decided to hold your wallet tight for the biggest shopping weekend, you might assume you should simply ignore the current sale.</p><p>This, however, is a classic shopping mistake. Even if you have zero intention of hitting the "Buy Now" button today, actively browsing Amazon's latest discount event is one of the most effective ways to arm yourself with crucial pricing intelligence for the <em>real</em> holiday shopping spree. Think of the current sale not as a primary purchasing event, but as <em>essential market research</em>—a scouting mission that will save you time and money when the November frenzy hits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-11" alt="A white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL on a latticework black chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The primary benefit of browsing now is establishing a <strong>baseline price.</strong> Too often, shoppers dive into Black Friday with only a vague idea of what an item costs.</p><p>Retailers are masters of the psychological pricing game, and a big, bold "40% OFF!" sign can easily mask a modest actual discount, especially if the product's price was recently inflated to make the sale look better. You create a tangible point of reference by tracking an item's price during a major pre-holiday sale.</p><p>For example, if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">noise-cancelling headphones</a> you covet are on sale now for $199, you know that their "normal" price is likely around $250. When Black Friday arrives, if you see them listed at $185, you immediately know it’s a genuinely better deal. If the price is $205, you can confidently hold off, knowing that the "Black Friday Special" is actually a worse offer than the earlier sale.</p><p>This is data-driven shopping at its finest, turning you from a passive consumer into an informed deal analyst. Amazon makes its money from being data-driven. You can use the same idea to save yours.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NRTPFqbNzZDAGAwck8YTbm" name="Amazon-Echo-Show-5-03.jpg" alt="Amazon Echo Show 5 (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NRTPFqbNzZDAGAwck8YTbm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, Amazon’s mid-fall sales, like its Prime-centric events, often reveal <strong>category-specific pricing trends.</strong> Different product types—from Amazon's own devices to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a>, accessories, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearables</a> follow distinct discounting patterns. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/amazon-devices-and-services-event-2022-live-blog-everything-that-is-expected-to-be-launched">Amazon devices</a> (like Echos and Fire tablets) are almost guaranteed to see significant drops now, and those prices can often serve as a ceiling for their Black Friday price. By observing this, you can predict with reasonable accuracy which <em>categories</em> will see the deepest cuts next month, allowing you to prioritize your Black Friday shopping list</p><p>The current sale also provides an invaluable look at <strong>stock and seller behaviour.</strong> Are certain popular items already selling out? If a product is consistently unavailable or constantly fluctuating in price, it signals high demand. This is critical information for Black Friday, suggesting you'll need to move fast on that particular item or category, or risk it being gone entirely. Likewise, if you see an obscure third-party seller offering a surprisingly aggressive discount, it can be a harbinger of the competitive environment to come.</p><p>I'm old enough to remember the crazy, almost violent, consumer behavior over items like Beanie Babies or the Nintendo 3DS. We buy from home now, so things can sell out even faster.</p><p>Finally, browsing now is simply a fantastic way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls?ref_=ya_d_c_lists" target="_blank">organize your wish list</a><strong>. </strong>The impulse to shop during Black Friday can lead to poor decisions or a frantic, last-minute search. By clicking around now and adding potential purchases to your "Save for Later" list, you streamline your Black Friday experience. You can then quickly compare the November deals against your noted baseline prices without being distracted by the overwhelming chaos of the main shopping weekend.</p><p>In the world of holiday shopping, knowledge is power, and data is currency. Don't let the current Amazon sale pass by unexamined. Put in the legwork now, track those prices, and you’ll find that the true value of the early sale isn't in what you buy today, but in the serious savings you’ll unlock when Black Friday officially begins. Your bank account will thank you.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-quick-links-2">Prime Big Deal Days - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It's totally up to you, but I'm certainly glad I checked T-Mobile's website before I got too excited about Prime Day.  </p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-2">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Specifically, the document the publication reported highlights the "LTE to 5G standalone transition" plans that T-Mobile has, which will reportedly occur over the next "two-plus years."</p><p>Regarding "business impact," the alleged T-Mobile plan claims its LTE contracts will not go beyond 2035, as the "LTE network will be maintained" until that year rolls around. It seems T-Mobile is expecting its LTE network to "degrade" as it puts its transition plan into action.</p><p>These issues T-Mobile anticipates include a bottleneck on its LTE network, as well as a hit to performance and service quality for phones, tablets, wearables, and more for LTE and 5G NSA (non-standalone) devices. This is also likely due to T-Mobile seemingly only looking to keep a sole 5MHz LTE channel available to the last remaining vestiges of LTE devices.</p><p>As T-Mobile moves into its 5G-only future, it states that by January 1, 2026, devices activated for its network should be 5GSA (standalone) capable, so there's no issue once its LTE spectrum is gone. Going by this report (and document), the publication assumes most of T-Mobile's transition to 5G-only will be done by 2028.</p><h2 id="a-change-in-service-2">A Change in Service</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="4ETTSfPhU6MfSiqtbJMkMb" name="tmobile5g.jpg" alt="T-Mobile coverage map" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ETTSfPhU6MfSiqtbJMkMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the root of this report is that T-Mobile is looking to finally phase out LTE support, as the publication notes, this isn't likely to affect most consumers. Devices nowadays are already capable of that 5G future, so shifting LTE out shouldn't really cause a disturbance. We'll have to see where things go with T-Mobile, such as more confirmed information from the service.</p><p>In the name of "exciting" service updates, T-Mobile's T-Satellite network recently made an announcement regarding "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile/t-satellite-android-apps-to-the-stars-satellite-ready-access-on-t-mobile">Satellite-ready</a>" apps for your phone. The T-Satellite network enables users to remain in contact with the world even without a cell connection, as it uses satellites to do its work. Now, the company is extending that support to apps users frequently use, like WhatsApp, X (Formerly Twitter), AccuWeather, and more.</p><p>Users can still check in on social media and make posts on X without a standard cell signal. For WhatsApp, users can text, send pictures, and make regular calls and video calls all on its satellite network. Satellite-ready app access started rolling out to Android and iOS devices on T-Mobile's T-Satellite network on October 1.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Notably, live translation features that eliminate language barriers in real-time are on the rise.</p><p>We've seen features debut in smartphones, earbuds, and even smart glasses. Truthfully, the idea of live translation isn't new, but it's coming into its own in 2025 thanks to improvements in support and performance. Apple recently highlighted Live Translate as a perk of its new AirPods Pro 3, and a similar feature leveraging Google Translate already existed on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>.</p><p>So, is Google's or Apple's version of live translate the best? We tried them both, and although neither is perfect, these are the key ways they compare — and which one we prefer.</p><h2 id="all-the-differences-between-apple-and-google-s-live-translate-features-2">All the differences between Apple and Google's live translate features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EhrBCszXotrftiBTQ5yUVR" name="Apple-Google-Live-Translate-1" alt="The Live Translate feature on Apple and Google hardware." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EhrBCszXotrftiBTQ5yUVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Live Translate is marketed as a unique earbud feature in 2025, but the legwork is still being done on your smartphone. To use Apple's live translation with a supported pair of AirPods, you'll need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or newer running iOS 26 or later. While it might seem like an arbitrary cutoff, an iPhone 15 Pro is needed because live translation uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/this-is-the-best-thing-about-the-the-ever-evolving-wave-of-ai-on-our-phones">Apple Intelligence</a>, which isn't available on the base iPhone 15 or older models.</p><p>This also means that Android users who own a pair of AirPods for wireless audio (yes, they do exist) won't be able to take advantage of Apple's live translation features at all. By comparison, Google's equivalent is much more forgiving. You only need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> running Android 6 or later to use live translation on a pair of Google Pixel Buds.</p><p>This includes all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Google Pixel phones</a>, but also the vast number of Android phones by other brands that meet the version requirement. You can use a pair of Google Pixel Buds with a Samsung or OnePlus phone and still use Google's live translation feature, for instance. You'll just need to ensure your phone has the latest version of the Google and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-is-about-to-tap-into-gemini-for-more-reliable-translations" target="_blank">Google Translate apps</a> installed, as both are required for live translation.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-2" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the Apple and Google implementations of live translate use off-device processing by default, so you'll need an internet connection. However, you can download languages for offline translation via the Settings app on iOS and the Google Translate app on Android.</p><p>Apple also offers an "on-device mode" that will always use offline, on-device processing for translations. However, it's worth noting that this mode only applies to the Apple Translate app, which is used for AirPods translation. If iPhone users want to translate with Siri or Safari, those translations will always be processed in the cloud.</p><p>The way you trigger live translation on Pixel Buds and AirPods is also slightly different. For Google Pixel Buds, the preferred method of using Live Translate seems to be using Google Translate on your phone and tapping <strong>Conversation mode</strong>. Alternatively, you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> to trigger live translation by saying a phrase like "<em>Hey Google, help me speak [language]</em>."</p><p>There's no way to use Conversation mode hands-free without using Google Assistant; otherwise, you'll need to pull out the Translate app on your Android phone. Apple's implementation differs slightly. You can use Siri for translation, but the preferred method is to hold down both AirPod stems to trigger live translation.</p><h2 id="do-you-need-the-latest-airpods-or-pixel-buds-to-use-them-2">Do you need the latest AirPods or Pixel Buds to use them?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zGt85NjuYy6KGMHxvrRnWR" name="Apple-Google-Live-Translate-3" alt="The Live Translate feature on Apple and Google hardware." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGt85NjuYy6KGMHxvrRnWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Apple and Google have tremendous support for live translation features, even on older devices. However, Google clearly offers an edge. It has been shipping real-time translation on earbuds since 2017, dating back to the very first pair of Google Pixel Buds. The feature has since been available on every pair released since, from the high-end Pixel Buds Pro 2 to the affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-series-review">Pixel Buds A-series</a> and new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a>.</p><p>Apple's feature is currently listed as a beta offering, so it won't be perfect. It was announced alongside the AirPods Pro 3, but it's also coming to AirPods Pro 2 and the ANC model of AirPods 4 via a software update.</p><p>So, chances are, if you have a new enough pair of Apple or Google earbuds, you'll be able to utilize live translation.</p><h2 id="are-the-airpods-pro-3-or-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-better-for-live-translation-2">Are the AirPods Pro 3 or Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 better for live translation?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tTJNQPBUj2j9cUNUfCv9zR" name="Apple-Google-Live-Translate-2" alt="The Live Translate feature on Apple and Google hardware." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tTJNQPBUj2j9cUNUfCv9zR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The aforementioned differences between calling up live translation on AirPods and Google Pixel Buds are the most impactful to the experience. It's nice to be able to walk up to someone who doesn't speak your language, hold both stems, and start hearing a translated version of their speech in your ears. There are no voice commands or smartphone taps required when using a supported AirPods and iPhone, which is ideal.</p><p>By comparison, it can be cumbersome to use clunky voice commands or pull out your phone to use Conversation mode with live translation on a pair of Google Pixel Buds. Certainly not a dealbreaker, but it's a minor inconvenience.</p><p>In terms of quality, there's still a ways to go before we're conversing at a natural pace with others between languages. The live translation features on both Apple or Google earbuds have a noticeable delay — currently necessary for processing and wireless transmission — that might impede the flow of a conversation.</p><p>Additionally, it isn't uncommon to have either feature completely miss a sentence or phrase. All it takes is someone speaking too fast, a noisy environment, or an unfamiliar dialect to throw Apple Translate or Google Translate off its game. However, it's certainly easier to use AirPods or Pixel Buds for live translation than flipping through a language phrasebook or guide.</p><p>Like almost everything leveraging AI these days: when it works, it's magical, but you can't depend on it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra users give up a bit of room for a bigger battery in favor of a siloed S Pen, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable</a> users often sacrifice camera quality for the dual displays and hinge.</p><p>In 2025, smartphone brands are emphasizing thinness and lightness as key features. It started with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/i-bought-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-but-no-one-else-did">which drew ire from Android fans</a>, and Apple took that concept to the next level with the iPhone Air, which seems to concede <em>something</em> in every area in the pursuit of a futuristic design. It's the epitome of form over function.</p><p>As a result, the iPhone Air is inherently controversial. I admittedly love thin and light phones, and using the iPhone Air for two weeks cemented that as it's much easier to handle. That said, I also agree with the iPhone Air's detractors that Apple made significant compromises to get there, and it's an incredibly niche device for that reason.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimebigdealdays%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-my-7360981637827775870-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><em><strong>Amazon Prime Day returns October 7th - see the official list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-air-pricing-availability-and-specs"><span>Apple iPhone Air: Pricing, availability, and specs</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2btLdzoK4uUKxd9jBWuTB4" name="iPhone-Air-16" alt="The back of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a wooden bench." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2btLdzoK4uUKxd9jBWuTB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone Air launched alongside the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup on Sept. 19, 2025, and is now widely available in the U.S and globally as of September 26.

It measures 5.64mm thick across much of the body, with a sloping camera plateau that stashes away the internals and a single rear camera.</p><p>The plateau appears much larger in photos than it actually feels in person. In fact, I've come to use it as a place to rest my pointer finger while holding the Air, sort of like a grip or PopSocket. It helps for stability and usability, as I can hold the iPhone Air one-handed without it slipping due to the plateau.</p><p>It's covered with glossy glass, but the main rear glass slab of the iPhone Air has a matte, frosted finish. I'm not sure I like the contrasting materials on the back, but the glossy plateau matches the polished titanium side rails. Between all the glass and titanium, the iPhone Air feels premium, possibly the <em>most</em> premium out of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/deciding-between-iphone-17-models-as-an-android-user-heres-what-to-consider">iPhone 17 lineup</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hewf9msP7VaZhRpjyRR2B4" name="iPhone-Air-8" alt="A close-up of the camera plateau of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hewf9msP7VaZhRpjyRR2B4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The colors are relatively uninspiring. The Sky Blue Air used for this review looks very similar to the Cloud White or Light Gold models. I was so unimpressed that I returned mine for Space Black, which I think is the best color.</p><p>The titanium frame, Ceramic Shield 2 glass, and IP68 protection should enhance the iPhone Air's durability. I didn't baby my Air at all, rocking it caseless and dropping it accidentally on occasion, and there was no notable wear. The material choices here should help it fare better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, which has anodized aluminum that can scratch off or scuff up over time.</p><p>An underrated feature of the iPhone Air is its weight, as the phone weighs just 165g.

You won't find any speakers, because unlike the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup, the iPhone Air <em>only</em> has an earpiece speaker.</p><p>This is understandably shocking, as we've taken stereo speakers on phones for granted in recent years. However, it's worth noting that the earpiece speaker is louder than expected, reaching a volume of around 70dB in my testing. Its volume is suitable for speaker calls, watching quick videos, or listening to a song. Quality is another matter entirely, because there's heavy distortion when the volume is set above 70%.</p><p>Even as a budding audiophile, I don't think the iPhone Air's mono speaker is a dealbreaker. It's fine in a pinch, and I can use earbuds, headphones, and proper speakers when I care about quality.

is perhaps the best upgrade this year. It's an 18MP square sensor that lets you take vertical or horizontal shots without physically rotating your phone. Additionally, the Center Stage feature can automatically crop in or move out to ensure everyone is included in the selfie. I guarantee this is a feature that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">Android phone makers are taking notice of</a>, because it's the real deal.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-air-competition"><span>Apple iPhone Air: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The iPhone Air's clear advantage over the Galaxy S25 Edge is Qi2 and MagSafe support. </strong></li><li><strong>The Galaxy S25 Edge is the well-rounded phone, with a better chip, extra camera, and more features.</strong></li></ul><p>The iPhone Air's main competition in the U.S. is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-camera-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, as they're both thin and light phones. The Air is thinner, but the Edge is lighter. The Air has MagSafe for easy midday charging, but the Edge has better performance and an ultrawide camera.

Whatever your reason, the combination of a 6.5-inch screen, 5.6mm thickness, and 165-gram weight is a market anomaly that only exists in the iPhone Air.</p><p>That said, it's true that this version of the iPhone Air will be the <em>worst </em>one to ever exist, as if an iPhone Air 2 comes out next year, it'll assuredly be better. Don't underestimate the compromises made to create the Air, either, because they're real, and they might change what you can do and how you can do it on your smartphone.</p><p>It's also true that the rumored foldable iPhone will almost certainly take cues from the Air's design. If either of those prospects excites you, perhaps you should skip the iPhone Air and wait. On the flip side, if you want a slightly thicker and more "normal" phone than the Air, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is a sleeper.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c16b02ed-53c1-417b-8889-d6d5cdaf1ac2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fmPbGHUfnJhg6TM3t6ypnW.jpg' alt="The iPhone Air in Cloud White against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Apple iPhone Air</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Thin and light</strong></em></p><p>The iPhone Air serves two main purposes: its 6.5-inch display strikes a balance between small and large phones, and its design is seriously thin and light.

For years, Samsung has been a crucial partner in building Google’s Tensor chips and modems, but that relationship is starting to look more like history.</p><p>The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-11">Pixel 11</a>, presumably powered by the Tensor G6, is shaping up to be the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Google flagship phone</a> that ditches Samsung modems entirely in favor of MediaTek.</p><p>The separation has been brewing for a while. Last year, the Tensor G5 used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10</a> series was already manufactured by TSMC instead of Samsung’s foundry, a signal that Google was considering reducing its reliance on the Korean giant. Now, with the Tensor G6, Google is apparently swapping out its Exynos-based modem.</p><p>According to Mystic Leaks on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/mysticleaks/144" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, the Tensor G6 (codenamed “Malibu”) is expected to come with MediaTek’s M90 modem. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-m90-advanced-cellular-modem-specs-detailed">M90 is no lightweight</a>: it promises 12 Gbps download speeds, dual-SIM dual-active 5G, AI-driven power optimizations, and satellite connectivity support.</p><h2 id="next-gen-performance-leap-2">Next-gen performance leap</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5035px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KXqaiSix2JfjJLxiU6WLx9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KXqaiSix2JfjJLxiU6WLx9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5035" height="2836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These features put it on par with what Samsung’s modems have been offering. Given how much modems impact battery life and signal stability, this shift could give the Pixel 11 a real advantage in areas where past models have been criticized.</p><p>This isn’t Google’s first flirtation with MediaTek. Reports suggest the company considered the same modem for the Pixel 10 but ultimately stuck with Samsung’s Exynos 5400i. With the Pixel 11, however, the switch looks much more likely, as early testing has already revealed references to the M90 in internal builds and bootloader code.</p><p>As for the Tensor G6 itself, it’s rumored to take another leap forward in manufacturing. Google is reportedly aiming for TSMC’s 2nm process node, which would put it a step ahead of competitors still relying on 3nm. That upgrade could mean up to 15% faster CPU performance and 30% better power efficiency, according to early projections.</p><p>Under the hood, the chip is expected to use a configuration of one Cortex-X930 prime core, six Cortex-A730 performance cores, and a Cortex-A530 efficiency core, paired with an Imagination triple-core GPU. On top of that, support for LPDDR5X RAM, UFS 4.0 storage, and advanced imaging pipelines will help power Google’s signature camera features and AI-heavy software.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've been using the SoundLink Plus for the last three months, and I think this is the ideal speaker in Bose's portfolio.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-soundlink-plus-review">SoundLink Plus</a> is bigger than the Flex, but it's still easily portable, and it sounds incredible. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0F7HVC62G">in at $269 on Amazon</a>, it slots right in the middle of Bose's Bluetooth speaker range, and I think it hits the sweet spot if you're looking to buy a new speaker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5018px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="SH2ryStzMtTWjUJpbsRwLh" name="Bose SoundLink Plus" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SH2ryStzMtTWjUJpbsRwLh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5018" height="2826" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who has way too many Bluetooth speakers, I'm not short on choice in this area. I usually listen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tribit-stormbox-blast-2-ultimate-bluetooth-party-speaker">Tribit StormBox Blast 2</a> and Marshall's Kilburn II, and in recent months, I used the smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/i-used-marshalls-emberton-iii-for-two-months-this-small-speaker-has-a-mighty-wallop">Emberton III</a> quite a bit. Switching to the SoundLink Plus, there's an immediate difference in the sound quality, and I like the sizing of the speaker — it isn't as heavy or unwieldy as the Blast 2, but you still get room-filling sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4902px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="8McCEAUutF2DhNpiYQSmHh" name="Bose SoundLink Plus" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8McCEAUutF2DhNpiYQSmHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4902" height="2761" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The design of the SoundLink Plus is similar to its siblings, and while I got the black color model, Bose sells the speaker in blue and yellow if you need something that stands out visually. There's a nylon carrying handle on the side, and at 3.3lb, the SoundLink Plus isn't too heavy; it's easy enough to take this thing anywhere.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YtVkdDKi8xpbi8BdSStqJh" name="Bose SoundLink Plus" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YtVkdDKi8xpbi8BdSStqJh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, the SoundLink Plus gets IP67 dust and water resistance, making it ideal for use at the pool or the beach. The chassis itself is made out of polycarbonate, and the top and sides are made out of silicone, making it easy to clean. It charges via USB-C, and there isn't any fast charging; it takes just over five hours to charge the internal battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NPnzcaC44SucuH39ZjyMdh" name="Bose SoundLink Plus" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPnzcaC44SucuH39ZjyMdh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are built-in controls at the top, and you can adjust music playback, adjust the volume, and pair with a phone or tablet with relative ease.

It produces a vibrant sound with booming bass, clean mids, and good treble extension. Yes, most Bluetooth speakers sound great these days, but where the SoundLink Plus stands out is the sheer quality; it outmatches its immediate rivals to a considerable extent.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4871px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Kruftt82qHXMtGpVHtDWQh" name="Bose SoundLink Plus" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kruftt82qHXMtGpVHtDWQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4871" height="2744" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life is pretty good too, with the speaker managing to last close to 20 hours between charges. While I'm annoyed that there's no fast charging, this isn't the kind of device that you'll need to charge regularly. The only other omission is the missing mic — you can't take calls on this thing.</p><p>Other than that, I don't really have any issues with the SoundLink Plus. It does everything I need in a Bluetooth speaker, it's easy to take anywhere, and the sound quality is much better than other speakers in the same category.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7d191f0e-f85e-4261-9c56-3b0b64533991">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JbzspPHwf5rmdhugy4A2WK.jpg' alt="Bose SoundLink Plus in Citrus Yellow"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Bose SoundLink Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The SoundLink Plus looks good, sounds great, and is designed to be used anywhere.

If anything, most brands have pivoted to AI as being the cornerstone of their products, with Honor going all-in with its Alpha Plan. I'm still not convinced that AI-assisted features on phones are useful (at least to my requirements), and if you're of a similar mind, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-deactivate-ai-on-your-android-phone">deactivate AI entirely on your phone</a>.</p><p>But if you're willing to try out phone-based AI, there's no shortage of features available. Most brands have partnered with Google to pre-install Gemini on their devices, and they have their own suite of utilities as a differentiator. Samsung bundles its AI offerings into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, and given the scale of the brand's reach, its features get the most mainstream usage.</p><p>Chinese brands aren't shying away from integrating AI into their phones, and Honor is ahead of its rivals in this regard. Honor AI combines a suite of utilities, from AI-assisted translation and transcribing to image editing, and intent-based interactions. Having used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Magic V5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> extensively in the last two months, I decided to pit both manufacturers' AI offerings against each other, and see which one comes out ahead.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ai-vs-honor-ai-what-features-are-available-2">Galaxy AI vs. Honor AI: What features are available?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5122px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KQbQmTdNuzPugg2CJwNw55" name="Honor Magic V5" alt="Honor Magic V5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KQbQmTdNuzPugg2CJwNw55.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5122" height="2885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has an extensive selection of AI tools, with 11 available: Call Assist, Writing Assist, Interpreter, Note Assist, Transcript Assist, Browsing Assist, Photo Assist, Drawing Assist, Audio Eraser, Now Brief, and Health Assist. What I like about Samsung's implementation is that most features can be toggled to use on-device models exclusively, ensuring your data doesn't go to a cloud server.</p><p>Honor has eight AI utilities not including the image editing features: Magic Sidebar, AI Deepfake Detection, Magic Text, Magic Portal, AI Subtitles, AI Translate, Call Translation, and AI Writing.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ai-vs-honor-ai-translation-and-contextual-services-2">Galaxy AI vs. Honor AI: Translation and contextual services</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9EvtFQDoc5yYq6nmjzcSWT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-17" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9EvtFQDoc5yYq6nmjzcSWT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The defining AI feature is Magic Portal, which the brand calls intent-based AI. Basically, it changes context according to the situation; if you've selected text, it pulls up a list of messaging apps where you can paste that text with ease. Similarly, pressing and holding an image surfaces Instagram, X, and other social media apps, making it easier to share content.</p><p>Honor says the goal is to simplify how you use your phone, and Magic Portal ties in with Google apps to provide contextual info. I use it predominantly to add a location to Google Maps to navigate, and to paste text between messaging clients. I use Magic Text quite a bit as well, with the utility able to extract text from images.</p><p>Honor's AI Writing and Samsung's Writing Assist fulfil similar roles, but I found Writing Assist to be better at summarizing long-form articles. You also get additional options when it comes to polishing text, and it has built-in chat translation as well. You miss out on summarization if you use on-device processing with Writing Assist, and Honor doesn't even have that option.</p><p>AI Subtitles is a nifty addition on Honor phones that generates subtitles in a real-time when a video is playing. It is is quite good at transcribing content on-the-fly and creating subtitles, and you can save the generated text. Accuracy is hit-and-miss based on the language you select, but I haven't had issues using these tools with English.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gozi9uemwzgkeZLP6qKEv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-20" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Galaxy AI image generation hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gozi9uemwzgkeZLP6qKEv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Honor and Samsung have an AI-based interpreter, and they're just as effective. I talked in Hindi, and both utilities did a decent job translating in real-time to English. Both brands have a call-assist feature as well, and Samsung has the edge in this regard. When using Hindi to English, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 did a better job translating in real-time, and you can use it in several messaging services, including Meet and Telegram.</p><p>Samsung's Browsing Assist is definitely handy, as it lets you summarize web content with relative ease. Similarly, Now Brief suggests contextual content based on time of day, and it's more useful than I thought — it's a decent alternative to Google's At A Glance widget.</p><p>When it comes to writing and real-time translation, Samsung just gives you more in the way of utilities, and I prefer using Galaxy AI to Honor AI in this regard.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ai-vs-honor-ai-image-editing-2">Galaxy AI vs. Honor AI: Image editing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XMStVceEZGKPC2EMxWris3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-22" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XMStVceEZGKPC2EMxWris3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both brands have generative image editing, and Samsung's Sketch to Image and Portrait Studio are plenty to fun to use. But when it comes to image editing, Honor's AI Eraser does a much better job than Generative Edit on Samsung phones. While editing photos I took in London, Honor's utility provided edits that looked more realistic, doing a great job taking out background elements and filling in the details.</p><p>Honor's AI Upscale and AI Cutout also do a standout job, but it's AI Outpainting that I like the most. The feature basically lets you expand the canvas considerably, and it is astoundingly good. I rely on this feature extensively, and it makes a genuine difference — and it's effortless to use. Honor also has an image-to-video feature on select models that uses Google's Veo 2 image engine, and it's fantastic.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ai-vs-honor-ai-the-bottom-line-2">Galaxy AI vs. Honor AI: The bottom line</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5040px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="u372Yh3RowF9VsKcvsnsE4" name="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Honor Magic V5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Honor Magic V5 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u372Yh3RowF9VsKcvsnsE4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5040" height="2839" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Samsung and Honor have their strengths and weaknesses. If you need writing or real-time translation features, Galaxy AI has a definite edge over what Honor is offering. But if you rely on image editing and want to turn images to videos, Honor is unmatched in this area.</p><p>While Samsung doesn't offer quite as many features when it comes to image editing, it does a decent enough job in its own right. While AI isn't the differentiator when it comes to choosing between these two brands, the upgrades to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 make it a clear frontrunner against the Magic V5, so if you're looking to get a new phone this year and are considering foldables, the Z Fold 7 would be my recommendation.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fefb8cf5-0c48-42d6-8b75-cae91840c962">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHR4D74gywDog26AHRpRkG.jpg' alt="An official product render of the blue Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is my favorite foldable; it has a thin design, fantastic cameras, decent battery, and one of the best AI-based utilities around. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

However, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-labs-wants-you-to-test-the-future-of-ai-starting-with-music">YouTube Labs</a>, it's now the testbed for a new AI feature that brings AI hosts to the music listening experience.</p><p>It's not unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-ai-dj-curated-music">Spotify's AI DJ</a>, which features an AI-generated host that talks between songs to provide commentary or context for upcoming tracks. Except for YouTube Music, there are two AI hosts that converse with each other as part of a "radio show" called Beyond the Beat.</p><p>To some, this might sound annoying; after all, who would want some AI-generated voices interrupting their listening experience? However, I've found that I don't actually hate this new feature, and I hope it sticks around, with some changes.</p><h2 id="diving-into-my-favorite-songs-2">Diving into my favorite songs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vG9DF8AGbGzcVZmZ8sniwf" name="YouTube-Music-Lifestyle-01.jpg" alt="YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vG9DF8AGbGzcVZmZ8sniwf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the Beat sneaks its way into your listening experience every few songs, with the two AI-generated hosts, Mo and Flow, chatting about the song that just played and/or the upcoming song. The first time you enable the feature, they'll even introduce themselves after the first listen to let you know that they are, in fact, AI, and that they can get some things wrong.</p><p>However, despite being AI, they actually have surprisingly great chemistry and ooze personality. The conversations flow pretty seamlessly between these two, and if you didn't know they were AI, you might think they were actual radio hosts.</p><p>Like Spotify's AI DJ, they'll only interject every so often, and when they do, it'll last for less than a minute, usually around 40 seconds. Usually, the conversations provide context to a song, such as backstory or trivia, and I actually find much of the commentary pretty fascinating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6" name="youtube-music-hero.jpg" alt="youtube music hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first time "Beyond the Beat" came on, the hosts discussed how the song "Yours" by Mariah Carey was initially intended as a duet with Justin Timberlake, but contractual complications resulted in only a solo version being released.

It's wild how much technology has influenced even my baby's first words.</p><p>Times are changing rapidly, and I'm constantly playing catch-up with how quickly AI has infiltrated my toddler's life, even though he doesn't fully understand what it means. As someone who's trying to raise her child without screen time until he goes to school, I totally forgot about the home speakers we're always talking to and the role they play in our lives.</p><h2 id="google-assistant-doubles-as-a-digital-nanny-2">Google Assistant doubles as a digital nanny</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nnGfTipg5vAPY2CBVHGCEL" name="Baby-watching-the-screen" alt="Baby watching the blank screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nnGfTipg5vAPY2CBVHGCEL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At first, it didn't bother me as much, but I did<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thebump.com/news/baby-first-word-google-tweet"> some digging</a> and found out that I wasn't the only one seeking Google's help. Whether it was to soothe a fussy baby, distract him from something he couldn't have, or even for an impromptu dance party during lunchtime, Google Assistant had been this invisible presence, getting us through those moments when our hands were literally full.</p><p>Both my Sony Bravia OLED TV and Bose soundbar are Google-integrated. Just last week, when our TV remote went missing, we were left to navigate the TV purely by voice commands. So for a week, my life basically revolved around saying things like, "Hey Google, can you play 'Burning Ghat' by Rishab Sharma on YouTube" when my toddler wouldn't stop crying, asking about the weather before a walk, or even adjusting the TV volume to "15%" while juggling a million other things.</p><p>So, when he watches me talk to thin air, anytime I say "Hey Google," he looks at the TV, as if it's going to answer back (which it does), and is captivated by this invisible person who magically controls things around the house.</p><h2 id="parenting-in-the-age-of-ai-powered-digital-assistants-2">Parenting in the age of AI powered Digital assistants </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1305px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aNm6rwnACEjtCPxC5urSce" name="amazon-2025-echo-series-ai-alexa-hero" alt="The 2025 Amazon Echo series launch, featuring the new Dot Max and the latest Show 8 and Show 11." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aNm6rwnACEjtCPxC5urSce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1305" height="734" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To put things in perspective, many parents unknowingly reach for a digital assistant like Google, Siri, or Alexa due to the sheer convenience of using a simple voice command to summon it.

While this study was conducted six years ago, the number will likely be much higher today, considering every other appliance in the house is trying to "outsmart" one another, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker">smart speakers</a> to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/you-can-play-retro-games-on-practically-anything"> voice-enabled TVs</a>, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eufy.com/ca/products/t2351111?variant=43005811294373">vacuum cleaners</a>.</p><p>While these AI-enabled devices actually help save me from a possible meltdown,  I sometimes worry they might intrude on those private bonding moments with my baby, especially when he learns to summon Google himself. However, I don't think there's an escape, as big tech companies are making their AI chat assistants sound increasingly human, complete with a distinct personality.</p><h2 id="humanizing-ai-voices-2">Humanizing AI voices</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA" name="google-nest-mini-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Nest Mini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Big tech companies carefully research and design AI voices to be neutral, calm, and non-threatening. However, that's taken a step further with some companies trying to tap actors like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-trying-to-steal-scarlett-johanssons-voice-to-make-ai-feel-comfortable-is-the-reason-why-its-so-worrying">Scarlett Johansson to use their voice for</a> AI assistants (remember, she was the voice of the AI in the film "Her").</p><p>Google assigned a team to develop a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://synpost.synup.com/history-and-future-of-voice-search-google/#:~:text=And%20what%20was%20more%2C%20the,haven't%20watch%20this%20before.">"little more of a personality"</a> for the Assistant, ensuring the voice sounds friendly, approachable, and trustworthy —qualities that are also inherent in human beings. This leads me to my point of how my now one-year-old might perceive this voice in the cloud, talking back to him. Does he see it as a family member, or just a large, rectangular bar that has come to life?</p><p>So, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-sued-for-allegedly-contributing-to-teen-suicide">we need to teach our kids early on</a> how to distinguish between genuine conversations and superficial chats. Much like Android Central Senior Editor Nick Sutrich's son, who uses a Google Nest speaker for funny questions and setting timers (which is mostly what the family uses it for, too).</p><p>Sutrich tells me, "I do remember we ingrained in him (when they first got the speaker) that Google isn't smart and it's not a person. Whatever answers it gives you are not the truth and may often be quite wrong, so it's fine to ask it a question, but always check with a person before trusting it."</p><h2 id="the-way-forward-2">The way forward</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZF4DmAcpPR9hF76uZEPQak" name="amazon-echo-4th-gen-lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="Amazon Echo 4th Gen Lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZF4DmAcpPR9hF76uZEPQak.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, I'm only going to lose if I try to raise my child in an AI-free home, since Google and Amazon have both now launched new AI-powered speakers that already recognize different household voices, understand content, and sync with other devices. And as IDC's Research Manager,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/exclusive-how-google-and-amazon-are-making-your-smart-home-truly-intelligent"> Jitesh Ubrani notes</a>, these devices are not just assistants anymore; they're actively shaping a new, smarter home.</p><p>For parents, this means the real challenge isn't completely shutting out AI, but rather raising kids who are tech-savvy, yet also understand when to reach out for a human connection rather than relying on a machine for answers to life's questions. So maybe my son's "Hey, Google" isn't a bad thing after all. It is a constant reminder that technology is advancing rapidly, and it's up to us to ensure our kids can keep pace with it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This Ray-Ban Meta glasses guide will run through the key features, settings, tips, and tricks you should know!</p><p>While we'll focus mainly on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> glasses, we'll also touch on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> glasses with their exclusive tricks. Plus, we'll talk about the features that'll launch alongside or after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> glasses in late October, such as Garmin integration and saved shortcuts to skip "Hey Meta" commands.</p><p>Let's dive into every key Meta smart glasses feature and how to use them, from Live Translation and Live AI to activating connected apps!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-ai-features-and-settings"><span>Meta AI features and settings</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kNRXoz3DqhJmGsKkxoGq2H" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-meta-ai-app-resolution-options" alt="Changing the video recording resolution on Oakley Meta HSTN Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNRXoz3DqhJmGsKkxoGq2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta has a convenient <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/ai-glasses/977597606858973/" target="_blank">FAQ page</a> listing some sample Meta AI commands, including calling or messaging a contact, asking how much battery is left, or going to the "Next" song in your playlist — all fairly standard commands for any AI assistant.</p><p>What's unique to these smart glasses is asking Meta AI to "tell me about X," such as a plant or landmark, to <strong>summarize</strong> an article in front of you, <strong>translate</strong> a sign to your language, or <strong>remember</strong> this hotel room number.</p><p>When it comes to Meta AI <strong>reminders</strong>, you can tell Meta to remember where you parked or that you have an appointment on Thursday; any dated or timed reminders will send a push notification to your phone. Alternatively, you can simply ask Meta AI, "What are my upcoming reminders?" If you enable location tracking, you'll be able to see exactly where you created a reminder, which may help you locate what you're looking for.</p><p>You can also <strong>set timers</strong> using Meta AI, which will appear in the Meta AI app. You can ask the AI for your time remaining and edit it if necessary.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J6y4FYWdWduw9eBsz4YzMJ" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-charging-app-01" alt="Looking at the battery life for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the Meta AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6y4FYWdWduw9eBsz4YzMJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the Devices tab of the Meta AI app, tap the <strong>cog icon</strong> next to your glasses, then the <strong>Meta AI settings</strong>. Under <strong>Language and voice</strong>, you'll find low, medium, or high-pitched voice options, as well as AI voices for Awkwafina, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. You may find these cool or uncanny; I find it more useful to switch the <strong>Speaking rate</strong> to 1.25X so that I'm not waiting as long to get a response to my questions.</p><p>By default, your glasses are always listening for a "Hey Meta" command. If you want to conserve battery life, you can go into your <strong>device settings > Meta AI > "Hey Meta" preferences</strong> to turn this feature off. You can then summon Meta AI by tapping and holding the touchpad instead.</p><p>If you leave "Hey Meta" on, double-check that <strong>Respond without "Hey Meta" </strong>is toggled as well. You'll still have to say the wake word once, but after Meta AI answers, it'll listen for a reply for about five seconds. So if you asked about the Lincoln Memorial in front of you, you could follow up with "When did he die?" and have Meta understand who "he" is from context.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-live-ai"><span>Live AI</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FUQBYtcKssnyUTHYUer6MQ" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-smart-glasses-skyler-photo-1" alt="A photo of a model wearing Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses in the Skyler Shiny Chalky Gray style" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUQBYtcKssnyUTHYUer6MQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Say "Hey Meta, start Live AI," and the assistant will activate your mic and camera continuously until you end the session; you can then ask as many questions as you'd like without the "Hey Meta" wake word. It drains your battery quickly — the new Oakley HSTNs and Ray-Ban Gen 2s might last an hour in this mode — but it's very convenient for in-depth conversations.</p><p>Meta recommends using it for tasks such as meal preparation, fashion advice, or contextual information about a landmark or museum exhibit, particularly when discussing a single topic in depth or seeking context for multiple visual subjects.</p><p>You can say "Pause Live AI" or tap the touchpad to temporarily disable the mic and cameras, such as when someone sees the notification light and asks you to stop. Then say, "Hey Meta, resume Live AI" or tap the touchpad again to restart. Remember to say "Stop Live AI" at the end to preserve your battery life.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-be-my-eyes"><span>Be My Eyes</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HvfH33QbwTB5Pp3gwHNSRB" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-wearing-01" alt="Wearing a pair of limited edition warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with 24K Prizm lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HvfH33QbwTB5Pp3gwHNSRB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the coolest spin-offs of the Live AI feature is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/be-my-eyes-smartglasses/"><strong>Be My Eyes</strong></a>. Blind or low-vision owners of Ray-Ban Meta glasses can contact a volunteer and share their camera and mic feed with that person; they'll be able to essentially see for that person and guide them through that environment.</p><p>Even if you can't or don't want to rely on someone else's help, you can always simply ask Meta AI, "What am I looking at?" and get help; that's why Live AI can be helpful, to get continuous support if you're going to be repeating the question.</p><p>Meta doesn't want people using these glasses as a dedicated mobility aid, due to the potential for inaccurate information. However, if you activate the <strong>Detailed responses</strong> feature, Meta AI responses will include more information on the "placement of doorways, people, and objects, as well as quantity of objects," providing low-vision users with the context they need.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-live-translation"><span>Live Translation</span></h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/487r7q9Et5g" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Meta glasses can live-translate between English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish, but you have to do some setup first. In the <strong>Devices</strong> tab, tap the <strong>Translate</strong> button under your glasses. Then select which language you expect the other person to be speaking, as well as what "You speak." Meta will then download the necessary language pack(s).</p><p>Once that's set up, face the person you'll be speaking with and place the phone between the two of you. Then say, "Hey Meta, start live translation." Meta recommends that you speak clearly and at a "modest" pace so that the AI has no trouble translating your words. Whatever you say will be transcribed on your phone, while what the other person says will be spoken aloud over your glasses' speakers.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-connected-apps"><span>Connected apps</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BUGhas76oHZsfAVMaujh5B" name="oakley-meta-hstn-youtube-music" alt="Streaming YouTube Music on a pair of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BUGhas76oHZsfAVMaujh5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once you grant permissions, your Ray-Ban or Oakley Meta glasses can sync with:</p><ul><li>Phone apps (iOS and Android)</li><li>Messaging apps (Apple Messages, Google Messages, Messenger, WhatsApp)</li><li>Social apps (Facebook, Instagram)</li><li>Music/podcast apps (Amazon Music, Apple Music, Audible, Calm, iHeart, Shazam, Spotify)</li><li>Calendar apps (Google Calendar, Outlook)</li></ul><p>When using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android" target="_blank">music apps</a> or answering calls, it's a good idea to memorize the <strong>touchpad shortcuts</strong>. A <strong>single tap</strong> will pause or restart a song; a <strong>double-tap</strong> will skip to the next song or answer a phone call; a <strong>triple-tap</strong> will return to the previous song; a <strong>tap-and-hold</strong> will reject a call or trigger your music app to start playing if you assign that shortcut to it instead of Meta AI. <strong>Swiping up or down</strong> will increase or decrease the volume.</p><p>When it comes to calls and messaging, it's as simple as sharing your contacts with Meta so you can say, "Hey Meta, call Bob" or "send a message to Bob." If you connect multiple apps, you may need to add "on WhatsApp" or "on Messenger" at the end of the command.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GdRiG33v2ANhCApnn9TGKk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-messaging" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing text messaging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GdRiG33v2ANhCApnn9TGKk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta unsurprisingly saves its best tools for its own apps, where it can use direct integration instead of basic commands. For example, you can <strong>record a voice message</strong> (up to one minute), but only through WhatsApp or Messenger. Likewise, you can <strong>share your glasses camera feed</strong> during a video call, but only by tapping a glasses icon in Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram.</p><p>When you take photos with your glasses, you can say, "Hey Meta, share my last photo to Facebook/Instagram," or you can specify to share it "to my Instagram/Facebook Story."</p><p>Meta will continue to add new app connections over time, as well as better commands for specific apps; you can bookmark the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/ai-glasses/1809764829519902/">Meta AI glasses release notes</a> to see the most recent updates.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-upcoming-vanguard-features"><span>Upcoming Vanguard features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="meZASeH7vZMVRJQTSHwMQE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-and-Garmin-Venu-X1" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses and Garmin Venu X1 smartwatch sitting on a wooden board together." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/meZASeH7vZMVRJQTSHwMQE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta has confirmed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-and-meta-team-up-on-new-smart-glasses-for-athletes">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> will launch on October 21, featuring a few fitness-focused AI and camera features, and that these features will eventually be available on other Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses.</p><p>First, Meta has teamed up with Garmin and Strava to <strong>sync your live workout activities</strong> with your glasses. You'll be able to ask, "What's my current pace?" and have the glasses deliver that information from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> or Strava app. You'll be able to check info without breaking stride to swipe through watch menus or pull your phone out of your pocket.</p><p>Second, Meta's <strong>autocapture feature</strong> will "automatically capture video clips when you hit key distance milestones or ramp up your heart rate, speed, or elevation," creating memories from a race without having to take them manually.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BWfZmteW2MPX4ssMAMAdH" name="oakley-meta-vanguard-official-lifestyle-01" alt="An official lifestyle image of a person wearing Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BWfZmteW2MPX4ssMAMAdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Third, Meta will add <strong>new video modes</strong> beyond the current 1080p or 3K recording settings. Specifically, you'll be able to create <strong>Slow Motion</strong> videos for dramatic extreme sports moments or <strong>Hyperlapse</strong> videos for extended tours of your activity route. The Vanguard glasses will have a second Action button that you can use to set up your video shortcut of choice.</p><p>Meta also told us that it'll create new <strong>single-word shortcuts</strong> sometime before the end of 2025. For example, instead of "Hey Meta, capture a photo," you'll simply say "Photo," and the always-listening assistant will do the rest. Meta will be the one to choose which shortcuts work, but it'll still be appreciated to trigger actions more quickly.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-ray-ban-display-features"><span>Meta Ray-Ban Display features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4NSfiFEdgymW9EkVKzMkSk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-recipe-tomato" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing a Meta AI prompt about a tomato recipe" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4NSfiFEdgymW9EkVKzMkSk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> build on the smart glasses template, adding a built-in display. Most of the features on them are comparable, but with upgrades enabled by the HUD, such as the ability to see Meta AI responses in addition to hearing them, including images or (if relevant) step-by-step instructions in your vision, which you can then swipe through with Meta Neural Band gesture controls.</p><p>Taking photos with normal Ray-Ban/Oakley glasses is challenging because you don't know how close you need to be. The Display glasses solve this with a <strong>viewfinder</strong> previewing your shot, with the ability to <strong>zoom</strong> in or out by twisting your fingers. Plus, if you're into generative AI silliness, you can look at your finished shot and <strong>restyle</strong> it based on a text prompt before you upload it to social media.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-navigation" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing turn-by-turn navigation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you use Meta AI to look for something nearby, the Display glasses support <strong>pedestrian navigation</strong> to guide you to your destination, though only in "select cities" to start.</p><p>Meta smart glasses can show your perspective in a video call, but only the Display glasses can have it both ways, showing the person you're calling in your vision. You also get a full view of other apps, such as your Instagram feed, for scrolling through videos without it being visible to anyone else in the room.</p><p>Likewise, you can skip through a music playlist on smart glasses, but only the Display glasses will show the details and album artwork, so there's no suspense of what's coming next.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-live-captions" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing live captions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the best Meta Ray-Ban Display features is <strong>Live Captions</strong>, which transcribes in real time what the person in front of you is saying. The glasses' multi-array mics pinpoint who you're looking at so that any other conversations around you don't mess up the captions; if you turn to look at someone else, the text will switch to whatever they're saying.</p><p>The glasses will also enhance <strong>Live Translations</strong> so that you see people's translated responses in text form, as well as audibly.</p><p>Most Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses features are controlled by simple gestures or voice commands. One feature, currently in beta but coming to them soon, is the ability to <strong>write words on a desk or thigh</strong> and have them transcribed for a message or command; this will allow you to use the glasses silently and subtly during a meeting.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung jumping in earlier is expected to tighten the gap between Galaxy users and Pixel owners when it comes to getting new Android features.</p><p>Early signs of this change appeared in a leaked firmware build with SDK version 36.1 and the build prefix BP4A, both linked to Android 16 QPR2. This points to Samsung syncing its update schedule more closely with Google.</p><h2 id="google-s-trunk-stable-model-enables-the-shift-2">Google’s Trunk Stable model enables the shift</h2><p>A big part of that is thanks to Google’s Trunk Stable model, a framework that allows OEMs to integrate Android changes faster and with fewer headaches, as per Rahman. If Samsung sticks with this path, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">favorite Galaxy phones</a> could start getting Android’s newest tools without months of waiting around.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1235px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.45%;"><img id="ziRCzrVZ4gM6ScLpDdykCZ" name="One-UI-8.5-new-features" alt="new features spotted in One UI 8.5 builds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ziRCzrVZ4gM6ScLpDdykCZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1235" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1235px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.45%;"><img id="e8iPcphrR4njNRT7omAaEZ" name="One-UI-8.5-new-features" alt="new features spotted in One UI 8.5 builds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8iPcphrR4njNRT7omAaEZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1235" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>So, what’s in the pipeline with One UI 8.5? Quite a bit. On the interface side, users can expect an expanded dark theme, a forced icon theming option, lock screen widget support, and a universal cursor when using external displays. There’s also more granular control over haptic feedback and better APIs to adjust app layouts across different devices.</p><p>For media, Samsung is bringing in improvements like new AAudio APIs, an HDR/SDR brightness slider, enhanced media router privacy, and personal audio sharing via the output switcher.</p><p>Privacy and security get some key updates too. One UI 8.5 is expected to extend Identity Check to more apps, not just system features, while also adding USB-level protection, local parental controls, and toggles for phone theft protection.</p><p>It’s worth noting that not every feature spotted in this leaked build is guaranteed to make it into the final release. Still, the overall takeaway is that One UI 8.5 could be Samsung making a statement that it’s ready to deliver Android improvements faster, without leaving Galaxy users waiting until Android 17.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The TPU material is flexible and elicits a wonderful tactile feel. That slight bit of squishiness makes it easier to hold your phone and helps soften the corners for comfort. The side rails of the case have a lovely etched texture that adds additional grip, as well.</p><p>The button covers are also engraved with their functions and sport a different texture from the sides. That makes them easy to identify and also makes it less common to accidentally press the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/how-use-nothing-essential-space">Essential Space</a> key.

I've used cases that have annoyingly high edge lips, and it makes them uncomfortable to use, especially if you like gesture navigation.</p><p>Since they're flexible, they're also easy to install and remove if you like to swap out cases regularly. These have an anti-yellowing component inside, too, so they don't age like an old SNES.

Each company has its own implementation of AI, from Samsung to Motorola or OnePlus, but even so, there are some experiences, such as Gemini and Circle to Search, that are more or less the same on many Android phones.</p><p>Thanks to Google, these two functions, which are arguably my favorite AI features on any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, are easily accessible from the bottom of my phone display and from nearly any screen. Sure, Motorola gets an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">AI key</a> and Samsung opts for the power button, but these options are inferior in different ways.</p><p>And while I wish Google would adopt a separate AI button for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>, the near-universal experience of these two features has made them invaluable aspects of my smartphone experience.</p><h2 id="a-swipe-or-long-press-is-all-you-need-2">A swipe or long-press is all you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AzdiKJuWXQabj3TF3Frn7M" name="Circle-to-Search.jpg" alt="Google's circle to search scanning a barcode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AzdiKJuWXQabj3TF3Frn7M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It wasn't until recently that I realized just how important the bottom of my phone screen had become.

It captures whatever is on your screen at that moment and lets you initiate a search, allowing you to quickly and easily find answers about whatever you're looking at. You can also search for a song that you hear, select and copy text on the fly, or even quickly translate text.</p><p>I actually find myself using the latter option frequently, and it is probably my most commonly used function. Circle to Search is essentially a more accessible version of Google Lens and is easily a favorite among the Android Central staff.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4130px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="9GHscX5VhUdW4qJeiz2BwL" name="Assistant-swipe-gesture" alt="Swipe to invoke assistant gesture on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9GHscX5VhUdW4qJeiz2BwL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4130" height="2322" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's Gemini and what I feel is its lesser-known shortcut. Essentially, you can swipe from the bottom corner of the screen to trigger the AI assistant, which feels incredibly intuitive and, to me, much more natural than the default long-press of the power button.</p><p>Here's how you can enable this on your phone, at least for some of the major brands in North America:</p><ul><li><strong>Pixel</strong>: Settings > System > Navigation mode > Gesture navigation settings > Swipe to invoke assistant.</li><li><strong>Motorola</strong>: Settings > Gestures > System navigation > Gesture navigation settings > Swipe for Assistant.</li><li><strong>OnePlus</strong>: Settings > System & update > System navigation > Gestures > Digital Assistant from Google.</li></ul><p>You'll notice that one particular brand is missing.

In fact, it was its removal that made me realize just how much I relied on it, especially since one of the first things I do when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-samsung-galaxy-phone-first-things">setting up a new Samsung phone</a> is switch the power button back to power controls.</p><p>Using the power button to trigger the assistant never made much sense to me. It changes the method of turning the phone off, requiring you to simultaneously press and hold both the power button and the volume up button. This doesn't feel intuitive at all, and I question why OEMs have started making this the default.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZJJVz5vaBEyU9R8cjLBWd4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-S25-Plus-and-S25-camera-islands-03" alt="Looking at the raised camera lenses on the back of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZJJVz5vaBEyU9R8cjLBWd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Without the swipe gesture, I <em>could </em>always use the back tap option, but I prefer to reserve that for quick screenshots. You can obviously trigger the AI assistant by voice, which isn't always appropriate, or simply tap the app or widget icon, which isn't as convenient since I would have to exit the current screen.</p><p>The other option is to use the One Hand Operation Plus in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>. With this module, you can create a new handle with the option to open an "Assistance app" by swiping diagonally. It's not quite the same, since the swipe has to originate from the side of the screen and not the bottom corner (you can only adjust the gesture position so low on your display). This could clash with the back gesture, but it's currently the closest workaround.</p><p>Otherwise, you can always insert Gemini into the Edge Panel, which is accessible from nearly any screen, although it's not as seamless, since it requires a swipe and tap.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4130px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wY2jdTqeQLS22dYtwEvSDL" name="Good-Lock-One-Hand-Operation-Plus" alt="Good Lock One Hand Operation Plus module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wY2jdTqeQLS22dYtwEvSDL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4130" height="2323" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I really enjoyed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> and find One UI 8 to be excellent, I'm not sure why Samsung removed the swipe gesture from its phones. I have reached out to Samsung for an explanation, but I have yet to receive a response. I'll update this article when I hear back.</p><h2 id="ease-of-use-with-ease-of-access-2">Ease of use with ease of access</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it seems like AI is finally beginning to settle somewhat as a part of everyday life, there's no question that consumers are still overwhelmed. Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-and-qualcomm-finally-realize-what-ai-is-for">told me in a recent interview</a> that "consumers are still pretty wary of AI," explaining that the people who find value in it are believers.</p><p>"I also think that AI is a black box for a lot of people, and they really don't understand how it works at all."</p><p>I believe that one way to help normalize AI is to make certain features more easily accessible. Gemini and Circle to Search have quickly become staples of the Android experience, as Google continues to improve them with features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/circle-to-search-gains-real-time-translation">streamlined translation</a>. Linking them with gestures that consumers can easily remember is a major step toward making them more comfortable with AI, although I believe they shouldn't clash with functions many are already accustomed to (i.e., the power button).</p><p>Fortunately, Android is all about choice. Given the bevy of options available, which gestures do you like to use to evoke your favorite AI assistant?</p> ]]></dc:content>

Network optimization can be handled on the fly using predictive algorithms, allowing for better, faster connections.</p><p><strong>AI powers the apps you use, the services they need to work, the battery that powers them, and how secure it is once thrown together</strong>. Google Play Services, the toolkit that enables most phones to run most apps, features a neat utility called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/android/play_services" target="_blank">LiteRT within</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/android/play_services" target="_blank"> Google Play Services</a>.

Machine Learning manages system resources, making sure the right processor is doing the right things for optimal performance. Algorithms even predict when and how you'll perform a specific task and pre-allocate the right resources at the right time, so it goes off without a hitch.</p><p><strong>AI helps you use your phone to communicate</strong>. Autocorrect on your keyboard, visual voicemail, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/google-expands-scam-detection-feature-to-pixel-watch-3-and-watch-2">spam detection</a>, and voice-to-text (and vice versa) are all powered by an AI component so that they can better recognize what's correct versus what's not and offer an improved experience.</p><p>Finally, and maybe most importantly, <strong>AI monitors your phone for threatening behavior, offering better security</strong>. A lot is going on behind the screen you're looking at. It could be easy to sneak something through if the system wasn't watching for everything and anything. Active threat detection means it doesn't need to know what it's seeing to know something bad is happening, and can put a stop to it.</p><h2 id="one-more-thing-2">One more thing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q7xeedTTpHpg7oqnRbB7bK" name="Photo Sphere returns to Pixel phones - hero.jpg" alt="A man holding up the Pixel 7 with the back of the camera in view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q7xeedTTpHpg7oqnRbB7bK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the AI that's happening whether you like it or not, because it's required for a modern version of Android and most operating systems. Really, it mostly does a great job at it. If the phone you use today seems better than the phone you had five years ago, AI is a big part of the reason why.</p><p>There's also one more AI-dependent thing you probably do a lot of and never think about: <strong>use your camera</strong>.</p><p>I don't mean <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">generative AI tricks and tools</a>, either. Without AI, your phone can not turn what the camera lens sees into a photograph you can save. Hardware makers use AI at the most basic level to balance color data and light levels for each individual pixel of information. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-how-does-a-tiny-smartphone-camera-take-such-good-photos" target="_blank">camera software inside your device</a> is essentially a sophisticated AI-Picasso that has been trained to take a set of numbers and transform them into a photo.</p><p>Low-light photos, moving photos, and taking pictures of kids or dogs running fast are all made possible by AI, which decides what you think will look good. On your phone, the camera system is simply running and capturing light. It takes "smart" software to determine which parts are what you want to see.</p><p>Even if you never ever open <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a>, ask Google Search a question, or use software to make funny meme pictures, you're constantly using AI to do most everything else.</p><p>Now, we just have a fancier label for all those machine smarts. It fits well, so it's good to use it. It works well, so it's good to see it in place. Without it, we might as well use two cans and a string.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company offers an array of genuine Pixel parts for users to purchase and fix their devices (hopefully you don't have to), as well as the tools you'll need to get the job done.

However, consumers may notice a price jump for its display. If you're looking to repair your Pixel 10's screen, it'll run you $159, a $20 jump from the cost to repair the Pixel 9's display. The rear cover also went up in price over last year's by $30 to $89. Fortunately, the Pixel 10's battery is a bit cheaper, as that goes for $42 (a $10 difference).</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Google_Pixel_10_Pro">you get to the Pixel 10 Pro</a>, that device's screen goes for a whopping $249. That's nearly a $40 increase from the Pixel 9 Pro's screen from iFixit last year.</p><p>The rear cover also went up by a few bucks to $99. Google's genuine rear cameras are cheaper this year, running for $199, and its battery is also the same as the base model, going for $42. The publication highlights Google's addition of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14725410">self-repair guides</a> for its latest models, too.</p><h2 id="these-genuine-parts-are-expensive-2">These genuine parts are expensive</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yNCuuqyuMikKZFYxNusmNF" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-Pixelsnap-Charger-with-Stand-official-lifestyle-1" alt="The Pixel 10 Pro on a Pixelsnap Charger with Stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yNCuuqyuMikKZFYxNusmNF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's been working with iFixit for years now, pushing genuine parts to the company for consumers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-lists-pixel-fold-repair-parts">such as the original Pixel Fold</a>. This is a bit of a wild care scenario, considering the Pixel Fold is a foldable, but that device was incredibly expensive for consumers. The most expensive piece, kind of like what we're seeing with the Pixel 10, was its internal display at $899. The price skipped to $909 if you were purchasing the Fold's kit.</p><p>The external was much more manageable (by comparison) at $159.</p><p>Funny thing is, when you compare these Pixel 10 prices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-begins-selling-official-googles-pixel-8-series-parts-and-tools-for-at-home-repairs">to the Pixel 8 series</a>, they're pretty similar. The base Pixel 8's screen went for $160 ($159 Pixel 10), and the Pixel 8 Pro went for $230, which is just $20 less than the Pixel 10 Pro. Consumers have, unfortunately, been exposed to such pricing fluctuations before, and that'll probably continue. The advancements Google continues to implement in its phones, like other OEMs, always change the narrative for the end-user.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The video shows off the fresh design we saw rumored back in September, with a completely flat display and a slightly altered square camera array that slides further onto the back panel, rather than sitting in the corner.</p><p>The clip rolls on to show off a few colors (two green variants and black), but the kicker is its apparent thin device focus. The video turns the phone to its side, showing off how thin it is.</p><p>The tipster backs this up, claiming the phone will measure somewhere under 6mm. It seems like Motorola wants to bring its smartphone line into the recent trends sweeping phone OEMs as of late, like Samsung. The clip shows off its selfie camera, furthering the flat display rumors, as well as a brief look at its on-device AI. There was a banner present in the video that said, "Explore with Perplexity."</p><p>For now, it's unclear when specifically Motorola will reveal this new phone, but the publication reiterates rumors that have said it could take place in October. As usual, these phones are released in China before hitting global markets.</p><h2 id="the-next-edge-2">The next Edge</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The sub-6mm Motorola Edge 70. pic.twitter.com/I3WorcyvTj<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1974099204005113957">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Edge 70 leaks have been light, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-edge-70-leaks-reveal-familiar-design-and-potential-specs">some of the earlier report</a>s this year showed off a design that looked like the 2024 model.

The Galaxy Ring faced reports of battery swelling. Tech content creator Daniel Rotar, also known as ZoneofTech, posted photos showing his Galaxy Ring with a bulging battery and a peeling inner layer, still stuck on his finger (scary, no?).</p><p>In a post on X, he said that while preparing to board a flight, he noticed the ring tightening on his finger and realized that the battery had expanded while he was wearing it. Airport staff stopped him from boarding, and he later needed medical help to remove the ring. After it was removed, Rotar posted photos of the battery pushing against the casing and clearly deformed.</p><p>This has led several people to speculate about the safety of wearables that are worn almost constantly, so close to the skin. Samsung, however, seems to be asking some users to send the ring back so they can investigate additional reports.</p><h2 id="google-launches-it-gemini-powered-nest-products-2">Google launches it Gemini powered Nest products</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AE2qD6ZeGwZaDEFQxXHewj" name="Google-Home-Speaker-lifestyle-berry" alt="Google Home Speaker next to a vase and plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AE2qD6ZeGwZaDEFQxXHewj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Google released its Gemini-powered Google Home lineup after what feels like forever.

The Home Speaker, however, won't be available until Spring 2026.</p><h2 id="oura-ring-4-s-moody-ceramic-collection-and-case-arrive-2">Oura Ring 4's moody Ceramic collection and case arrive</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.64%;"><img id="ZY5gyHhU4CTuG8roUSYqTC" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZY5gyHhU4CTuG8roUSYqTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-unveils-stylish-ceramic-rings-and-its-first-ever-charging-case"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Oura is kicking off October (rather Tech-tober) on the right note, announcing a whole new collection of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Oura Ring 4</a>, along with its first-ever charging case. The latest collection features high-performance ceramic, giving it a look that literally resembles wearing a ceramic ring on your finger, rather than a smart ring.</p><p>The new Oura Ring 4 Ceramic retains the same advanced health tracking capabilities of the original Oura Ring 4. The ring maker appears to be channeling nostalgic mood ring vibes with this collection.</p><p>As for the ring's dimensions, it measures 7.9mm in width, similar to the Oura Ring 4. However, the new collection is significantly thicker, measuring 3.51mm due to the zirconia ceramic material used in the ring.</p><p>Additionally, Oura has launched its first-ever charging case, following four generations of its rings. While it's only compatible with the latest generation smart ring, the case can power up to 5 full charges and complete one ring charge, as well as the case charge, in 90 minutes.</p><h2 id="galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-is-as-good-as-it-gets-2">Galaxy S26 Ultra leak is as good as it gets</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JgxEwPQ7NTjprkdmDmYjpj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-camera-islands-01" alt="Comparing the size and shape of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra versus the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JgxEwPQ7NTjprkdmDmYjpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-leak"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>The launch of Samsung's next flagship is nowhere around the corner; however, we've been seeing leaks drop like hot cakes. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks" target="_blank">OnLeaks</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>) shared CAD-based renders of the Galaxy S26 Ultra in black colorway, showing it off from all angles. While the design shares some similarities with the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, the renders also reveal several notable changes for the upcoming flagship.</p><p>The Galaxy S26 Ultra will reportedly feature a flat-edge frame similar to its predecessor, but the corners are even more rounded this time, aligning with previous leaks that have hinted at this design. The next Ultra could be slightly taller and wider than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, while the thickness will be reduced from 8.2mm to 7.9mm.</p><p>The CAD renders also show a switch with the camera array. The three main lenses sit in a vertical camera island to the left, while the other sensors and flash sit to the right. That said, the phone doesn't look any different than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, at least in these renders.</p><h2 id="pixel-watch-could-get-hypertension-tracking-2">Pixel Watch could get hypertension tracking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fi3WbbQntwazFdFkWueGs6" name="Pixel-Watch-4-all-colors" alt="Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fi3WbbQntwazFdFkWueGs6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-is-apparently-testing-hypertension-screening-on-the-pixel-watch"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>A recent leak suggests that Google could be working on hypertension screening on the Pixel Watch, which was spotted in an APK teardown of the Fitbit app's latest update.</p><p>Reference to "Fitbit Hypertension Study" was seen within the app, which is supposedly designed to gather sensor data from the Pixel Watch and pair it with user-submitted information to test how well the wearable can look for and flag elevated blood pressure levels.</p><p>Participants who enroll in the study will be asked to complete a short questionnaire and allow the watch to passively collect health data; others may need to wear a blood pressure cuff for more direct comparisons.

ADT and Google launched a DIY home security system, which merged ADT-developed smart home hub and sensors with Google's cameras (indoor, outdoor) and doorbells. The hub, of course, remains vigilant for users, guarding their homes, while Google's cameras monitor things from the outside.</p><p>ADT SMART monitoring was another aspect of this collaboration, enabling users to submit video evidence of an event to ADT for examination for verification. There's likely a lot under the hood that we don't realize going into this, and it seems ADT needs to figure out if Gemini will behave well with its central hub.</p><p>That <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut">Gemini for Home</a> announcement occurred this week, with Google announcing its next big steps into an AI-forward smart home. While the company announced new 2K HDR video cameras and doorbells, the Google Home Speaker was another major reveal. This new speaker, rounded, with a colorful ring light, is everything Gemini you want it to be. Users can conversate with the AI naturally, questioning it as they would on their phone and having it control home devices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-labs-wants-you-to-test-the-future-of-ai-starting-with-music">YouTube Labs</a>, users can try out new features before Google makes them more widely available to the general public, and the first is a new AI-powered music DJ/host.</p><p>It's called "Beyond the Beat," and it functions as a radio show featuring two AI hosts who converse with each other before and after songs. After every few songs, the hosts will provide insight into a track that just played or an upcoming song, offering backstories, trivia, history, and more. The offering is not too unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-dj-voice-song-requests-premium-details">Spotify's AI DJ</a>.</p><p>Here's how you can test YouTube Music's new AI hosts and provide feedback on the experience before it rolls out more widely.</p><h2 id="how-to-sign-up-for-youtube-labs-2">How to sign up for YouTube Labs</h2><p>Before you can try the new AI host, you need to be subscribed to YouTube Music or YouTube Premium. If you're already subscribed, you can sign up by using the link: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new" target="_blank"><strong>www.youtube.com/new</strong></a>, or by following the steps below on your smartphone:</p><p>1. Open the YouTube app and tap your <strong>profile icon</strong> in the bottom right corner.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>settings icon</strong> in the top right corner.</p><p>3. Select "<strong>Try experimental new features</strong>."</p><p>4.

Navigate to YouTube Music to begin listening to a radio or auto-generated mix, and the hosts will chime in periodically between tracks.</p><p>You can also pause the hosts if you want to listen to music uninterrupted. You will notice a new button next to the like and dislike options. This button includes a sparkle icon and lets you snooze the AI hosts, providing two options:</p><ul><li><strong>Snooze for 1 hour</strong></li><li><strong>Snooze for a day</strong></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:102.50%;"><img id="796o7bv3Hy7ihmc4tacUWX" name="youtube-music-ai-hosts-snooze" alt="YouTube Music AI hosts snooze button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/796o7bv3Hy7ihmc4tacUWX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2880" height="2952" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Note that you cannot turn off Beyond the Beat.

Google makes note of this in the snooze menu, stating that "AI commentary can make mistakes."</p><p>Fortunately, Google encourages testers to provide feedback, which may help shape the future of the feature if/when it rolls out more widely. In order to do so, navigate back to the YouTube Labs page in the first section. Here, you'll find a Feedback button, which will take you to a form you can fill out regarding your experience.</p><p>Note that not everyone can partake in the experiment. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-youtube-labs/">According to Google</a>, a "limited number of US-based participants can test early prototypes and experiments and influence the future of YouTube."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Just days ahead of the sale, the retailer is offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61" target="_blank"><strong>36% off this Amazon Fire Max 11 "productivity" bundle</strong></a>, which comes with a first-party keyboard and stylus.</p><p>The Fire Max 11 is no doubt the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet#section-best-for-work-and-play">best Fire tablet for work and play</a>, in no small part due to its powerful CPU, large 11-inch display, and these first-party accessories, which are usually sold separately.</p><p>This particular deal is for the Fire Max 11 with 64GB of storage. While that isn't much, the tablet also comes with a microSD slot for those who want to add extra storage. Amazon says it offers up to 14 hours of battery life per charge, while it also includes both front and rear cameras.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$369.97" data-dimension48="$369.97" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="9iie992JWXErVM3sdETXnZ" name="Amazon Fire Max 11 productivity bundle render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9iie992JWXErVM3sdETXnZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="918" height="918" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Fire Max 11 productivity bundle:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$369.97" data-dimension48="$369.97" data-dimension25=""><del>$369.97</del> <strong>$236.49 for Early Prime Day deals</strong></a></p><p>Amazon has cut the price of its Fire Max 11 tablet bundle by over $130, offering buyers a tablet, keyboard, and stylus all for just $236. The Fire Max 11 offers a large tablet screen, an improved processor compared to the rest of the Fire lineup, and up to 14 hours of battery life per charge.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$369.97" data-dimension48="$369.97" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a powerful tablet with a long battery life that you can use for work, hardcore gaming, or other activities that require high-level performance; you want a tablet option that comes with a keyboard and/or stylus; you prefer a larger tablet screen of around 11 inches.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you'd prefer to have access to the Google Play Store without side-loading; you need a tablet that includes a 3.5mm headphone jack; you need a tablet with a selfie cam that's more powerful than 8MP, and you have the budget to upgrade.</p><p>The Amazon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11 </a>is far and away the best out of the Fire tablet lineup, and it still offers a pretty fair price tag. From the 11-inch TUV display and the roughly 14-hour battery life, the tablet is designed to be suitable for a wide range of work tasks, while still being lightweight enough to be used on the go. With this bundle, you get a solid value with the inclusion of a keyboard and stylus, marking $133 in savings.</p><p>It also includes front and rear cameras, both 8MP, as well as dual-speaker audio, a fingerprint scanner, and USB-C audio capabilities. Unfortunately, it doesn't include a 3.5mm headphone jack, but that can be remedied using USB-C or Bluetooth.</p><p>This discount is for the Fire Max 11 bundle with just 64GB of storage, though it also includes a microSD slot for expandable storage of up to 1TB. Performance is backed by the powerful MediaTek MTK8188J processor, and it features split screen and other multitasking features supported by the included 4GB of RAM.</p><p>The bottom line is that, if you were already looking to cash in on a tablet, keyboard, and stylus combo bundle, this might be a good chance to do so.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's cool and all, but the commonality between a phone that costs almost $2,000 and one that's less than $200 is that they can all download the same AI apps.</p><p>Currently, the most prominent players are Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/openais-gpt-5-model-is-the-first-to-give-gemini-2-5-pro-a-run-for-its-money">ChatGPT</a>, Copilot, Claude, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">Perplexity</a>, Grok, and DeepSeek. All of those apps, and many more, are available on either platform, ensuring you'll always have access to your conversations and creations. Yes, there <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/it-still-sucks-that-the-iphone-gets-new-apps-before-android" target="_blank">might be times</a> when the iOS version of ChatGPT gets something first, but the same can certainly be true for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini on Android</a>.</p><p>At the time of this writing, ChatGPT holds the top spot in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps#:~:text=Top%20charts,Top%20paid" target="_blank">Play Store</a>, and the next AI chatbot app doesn't appear until Microsoft Copilot, in tenth place. Surprisingly, the opposite is true on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/ai/charts/iphone/productivity-apps/6007" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>, where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/hey-siri-wheres-apple-intelligence-gemini-is-now-the-top-free-app-on-ios">Google Gemini is the current top free app</a>, followed by ChatGPT in second and DeepSeek in fifth. It just goes to show that Google's marketing is paying off, although there's definitely an argument to be made about the iPhone being a better Google phone than Android.</p><h2 id="apple-s-playing-catch-up-2">Apple's playing catch up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="S4NsoYm7QWdNXLMmer3dyR" name="WWDC 2025 — Apple Intelligence and Apple Devices" alt="Screenshot of WWDC with Apple Intelligence and Apple devices on the screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4NsoYm7QWdNXLMmer3dyR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there's another side to the coin here, and it's one that re-opens the age-old "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/everything-apple-stole-from-android-and-wear-os-at-wwdc-2025">iOS vs. Android</a>" debate. Simply put, Siri is awful and can't hold a candle to Gemini, ChatGPT, or even DeepSeek. Apple is so far behind the 8-ball here that it partnered with OpenAI and Google when introducing "Apple Intelligence" last year.</p><p>Recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-03/apple-plans-ai-search-engine-for-siri-to-rival-openai-google-siri-talks-advance">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg reports</a> that Apple "is planning to launch its own artificial intelligence-powered web search tool next year, stepping up competition with OpenAI and Perplexity AI Inc." Based on the report, this just sounds like it will be an Apple-branded version of Gemini, as Gurman says "The companies reached a formal agreement...to evaluate and test a Google-developed AI model to help power the voice assistant."</p><p>However, Apple isn't stopping there, as this AI-powered search will also be implemented in Siri. But instead of trying to figure out the score of the game or find the name of a brand, it's said that Siri will finally be able to "tap into personal data and on-screen content to better fulfill queries." By pulling resources from other departments and refocusing its efforts, Apple could deliver this enormous overhaul as soon as March 2026 with iOS 26.4.</p><p>Even so, while we all wait for this big AI overhaul, you can still download apps like Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, or Perplexity and perform many AI-related tasks we hope to see from Apple and Siri.</p><h2 id="everyone-else-is-widening-the-gap-2">Everyone else is widening the gap</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D9mryqDg7rcpRyc4xs2WZW" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-gemini-app" alt="The Gemini app on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9mryqDg7rcpRyc4xs2WZW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, Google has just announced new Gemini models, along with a complete overhaul and revamp of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-app-gemini-integration">Google Home app</a>.

Because all of those new features from Google and OpenAI will soon be available on any phone (if they aren't already). So, sure, needing to download an app isn't as seamless as just having it integrated at the OS level. But does it <em>really</em> matter given the abundance of options at our disposal, especially when you can just pick the app that works best for you in any particular instance?</p><p>To answer my own question, no, it doesn't really matter.

Now, a new leak has revealed when the OnePlus 15 will launch in global markets, and if accurate, the release date is not far away.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hindi/oneplus-15-launch-date-in-india-13-november-exclusive-leak/">91Mobiles</a> (in Hindi), the OnePlus 15 will launch globally on November 13, 2025. Citing industry sources, the report claims the phone will launch just weeks after its China debut on October 27, 2025. If true, the OnePlus 15 would arrive in international markets only a couple of weeks after the Chinese release.</p><p>For comparison, this is much faster than what happened with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. That device launched in China on October 31, 2024, but reached global markets nearly two months later, on January 27, 2025.

It seems these summaries will only be "suggested" or invoked whenever there's a longer notification, like something you can just read from the brief preview in your notification panel (think long texts). When receiving a lengthy notification, the publication notes a Samsung alert that states, "your longer conversations can now be summarized to give you quick recaps."</p><p>The alert suggests throwing users into their Settings to activate it. Once it does, it seems Samsung has created a dedicated "Notification Summaries" page.</p><p>The downside to this test is that it's just that: a test. Other than an illustration vaguely showing what this AI summarized feature could look like in the end, the publication was unable to get it to actually function. However, Samsung reiterates that AI summaries can be used for "long messages."</p><p>More than that, it gives the typical disclaimer that the feature utilizes AI on your device, and it "may sometimes make mistakes." Not only is a toggle there for the feature, but it seems Samsung is also thinking of adding a "Manage apps" menu for apps you don't want the AI to consider summarizing.</p><h2 id="the-buzz-about-one-ui-8-5-2">The buzz about One UI 8.5</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="8Df6eBGKwKyGnWxt63qKrk" name="samsung-one-ui-8-5-ai-notification-summaries" alt="Samsung is reportedly testing AI-powered notification summaries for long texts in One UI 8.5." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Df6eBGKwKyGnWxt63qKrk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SamMobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The funny thing about this report is that we've heard about Samsung potentially thinking about AI-based notification summaries <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">since before One UI 7</a>. At the time, the company was thinking about bringing in the feature inspired by Apple's software for iPhones. This feature never made it to the light of day, and we're now seeing it rumored for Samsung's next big update: One UI 8.5 over a year later. While Samsung was thinking about this back in 2024, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-notification-summaries">thinking about it this year</a> for Android 16.</p><p>In March, it was alleged that Android 16 could roll out these summaries for conversations, again, mirroring what Apple has. This feature for Android 16 was spotted during its 3rd Beta, so it remains to be seen if we get it or not.</p><p>One UI 8.5 rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-already-chasing-one-ui-8-5-new-leak-spots-galaxy-s25-test">cropped up recently</a>, as a report claims Samsung has already put its early test builds on its test server using the Galaxy S25 series. Nobody's certain about these features, other than this update should be quite extensive for Galaxy users. Speculation suggests we won't see One UI 8.5 until next year, around the time the Galaxy S26 launches, potentially.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to Mosseri, this test would change how users view Instagram's Home page after opening the app. Instead of being immediately greeted by recommended posts or posts from people you follow, you'd see Reels.</p><p>This change is simply an option that lucky testers in India can toggle if they've been granted random access.</p><p>Mosseri's example shows that users on the homepage would see the usual Stories at the top and, underneath, the Reels would begin. Scrolling down would drop you into the classic Reels feed, which just has you scrolling through the short-form, vertical content. Additionally, the bottom navigation bar would place DMs down there. Mosseri states, "Reels and DMs have driven most all our growth at Instagram over the last few years, so we are exploring making them the first two tabs."</p><p>So, users in the test won't find the DMs icon at the top right. It'll be at the bottom beside the homepage icon.</p><p>What's curious is that Mosseri states this test will still surface photos from users on your homepage, though it's unclear if there's a break in the Reels while scrolling to see regular posts or what.

Reels that were essentially private, only accessible to those with the unique pass, featured secret codes and hints. This was seen as a way for creators to have a "secret club," if you will, for dropping new merch or content for those die-hard fans. Instagram started this test with The Weeknd, giving them early access to some cool things if they cracked the code.</p><p>Of course, beyond music, anyone could create these locked Reels and try to stir up hype, which is exactly what Instagram was going for.</p><p>An update users can get their hands on some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagrams-ai-now-detects-and-protects-teens-even-if-their-profile-says-theyre-adults">new protective measures</a> for teen accounts on the platform. Recently, Instagram started rolling out Teen Account protection in the U.S. and Canada, which leverages AI to detect teen users even if their account's birthday is set to someone of age. If flagged, that user's account will have tighter restrictions regarding who can contact them and the content the app showcases.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Supposedly, Samsung is looking to run its pre-registration period for almost a week, going from October 15 to October 21 (six days in total). Of course, signing up gets you in there to actually pre-order the device a little quicker than others, as SamMobile notes.</p><p>If this report holds true, we can <em>maybe </em>expect an official pre-registration page on Samsung's website to appear in the next two weeks.</p><p>This Galaxy XR headset, also known as "Project Moohan," is once again rumored to debut with a price under Apple's Vision Pro headset. For context, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-vision/apple-vision-pro">Apple lists the Vision Pro</a> with a starting price of $3,500. The South Korean publication also highlighted a statement from Samsung's president of device experience, Roh Tae-Moon, who stated the XR headset has "good comfort" when it comes to its weight and wearability. Additionally, TM Roh said, "voice control can deliver a refined user experience."</p><p>Specifics about the XR headset are still a curiosity for the masses, as the device's sudden Qualcomm appearance yielded nothing but a good look.</p><h2 id="we-re-not-far-now-2">We're not far, now</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:866px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.28%;"><img id="HPngbyiongeXT7q4x6M3jQ" name="samsung-project-moohan-summit-2025-front" alt="A snapshot of Samsung's XR headset, Project Moohan, in a glass display case at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HPngbyiongeXT7q4x6M3jQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="866" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Elec)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 was in September, and Samsung's upcoming Galaxy XR headset <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-summit-2025-surprised-crowds-samsung-xr-headset-showcase">made a not-so-little cameo</a>. The headset was proudly displayed in a glass case, giving visitors at the event a clear look at it from all angles. However, what people were most curious about, specs, features, etc., weren't readily available. It's known that this headset will feature OLEDoS tech. It was also speculated that the headset could sport photo editing, on-device AI (Galaxy AI), and more, thanks to Qualcomm's assistance.</p><p>Project Moohan will seemingly feature quite a bit of Gemini throughout its experience, too.</p><p>That display could be 1.3 inches with a 3552×3840 resolution and roughly 90fps capabilities, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">per recent leaks this year</a>.

It isn't just tech products either; I just bought a washing machine, and LG saw fit to shoehorn AI into that as well.</p><p>While AI is pervasive, it doesn't actually do much. That hasn't prevented phone brands from leaning heavily into AI, positioning it as a dubious differentiator on their latest phones. If you're like me and are ambivalent towards generative AI, here's how to disable it on your phone.</p><p>In this guide, I'm highlighting Google and Samsung phones as they're the two brands that have full-fledged AI suites. Chinese brands are just getting started with AI on their phones, so I'm not focusing on Funtouch OS or ColorOS at the moment, instead talking about Pixel and Galaxy devices.</p><p>Before we get started, you'll need to know that a lot of AI features are baked into the interface, so disabling them isn't quite straightforward. This is doubly so with Pixels, as Google integrates AI-assisted features into most of its utilities, including the Phone dialer, Messages, Google Photos, and Gmail. Similarly, Samsung integrates its own flavor of AI (dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>) into its apps, but if you don't see yourself using any of these, it's easy to disable most features.</p><p>I'm using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> in the steps outlined below, but any recent Pixel or Galaxy phone will have the same flow.</p><h2 id="how-to-disable-ai-features-on-your-google-pixel-2">How to disable AI features on your Google Pixel</h2><p>Let's start with <strong>Gemini</strong>, Google's latest digital assistant. It comes pre-installed on latest Pixels, and cannot be uninstalled as a result. If you don't see yourself using Gemini, you can disable it — that's the closest you can come to uninstalling it. Here's how to do that:</p><ol start="1"><li>Navigate to <strong>Gemini</strong>.</li><li><strong>Long press</strong> the app icon.</li><li>Choose <strong>App info</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Disable</strong>.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5456px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.84%;"><img id="huPmohJSzdVfmfvo8PYNmZ" name="Gemini" alt="Disabling Gemini on a Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/huPmohJSzdVfmfvo8PYNmZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5456" height="2992" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next up is <strong>AI Mode</strong>; Pixels have a Google search bar located at the bottom of the home screen, and with the Pixel 10, the AI Mode button is integrated into the bar.

Garmin Ltd" was filed on September 30 in the U.S. District Court in Colorado.</li><li>Strava filed a 2011 patent for activity segments and a 2013 patent for heatmaps, and now claims that Garmin's Live Segments and heatmaps violate them.</li><li>Strava and Garmin had a 2015 Master Cooperation Agreement to use Strava Live Segments on Garmin watches.</li><li>Strava is demanding a "permanent injunction" on selling any Garmin watches with Strava technology due to "irreparable harm" to Strava's brand.</li></ul><p>Strava has launched a legal battle against Garmin, one of its biggest partners, for "causing ongoing harm to Strava" by using its patented features "in ways that Strava has never authorized or licensed." And it's demanding that a U.S. District judge approve a permanent injunction to stop Garmin from selling watches with its technology.</p><p>The features in question, as detailed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/10/strava-sues-garmin-demands-stop-selling-devices.html">DC Rainmaker's coverage</a> of the lawsuit, are Strava Live Segments, heatmaps, and popularity routing.</p><p>Both Strava and Garmin Live Segments appear on high-end Garmin watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>, as well as its Edge bike computers, so athletes can see their mapped progress and race against other leaderboard times.</p><p>Garmin's Heatmap, meanwhile, is available to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners through the Connect app, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=LsCSM91UbF0avJvjnYuFZA">Trendline Popularity</a> routing is also restricted to its higher-end models. If this lawsuit succeeds, Strava's injunction would require Garmin to remove these features to continue selling its devices.</p><p>Strava clarified to DCR that its lawsuit isn't intended to "disrupt the ability of Garmin users to sync their data with Strava," so that shouldn't be going away. But this lawsuit is still an aggressive move for a brand that relies on fitness watch partners to provide it with data.</p><p>Garmin, meanwhile, has told Android Central that it "won't be commenting on pending litigation."</p><h2 id="the-strava-garmin-fallout-explained-2">The Strava-Garmin fallout, explained</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY" name="strava-live-segments.jpeg" alt="Strava app showing Live Segment records" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Strava segment leaderboards </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Strava first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/9116922">patented</a> its live segments in 2011, after which Garmin launched its own Live Segments in 2014. According to Strava, Garmin and Strava then entered into a Master Cooperation Agreement (MCA) in 2015 to allow Strava Live Segments on Garmin watches, but not for Garmin to "adapt, reverse engineer, use, copy, modify, or distribute" Strava's features for its own Live Segments.</p><p>Now, Strava is claiming that Garmin "leveraged this access to carefully study those features, painstakingly copy them, and then release them as Garmin features," and that Garmin ignored Strava when "informally" asked to stop in June and July 2025.</p><p>Garmin Live Segments have remained visibly available since 2015, without any previous pushback from Strava. The 2025 launches of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/i-put-garmins-connect-trails-breathing-variations-and-rucking-sport-to-the-test">Trails+ routes</a>, however, put Garmin's app in closer competition with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/strava-interview-athlete-intelligence-inaccurate-gps-race-leaderboards-and-more">Strava's Athlete Intelligence AI</a>, and Strava's new leadership may be less inclined to play nice with a direct rival to its monthly subscription service.</p><p>Garmin Live Segments have remained available since 2015, and we're curious if Garmin agrees that the MCA forbade them from continuing to expand the feature, or if it disputes the idea that it copied Strava. But we'll have to wait for Garmin's legal reply to learn more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ep3ZE8r8WgfGWDzqEAhbNf" name="garmin-strava-live-segments-screenshot" alt="An official screenshot of where to find both Strava Live Segments and Garmin Live Segments setup in the Garmin Connect app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ep3ZE8r8WgfGWDzqEAhbNf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin / Strava)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for Strava's heatmaps, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/9297651">patent</a> was originally filed in December 2013 for tracking users' GPS workouts en masse to determine the most popular routes nearby. Night heatmaps are the most recent focus, with an emphasis on safety.</p><p>Strava asserts that Garmin's "Trendline/Popularity routing, heatmaps, Courses, and related features" infringe on its patent. DC Rainmaker claims, however, that Garmin first launched heatmaps back in early 2013, while other fitness brands like RaceShape had them in 2012.</p><p>Garmin may attempt to have Strava's heatmap patent disputed, given that its own service seemingly preceded the patent. But regardless, Strava is challenging Garmin's use of this patented feature after over a decade of letting their two heatmap features coexist.</p><h2 id="what-comes-next-2">What comes next?</h2><p>Strava is gearing up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/fitness-tracking-app-strava-looks-hire-banks-ipo-2025-09-17/">launch its IPO</a> and was valued at $2.2 billion earlier this year. It's interesting timing to see the app open litigation against a popular smartwatch brand prior to going public.</p><p>Strava told DCR that "Garmin has been increasingly aggressive to its partners lately (perhaps due to competitive pressure) and Strava is standing up for the hard work our teams have put into building unique features."</p><p>In truth, both companies have been establishing more strict guidelines with their APIs, telling third-party partners how they're allowed to use their data. Strava's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html">2024 policy </a>prevented other apps from displaying Strava data or using it for AI features.</p><p>Given Garmin's lack of comment, we'll have to wait and see whether it merely defends itself of Strava's claims or attempts to countersue Strava. Until it's resolved, Garmin watch owners and Strava users should be unaffected; in the long run, however, they could lose access to some popular features if this lawsuit is successful.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of relying on external screen protectors or clunky add-ons, Samsung is reportedly building privacy right into the phone’s hardware and software.</p><p>Now, a new leak from One UI 8.5, courtesy of @achultra on X, gives us our first real look at how the feature will work, and it’s a whole system of controls designed to keep sensitive information away from prying eyes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/first-look-at-galaxy-s26-ultra-privacy-display-settings/" target="_blank">SammyGuru</a>).</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The next S26 Ultra will have a privacy feature that keeps people from peeking at your screen. pic.twitter.com/tFcgeFpCqG<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1973610514719842717">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>According to leaked screenshots, users will have the option to adjust how intense the effect is and define specific conditions for when it activates. Samsung seems to be preparing automatic triggers, such as detecting when you’re in a crowded place like a bus, train, or café, and then dialing down the display’s visibility from side angles.</p><p>There’s also a Custom Conditions section buried in the settings, letting you choose your own scenarios, like enabling privacy automatically when you open banking apps or when the lock screen PIN entry appears.</p><h2 id="granular-control-over-screen-areas-2">Granular control over screen areas</h2><p>The controls are surprisingly granular. Leaks show that you’ll be able to select which parts of the display remain fully visible and which get blurred or dimmed. Notifications, picture-in-picture windows, lock screen fields, and private images can all be hidden automatically when Privacy Display is running.</p><p>For users who want maximum protection, Samsung appears to be adding a “Maximum Privacy” mode, which makes the display look even darker and less readable from side angles. Under the hood, the feature seems to rely on something Samsung calls Flex Magic Pixel technology, which tweaks pixel behavior in real time — likely with AI — so that screen content becomes much harder to read unless you’re looking directly at it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:402px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.42%;"><img id="hUuoSLGoq65TfXUxFCWQoK" name="Galaxy-S26-Ultra-privacy-display-feature" alt="Privacy display toggles in Galaxy S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hUuoSLGoq65TfXUxFCWQoK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="402" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @achultra / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:402px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.42%;"><img id="mk65qvspwkZ3tKpFNCoRoK" name="Galaxy-S26-Ultra-privacy-display-feature" alt="Privacy display toggles in Galaxy S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mk65qvspwkZ3tKpFNCoRoK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="402" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @achultra / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What’s interesting is how this ties into One UI 8.5. Code snippets show that Privacy Display will be tightly integrated into the system, with multiple references confirming Samsung is preparing it for launch on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Of course, some questions remain. It’s unclear how much brightness or color accuracy the display will sacrifice when Privacy Display is active, or whether video playback and gaming will look noticeably worse. And since this is still based on leaks, Samsung could refine or even cut certain elements before the feature reaches the public.</p><p>But if these settings are any indication, the Galaxy S26 Ultra could be the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">mainstream phone</a> to ship with a built-in, fully customizable privacy filter that adapts to your surroundings.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Yes, <em>the</em> Gordon Ramsay. Of course, he has no idea who I am or what I'm doing in his kitchen, but Meta lets me see everything via its new Hyperscape app on Meta Quest headsets. Someone at Meta specifically visited Ramsay's house and used a Quest headset to map the space, presenting it in hyper-realistic 3D for the entire world to see.</p><p>Google did something similar with Photosphere back in 2012, but that technology only allowed you to capture a spherical panorama. Meta's new Hyperscape app lets you not only walk around and scan anywhere you want, but also allows you to virtually walk around the area and see everything in full, hyper-realistic detail afterward.</p><p>Walking through a world that quite literally looks <em>real </em>sounds like the future of VR, but Meta is making it happen <strong>today</strong>.</p><h2 id="a-walk-in-the-park-2">A walk in the park</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="Q82H3vKMTUxG8LSLBM6suH" name="meta-quest-hyperscape-bamboo" alt="Exploring a bamboo forest using the Hyperscape app on Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q82H3vKMTUxG8LSLBM6suH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Exploring a bamboo forest in the Hyperscape app (on Meta Quest 3) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I live right by the Biltmore Estate, the largest home in the United States. I most often visit the picturesque grounds for camera reviews, but this time I came toting my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>, instead. I got a few strange looks and questions from guests, but it was all for science.</p><p>Now, whenever I want to show someone how gorgeous the house looks, I don't have to drag them to the grounds. I can show them in VR. Hyperscape makes it easy to scan any location and recreate it in 3D as you walk around and inspect the place.</p><p>It's truly remarkable to see how much can be accomplished with a clever bit of AI and the right hardware. All you need is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">$299 Meta Quest 3S</a> headset and a few minutes to walk around. Suddenly, you're creating impressive virtual spaces that you will soon be able to invite people into. It's a fascinating look at how the metaverse is evolving before our eyes, and it proves that you don't need a powerful gaming PC just to get something that looks this good.</p><h2 id="setup-is-easy-2">Setup is easy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="3b8dv5xyqUw5X7rzJQyagP" name="meta-quest-hyperscape-scan-bamboo" alt="Scanning a bamboo forest using the Hyperscape app on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3b8dv5xyqUw5X7rzJQyagP.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Scanning a bamboo forest </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To try it yourself, download the free Hyperscape Beta app onto your Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S headset, then click "create world" on the main menu. You start by <em>walking </em>around any area you want to map with the headset. Since you can see the world around you through the headset's cameras, this should feel pretty normal.</p><p>As you scan the room, the Quest will overlay a blue grid on top of all the objects, walls, floors, and ceilings. When you're happy with the amount of space you've scanned — I have yet to find a limit — click the <strong>Next </strong>button to head to step two.</p><p>The next step is detail refinement, where you'll walk around once more and provide more mapping information. As you walk around, that blue grid evaporates to let you know the map no longer looks like basic PS1 geometry and is now in full-fledged realism mode.</p><p>The third step is almost optional and involves looking at the ceiling while walking around, which isn't applicable when mapping tall or outdoor spaces.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="fhun9PT2R7ZcvjpGHf6cQV" name="meta-quest-hyperscape-gordon-ramsay-kitchen" alt="Exploring Gordon Ramsay's kitchen using the Hyperscape app on Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fhun9PT2R7ZcvjpGHf6cQV.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Exploring Gordon Ramsay's kitchen in Hyperscape </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And that's it. Now you can take your headset off and carry on with your day while Meta's AI-powered servers put all the data together. You don't need to know how to write code or spend hours learning a complicated new program.</p><p>The Meta Horizon app on your phone will notify you when it's done, allowing you to fully walk around in the space you've just mapped. It feels like magic, and it's going to enable a whole new era of virtual visits to all sorts of places.</p><p>Meta also has several examples of other spaces — like Gordon Ramsay's home kitchen — as well as a collection of the worlds you made. In the future, it's expected that you'll be able to share these spaces with others, inviting friends, family members, or anyone else into each virtual space as a way to remotely converse without having to look down at 6-inch rectangles.</p><h2 id="massive-potential-2">Massive potential</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBNqTRZprxQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>It's hard to express just how impressive this tech really is without seeing it for yourself. While most Meta Quest games are stuck in the PS2 or PS3 graphics eras, Hyperscape sometimes feels like jumping into a PS6 world. Things aren't perfect yet; some textures aren't ultra-high-res, sometimes you'll find ghost geometry in complicated places (like trees), and calculation errors can be seen on text or other places. However, the lighting and even fine detail on complex objects, such as plants, are stunningly impressive.</p><p>I could easily see Meta rolling this out to Horizon Worlds or other spaces once it gets the backend systems ready for sharing. This tech requires a lot of server-side streaming, so it's important for Meta to get the co-location of players right.</p><p>This has massive potential that I can see not just for social spaces, but also for businesses and other functions. I can easily imagine real estate agents using this to virtually showcase homes for people looking to move out of town. Businesses and restaurants could use it to give people an idea of the vibe or look of the space in a way Google Maps doesn't. You could even use it to revisit your first house or favorite place years later.</p><p>Meta dabbles in so many experimental ideas with its Reality Labs department, and Hyperscape is clearly one of the big ideas about to deliver a serious payoff, if my experience with it is any indication.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="801fd96a-1887-44ed-8a37-23a94b875e11">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCUPHg8DY6xth6JoYMuDGK.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Meta Quest 3S with its controllers"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Meta Quest 3S</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Whether you love social environments, puzzle game, multiplayer shooters, or just checking out the next evolution of technology, the Meta Quest 3s has it all at a lower price than you imagined.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

It’s a bid for a cleaner, more content-first experience that tries to streamline how we interact with videos.</p><p>But as with any radical redesign, it’s a gamble. For every user who appreciates the fresh, uncluttered look, there’s another who sees a familiar, efficient tool being rearranged into something unfamiliar.</p><p>The real test won't be in the initial outrage, but in whether we all get used to it or if YouTube decides to listen to the feedback and tweak the formula once again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, one of the headlining features, in addition to Alexa Plus support, is Omnisense,  a feature that allows the latest Echo devices to offer presence detection while also taking advantage of third-party sensors.</p><p>These devices aren’t just reactive—they’re proactive. They greet family members, adjust settings based on who’s home, and even anticipate needs. It’s a major step toward <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-and-qualcomm-finally-realize-what-ai-is-for">ambient computing</a>, where the home responds naturally to its inhabitants</p><h2 id="scaling-smart-home-adoption-with-ai-2">Scaling smart home adoption with AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4QjE7GDAz7Ue44EoUbNrrH" name="Alexa-plus-logo" alt="Amazon Alexa Plus logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QjE7GDAz7Ue44EoUbNrrH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most exciting developments is how AI is helping scale smart home adoption. Amazon revealed that users of Alexa Plus are adopting smart home features at twice the rate of classic Alexa users. That’s a huge leap, and it’s driven by AI’s ability to educate, guide, and assist.</p><p>Imagine asking your assistant, “How do I upgrade my light switch to a smart one?” Alexa Plus can walk you through the process, recommend compatible devices, and even suggest local electricians if you’re not comfortable doing it yourself. This kind of hands-on, conversational support lowers the barrier to entry and makes smart home upgrades feel less intimidating.</p><p>AI also helps users discover features they didn’t know existed. It can suggest automations based on your habits, recommend energy-saving routines, or help troubleshoot issues, all through natural conversation.</p><h2 id="amazon-s-ecosystem-advantage-2">Amazon’s ecosystem advantage</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1305px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aNm6rwnACEjtCPxC5urSce" name="amazon-2025-echo-series-ai-alexa-hero" alt="The 2025 Amazon Echo series launch, featuring the new Dot Max and the latest Show 8 and Show 11." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aNm6rwnACEjtCPxC5urSce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1305" height="734" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon continues to lead in smart home adoption, thanks to its massive install base and third-party support. Alexa Plus builds on this by offering developers access to a new Alexa Plus Store, where services like Lyft, GrubHub, and TaskRabbit can integrate directly into the assistant.</p><p>The TV is a gateway into the smart home, and Amazon’s deep understanding of consumer shopping and media preferences gives it a unique edge. Alexa Plus can offer contextual recommendations, scene-specific search, and even control other devices through the TV interface.</p><p>Smart speakers play a similar role, acting as hubs for entertainment, communication, and automation. With surround sound pairing and ambient sensing, Amazon is turning these devices into central nodes of the connected home.</p><p>And let’s not forget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-amazon-alexa-integration/">Amazon’s partnership with Oura</a>, which hints at a future where biometric data from wearables could drive smart home automations like adjusting lighting based on sleep cycles or triggering routines based on stress levels.</p><h2 id="google-s-strength-search-android-and-wearables-2">Google’s strength: Search, Android, and wearables</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5qct3PjYgik2GUSSLt7qB4" name="Google-booth-at-MWC" alt="Google's booth at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5qct3PjYgik2GUSSLt7qB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google’s strength lies in its software ecosystem. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is deeply integrated into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a>, Google Search, and wearables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch</a>. This gives Google a unique advantage in contextual intelligence and cross-device continuity.</p><p>While wearables aren’t a major part of the smart home today, they’re poised to become essential. Google’s ecosystem is well-positioned to leverage biometric data, location awareness, and user habits to drive smarter automations.</p><p>Google’s partnership with Walmart also positions them to compete with Amazon’s Blink cameras, while gaining retail visibility and expanding their footprint in home security.</p><h2 id="market-outlook-a-mixed-bag-for-growth-2">Market outlook: A mixed bag for growth</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZuXbHA2ktii4vFUyvnXzMC" name="doorbell-3.jpg" alt="Google Nest doorbell" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZuXbHA2ktii4vFUyvnXzMC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, what does all this mean for the smart home market and consumers?</p><p>Despite the excitement, the short-term market outlook remains cautious. Many of the new AI features are coming to existing devices, which means the hardware market may not see a major uplift right away. In fact, global smart speaker and display shipments are forecasted to decline in 2025 and into the first half of 2026.</p><p>Cameras are expected to grow, but only modestly—around 3% in 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P37480">according to IDC</a>. Macroeconomic pressures persist, and the installed base of smart home devices is already large, limiting the need for immediate upgrades.</p><p>However, the new features like AI-generated summaries of what went on around your home based on video analysis are likely to increase usage and engagement. If execution lives up to the promise, this could drive longer-term growth.</p><p>Additionally, both smart speakers and cameras are expected to see a rise in average selling price (ASP), as the most compelling features require newer, more capable hardware. This shift could help manufacturers offset volume declines while offering consumers more value.</p><h2 id="what-about-apple-2">What about Apple?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ" name="apple-intelligence-prompt-imore.jpg" alt="Apple Intelligence prompt on iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple has been relatively quiet on both the AI and smart home fronts.

There are some initial updates for the Scribe that consumers should know, such as Amazon's redesign that's made the device even thinner, coming in now at 5.4mm. The three new Scribes, the Kindle Scribe (with front light), Kindle Scribe (without front light), and the first Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, are even lighter this year and ~40% faster.</p><p>That improved performance is thanks to a quad-core chip, increased memory, and Amazon's Oxide display tech for a snappier feel.</p><p>The Kindle Scribes also feature a "texture-molded" glass display that is designed to replicate the sensation of writing on paper. Moreover, the Scribe <em>with </em>a front light display now features its LED "tightly against the display" to facilitate narrower bezels, which means more screen for your eyeballs.</p><p>While that rounds up the more forward-facing design changes for this year's Scribe, Amazon's Scribe Colorsoft is the first of its kind for the form factor, and follows a year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-colorsoft-signature-edition-launch-details">after the very first color Kindle</a>.</p><h2 id="the-kindle-scribe-gets-colorful-2">The Kindle Scribe gets colorful</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hgyFc2uG3EfHDsL93CsiAU" name="amazon-kindle-scribe-colorsoft-render" alt="Amazon launched its first Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, which soft colors to users looking to highlight text, scribble notes, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgyFc2uG3EfHDsL93CsiAU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first Kindle Scribe Colorsoft packs the same updated designs as the other two Scribes this year. The primary difference is that Amazon has packaged this one with a soft-on-the-eyes colored screen that still brings out that Scribe experience. While the lights are soft for this colored display, Amazon says users should still find vibrant hues, not washed-out tones.</p><p>There's a subtle difference with the Scribe Colorsoft, and that regards its new rendering engine that keeps the writing side of the Kindle fast, smooth, and improves its colors even more. Though everything's not in black and white, the company claims the Scribe Colorsoft can deliver "weeks of battery life."</p><p>Putting aside the hardware side of these devices for a moment, there's a huge set of AI updates for the Scribe that consumers should know. Amazon's been fueling its latest devices with AI, just like it did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv/amazon-new-fire-tv-series-goodbye-to-android-with-vegaos-launch">new Fire TV series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/amazon-ai-powered-echo-series-devices-blend-alexa-plus-omnisence">Echo devices this week</a>. For the Scribe, consumers will notice a revamped Home that brings Quick Notes and the ability to easily open previously opened books, documents, and more.</p><p>Inside Workspace, users can store and organize their imported/created documents, notebooks, books, and other digital items. This is further enhanced if you've connected your OneDrive or Google Drive account, as those files are also easily accessible. The Scribe Colorsoft sits away from the others, bringing a Shader tool, colored pens, and highlights for annotations and notes.</p><p>Amazon also highlights its available AI-powered search involving your documents and files. Users can ask the AI to summarize those files with follow-up questions available afterward.</p><h2 id="coming-soon-2">Coming soon...</h2><p>The Kindle Scribe (front light) starts at $499, the Scribe without its front light starts at $429, and the Scribe Colorsoft begins at $629 in the U.S. Consumers should be aware that these devices are listed on Amazon; however, there's no button to pre-order yet. The post states this devices are coming "later this year," so keep your eyes peeled for more details.</p><p>Next year, Amazon plans to bring these updated models to the U.K. and Germany.</p><p>These Kindle Scribes, when purchased, include a three-month subscription to Kindle Unlimited, bringing in even more AI-powered features, like "Ask this Book" for highlighting passages or sentences and receive answers about its potential story significance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The following apps are now Satellite-ready over T-Mobile:</p><ul><li>T-Life (T-Satellite support)</li><li>AllTrails</li><li>AccuWeather</li><li>CalTopo</li><li>onX</li><li>X (formerly Twitter)</li><li>WhatsApp</li></ul><h2 id="off-grid-and-stress-free-2">Off-grid and stress free</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="ukASEdM24AxQ4KqGDVi4RV" name="t-mobile-t-satellite-ready-apps-android-ios" alt="T-Mobile's T-Satellite service is launching "Satellite-ready" apps, including WhatsApp, X (formerly Twitter), and more for off-grid use when a signal vanishes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukASEdM24AxQ4KqGDVi4RV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to X, T-Mobile states its satellite connectivity network will keep you involved with the social media platform if you lose your cellular connection. Users can view posts, videos, GIFs, and more through T-Satellite. Additionally, users can "control when high-res media loads" to avoid overusing their data. For WhatsApp, T-Satellite customers can now start voice and video calls anywhere without a cell connection. Texting, sending pictures, and the like are possible, too.</p><p>Access to these apps for T-Satellite customers is rolling out for Android and iOS users today (Oct 1).</p><p>Consumers on T-Mobile business plans will find T-Satellite support for apps like DialPad, FLORIAN, MultiLine, and T-Mobile Direct Connect.</p><p>The press release to Android Central earlier today states, "T-Satellite is included on T-Mobile’s best plans and available to all other wireless users — even Verizon and AT&T customers — for $10/month."</p><p>T-Mobile's "Satellite-ready" apps are essentially getting an expansion with this update. When the satellite service first launched, the company supported off-grid use for apps like Google Messages, Find Hub, Pixel Weather, Apple Music, Weather, Fitness, Samsung's Weather app, and more. You could probably see those apps as more like the "core" of the matter, and what's rolling out now is an expansion of that sentiment.</p><p>T-Mobile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile/t-mobile-adds-mms-texting-t-satellite-network-test-reported">launched its T-Satellite service</a> on July 23 after an extensive testing period in which roughly 1.8 million users joined to help polish. Also in July, T-Mobile started roping in Samsung and Motorola users into its off-grid services with MMS texting support. Users without a signal could still send images, GIFS, and audio clips for certain devices at the time. There's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">more that's worth knowing</a>, but it's all relatively straightforward when you get down to it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone has a new design with a wider camera plateau that immediately grabs attention, and Apple switched to aluminum after dabbling in titanium for the last two years.</p><p>But what I like the most this year is that the iPhone 17 Pro is available in orange. That's the model I'm using, and it's delightful to use an iPhone in a vibrant color. Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed the Natural Titanium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> quite a bit, but the orange hue this year is eye-catching on an entirely different scale.</p><p>There are plenty of other upgrades; the iPhone 17 Pro gets the all-new A19 Pro silicon, and there's a new vapor cooling system that unlocks much better sustained performance. There's a bigger battery this generation as well, and better ingress protection.</p><p>The cameras are also overhauled, with the iPhone 17 Pro now touting a trio of 48MP modules along with a new 18MP selfie lens that switches orientation automatically — which is very cool. Basically, if you're using an older iPhone, there are enough new features and upgrades on the iPhone 17 Pro to make it an enticing choice if you need the additional cameras.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-17-pro-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Apple iPhone 17 Pro: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vGSkMJPHEVFCUXEYrPUoCi" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vGSkMJPHEVFCUXEYrPUoCi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple unveiled the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, iPhone Air, and 17 Pro Max on September 09, with all models going on sale starting September 19.

The wide camera bar (err, plateau) distinguishes the iPhone 17 Pro from its predecessors, and the design is uncharacteristically bold. While the new design won't be to everyone's tastes, I love the styling, and the aluminum unibody gives the iPhone 17 Pro a much better presence than previous years.</p><p>The rectangular camera plateau isn't just for show; it houses a bulk of the internal components, which is an achievement in and of itself. In doing so, the iPhone 17 Pro gets a sizeable battery boost, and the difference is immediately noticeable. While I used Pro models in the past, I prefer using the Pro Max because of the bigger panel and all-day battery, but even on the Pro variant, I managed to get a day's worth of use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="8WWZmZwfyXMHSwSSNVJ2Ui" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8WWZmZwfyXMHSwSSNVJ2Ui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5092" height="2868" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm using the Indian variant of the iPhone 17 Pro, which has a nano-SIM slot.

Sure, it's not consistent and it affects usability at times, but it is a definite step up over the earlier UI, which was starting to look bland.</p><p>Apple's custom apps have all switched to the new interface, and the design feels cohesive. There are a few errant crashes that I haven't noticed in previous years, and inevitably, the interface has bugs, but the iOS 26.1 addresses this to an extent. There's much better customization, and I like that quite a bit — it was an area where iOS lagged behind Android in previous years.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xT8aTTunkD6DnrPiLsmhti" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xT8aTTunkD6DnrPiLsmhti.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pZFL7kWqCVvwgKza4rmYBj" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pZFL7kWqCVvwgKza4rmYBj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>On the whole, iOS 26 feels modern but familiar at the same time.

If you don't need great auxiliary cameras, it is the model to get. The regular iPhone 17 finally comes with ProMotion tech, bringing the panel to 120Hz, and it has a new 48MP camera, allowing it to take better images and videos.</p><p>Then there's the iPhone Air. The ultra-thin device is in an entirely different league, and I didn't think I'd enjoy using it as much as I have. It doesn't have the best cameras, and the battery isn't anywhere as good as the iPhone 17 Pro, but it is cool in a way that no other phone can manage in 2025.</p><p>If you're looking at an Android alternative, I'd recommend the Pixel 10 Pro. Google's latest phone is iPhone-esque to such an extent that there isn't much of a difference between the two. You get much better AI features on the Pixel 10 Pro, and the cameras are better — particularly the tele lens.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-17-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Apple iPhone 17 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5068" height="2855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You're using an older iPhone</li><li>You want an iPhone with bold styling</li><li>You need the best cameras on an iPhone</li><li>You want an iPhone that's easy to hold and use</li><li>You need reliable battery life</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need a bigger panel</li><li>You want the best telephoto lens</li></ul><p>There really isn't much of a reason to upgrade phones year-on-year — we're well past that cycle. That said, the iPhone 17 Pro brings welcome changes at a time when the models were starting to get a little stale. The bold styling in and if itself is a big enough change that it will prove to be divisive, but I like what Apple did in this area.</p><p>Other than that, you get the usual upgrades: the iPhone 17 Pro is faster, lasts longer, takes better photos and videos, and feels better to hold in hand. It makes a strong case for itself if you're looking to upgrade to a new phone this year, while still feeling familiar enough that it isn't jarring.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision to buy the iPhone 17 Pro is down to your requirements; if you need the auxiliary cameras and like the new design, it is the way to go. But if you just need the basics, the iPhone 17 is a good choice this year, and the iPhone Air is outstanding in its own right. Essentially, you've got much more choice than previous years, and that's always a good thing.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ca498710-3b62-4109-955c-1092fa4d58cc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egnTiinBmNpHDkPPfnMf5C.jpg' alt="The iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Apple iPhone 17 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The iPhone 17 Pro comes with a ton of useful upgrades, from the bold new design to standout cameras, and a bigger battery.

The company announced that Daniel Ek, Spotify’s founder and CEO, will step aside from the CEO role and become Executive Chairman starting January 1, 2026.</p><p>In his new capacity, Ek plans to remain deeply involved as an active strategist overseeing long-term direction, capital allocation, regulatory issues, and key decisions.</p><p>Why now? According to Ek, it’s because the two executives already running much of the day-to-day are ready to take formal control.</p><p>Spotify is handing over the CEO reins to Gustav Söderström (formerly chief product and technology officer) and Alex Norström (formerly chief business officer). They will become co-CEOs, reporting to Ek and (pending shareholder approval) joining Spotify’s board of directors.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">streaming platform</a> says this is not a major change. It is simply making official what has already been happening since about 2023, when Söderström and Norström started leading strategy and operations.</p><p>In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-09-30/spotify-announcement-daniel-ek-executive-chairman/" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Spotify calls the new setup a 'European chairman' model, meaning Ek will stay involved, unlike the more distant role of a typical U.S. board chair.</p><p>In a joint statement, the incoming co-CEOs emphasized their long cooperation at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">Spotify</a> and their commitment to maintaining momentum.</p><h2 id="controversy-in-the-mix-2">Controversy in the mix</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nS4bjbyKmiSYtyq4VFAYJF" name="Spotify-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Spotify Premium on an Android phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nS4bjbyKmiSYtyq4VFAYJF.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A layer of controversy shadows the timing.

It operates across 184 markets, supports over 700 million users, and claims leadership in streaming.</p><p>Ek stressed that Spotify’s first full year of profitability has arrived, and that the business is stable and capable of this transition.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This component is designed specifically for the math and data handling required by artificial intelligence and machine learning models, making it significantly different from standard phone hardware, such as the CPU and standard GPU.</p><p>It works with the "normal" phone hardware to transform lines of code into something that appears to think or be intelligent.

Without one, AI processing on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> (or any device, for that matter) will be significantly slower, consume more battery, and likely require an internet connection and a remote AI server to function. Chip makers have their own brand of NPU: Google has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor Core</a>, Apple has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">Neural Engine</a>, Qualcomm has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Hexagon NPU</a>, and so on. They all do the same things slightly differently.</p><p>However, you also need standard phone hardware to bring everything together and enable faster and more efficient AI processing.</p><p>The CPU manages and coordinates the entire system. For AI, it handles the initial setup of the data pipeline, and for some smaller, simpler models, it may execute the AI task itself, albeit less efficiently than the NPU.</p><p>The GPU can accelerate some AI tasks, especially those related to image and video processing, as its parallel architecture is well-suited for repetitive, simple calculations. In a <strong>heterogeneous architecture</strong> (utilizing multiple processor components on a single chip), the system can select the most suitable component (NPU, GPU, or CPU) for a specific AI workload.</p><p>AI models, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gcd-2024-google-ai-tested-llm-chatbots-with-werewolf">large language models</a> (LLMs) used for generative AI, require a large amount of fast RAM (Random Access Memory) to store the entire model and the data it's actively processing.
