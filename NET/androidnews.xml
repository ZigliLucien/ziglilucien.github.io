Basically, you could get gimbal-like smoothness without actually needing a gimbal.</p><p>The current Pixel phones already handle stabilization pretty well, but the latest leak says the Pixel 10 is about to take it to the next level.

Bit by bit, the puzzle is coming together on what Google’s next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> will bring.</p><p>When it comes to cameras, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL are expected to stick pretty close to what we’ve seen before.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>My wife summed up the OnePlus 13s perfectly: "this just looks like a smaller iPhone, but with Android." That's basically what it is to use the OnePlus 13s; while it is good to see OnePlus making a compact device — the OnePlus X came out a decade ago — the 13s ends up deviating a bit too much from the manufacturer's design language.</p><p>Look, I get that most phones these days have a similar design, and I'm okay with that; switching to a flatter profile allows brands to slot in massive batteries, and that's undoubtedly a good thing. But with the 13s, it feels like OnePlus intentionally tried to make a device that's as close to the iPhone as possible, and it isn't just the hardware design — the changes to OxygenOS bring it closer to iOS.</p><p>I had the OnePlus 13s for over a month, and I used the device extensively in that time. This is what you need to know about OnePlus' compact flagship, and whether you should pick it up.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-specs-price-and-global-availability"><span>OnePlus 13s: Specs, price, and global availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LeWaEqBKVwUhoGaSAn5T93" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeWaEqBKVwUhoGaSAn5T93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus unveiled the 13s in India on June 5, and the phone is going on sale in the country in the coming weeks. The device is identical to the OnePlus 13T that debuted in China back in April, with two differences: the 13s has a smaller 5,850mAh battery (the 13T has 6,260mAh), and the 13s gets a 32MP selfie camera with autofocus.</p><p>The 13s is available in two configurations: the base model with 12GB/256GB storage is going on sale in India starting at ₹54,999 ($640), and there's also a 12GB/512GB model that costs ₹59,999 ($699). The device basically slots in between the OnePlus 13R and OnePlus 13, and it isn't quite as affordable as I thought it would be.</p><p>Why the name change to 13s, you ask? OnePlus says it did so to highlight the fact that this is a smaller phone. As to why it didn't do so in China, your guess is as good as mine. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is available globally, OnePlus isn't selling the 13s outside India, and the 13T is exclusive to China.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 13s</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.32 -inch 120Hz LTPO AMOLED, 2640x1216, 1600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, Adreno 830, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Sony Lytia LYT-700, PDAF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Samsung JN5 tele, 2x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP GalaxyCore GC32, autofocus, 4K video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP65 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, limited 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, AptX HD, LDAC, LHDC 5.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,850mAh battery, 80W charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>150.8 x 71.7 x 8.2mm, 185g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Green, Pink, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-design"><span>OnePlus 13s: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="oyLyqYW39pBzTkzpvZpRz" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyLyqYW39pBzTkzpvZpRz.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5050" height="2845" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus says the 13s has a "stunning new design," but what it actually looks like is an iPhone.

With a height of 150.8mm (the OnePlus 13 is 162.9mm) and weighing just 185g, the 13s is a good choice if you need a compact device. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> is shorter and lighter, but you don't get anywhere as large a battery, and the device isn't quite as good to use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CjY9FQpcfMdVnpkrTBLgW" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CjY9FQpcfMdVnpkrTBLgW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another positive is that the camera island doesn't protrude too much from the chassis, so there isn't much in the way of wobble when using the phone on a table. The rounded square design looks good, and it highlights the dual cameras at the back.

The design of the Plus Key and the associated software sub-menu is as close to a facsimile of the iPhone's Action Button as I've seen on any device.

OnePlus made several changes to the software this year, and the design brings it closer to iOS. A new addition is AI Plus Mind, a feature that collates photos, notes, and other data in a single location. If you have any information you'd like to save — bills, event QR codes, and so on — just press and hold the Plus Key, and it gets saved to Mind Space.</p><p>The utility uses machine learning to extract relevant information. If that sounds familiar, it's because Nothing's Essential Space basically does the same thing, and if anything, Google's Pixel Screenshots has a similar utility. I'll admit that it is useful in certain scenarios, but as of now, it doesn't do much other than summarizing information.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Bq8UuJomJEBE2pqYV9y5G3" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bq8UuJomJEBE2pqYV9y5G3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can't take your data out either, so it is tied to the device. As it stands, there isn't much to justify the feature, but it's clear that the manufacturer sees AI as a point of differentiation (like every other phone brand), so it should get better features in the coming months.</p><p>Most of the time, using the software on the 13s was an exercise in frustration. I migrated data from the Vivo X200 Pro, but it didn't install everything — basic apps like Amazon and Swiggy didn't show up, and I had to go to the Play Store and download these again. This is never an issue on other devices, but I ran into the same problem on the OnePlus 13 earlier this year, so I'm highlighting it.</p><p>Background memory management continues to be very aggressive, so if you have an app in the background, it will be shut down after a few hours. There is intermittent lag when browsing in Chrome, and it could just be a case of the device not being optimized ahead of launch, as I didn't see this issue on the regular model.</p><p>And then there's the usual AI-backed features. You get AI Search and AI transcribing along with translation, and they do a decent enough job. There's a new AI Call Assistant, and it is meant to provide real-time translation. I tested it with Hindi to English, and it just didn't do a good enough job translating the call on the fly; the resultant text was wrong in many areas, and it wasn't able to handle entire sentences.</p><p>Coming to updates, the 13s will get the standard four years of Android updates alongside six years of security patches.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-the-alternatives"><span>OnePlus 13s: The alternatives</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma" name="iqoo-13-16.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like the OnePlus 13R, and although it isn't as fast as the 13s, you won't notice any difference in daily use, and it has a bigger AMOLED panel and larger battery.

It is better-suited as a gaming device.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-should-you-buy-it"><span>OnePlus 13s: Should you buy it?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="9ocwAHJ4TseUCYgADBRxv" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ocwAHJ4TseUCYgADBRxv.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5134" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need a powerful compact phone</li><li>You want reliable battery life</li><li>You want a good camera at the back</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You want bug-free software</li><li>You're used to the alert slider</li><li>You need meaningful AI features</li></ul><p>On the whole, the OnePlus 13s doesn't do enough to merit a recommendation; the compact design and high-end hardware is a clear differentiator, and there's a distinct dearth of such devices today.

OxygenOS 15 is now veering so close to iOS that it just doesn't have any originality left, and there are enough annoyances with bugs that it wasn't enjoyable to use the phone. I'm sure these will be resolved a few weeks after the phone goes on sale — that's always been the case in the last three years — but I don't see why these couldn't be addressed beforehand, like every other phone manufacturer is able to do.</p><p>Most of the time, I felt like I was beta testing the 13s. The OnePlus 13 continues to be an outlier in that it didn't have any of these issues out of the box, and with the 13s, OnePlus is back to its usual shenanigans of launching a phone before it's ready. If you're willing to wait a few weeks (or even months), then the 13s has the potential to be a decent enough choice in this category. But as it stands, it just doesn't measure up.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and many other web browsers are based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/no-chromium-browsers-arent-going-anywhere-any-time-soon">Chromium code</a>; however, Google doesn't control these programs or their branding.</p><p>Yes, Chrome is a brand, and Google does a lot to make sure it's a recognizable one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wNiJg57PLFagd7kuHJFHoa" name="chrome-generative-ai-gemini-update.jpg" alt="Chrome gets a new generative AI update with Google Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wNiJg57PLFagd7kuHJFHoa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You also need to differentiate Chrome a little bit.

It's further split out into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chrome-os-flex">Chrome OS Flex</a>, a version for devices that are a little older and no longer supported through the same channels, and unstable testing versions designed for developers.</p><p><strong>The </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-for-android-is-getting-extensions-but-not-like-youd-expect"><strong>Chrome Browser</strong></a><strong> for mobile</strong> is a version of Chrome that will run on your smartphone. It's built for both Android and iOS from mostly the same code and is an officially licensed Google product. It's further split into a Stable, Extended Stable, Beta, Developer, and Canary version for different levels of feature testing. <strong>Right up front</strong>: if you find an article like this helpful, forget all about the Dev and Canary versions. They're usually pretty broken and <em>really</em> only for people who love to test stuff.</p><p><strong>The </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chrome-96-stable-rolling-out"><strong>Chrome Browser</strong></a><strong> for desktops</strong> is the last version you'll encounter.

The more products with a Chrome label and a good bit of interoperability because of the shared code, the stronger the recognition and development community will be.</p><p>You probably don't need to worry about browser rendering tests or any sort of web development, so that cuts things down a bit. You also won't need to understand the Extended Stable branch unless you're a corporate developer, so you can safely forget about it, too.</p><p>That makes things a lot easier.</p><h2 id="which-should-you-choose-2">Which should you choose?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yGkWXEEK3QACexpixsxsa8" name="Chrome-Logo" alt="The Chrome logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGkWXEEK3QACexpixsxsa8.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first thing to consider is whether you should use Chrome at all. Most people do, and if you have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, it's there whether you like it or not, but there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">other web browsers</a> for you to choose from. Some aren't as good, some are a little better, and they all offer a distinct feature or two. Spend some time checking a few out if you're curious, and you might like one enough to keep it around.</p><p>Second, if you're talking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>, you don't really have a choice. A Chromebook (or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebox" target="_blank">Chromebox</a>) comes from the manufacturer with the correct version of Chrome OS installed, and until it's no longer supported, you can only choose to run the stable version or a non-stable testing version. Avoid selecting one of those for a Chromebook you use daily. Keep things that are designed to be simple, well, simple.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb" name="mobile browsers-2.jpg" alt="Mobile web browser apps on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1384" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On your phone, things can get a little weird. I'm going to tell you that if you're reading an article like this one and want to know a bit more about all this, stick with the stable version that is already installed on your Android phone. If you have an iPhone, just use Safari unless you have a specific reason not to. Again — keep it simple.</p><p>You'll see other articles or social media posts about all the cool things you could do with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-your-software-channel-chrome-os">unstable version of the Chrome Browser</a>. While tempting, remember that any of those that actually work as intended will make it into the stable branch of Chrome you're using.</p><p>These unstable versions are there to test changes at different levels of completeness — Canary is going to be brand new and busted, Dev might work enough to start testing how your development projects work with it, and Beta is there once someone at Google decides new code works well enough for a more general test with a few million users.</p><h2 id="don-t-rock-the-boat-unless-you-want-to-2">Don't rock the boat. Unless you want to.</h2><p>Really, this is a good way to test things. If I were a backend web developer, for my job, I wouldn't care how my software works with Chrome Canary or Chrome OS Canary. I would want to check out the latest Dev version to see if I'll need to make any changes, and for everyday use, I would run the Beta channel.</p><p>I'm not a web developer; I'm a guy who bangs on a keyboard for a living. I stick with stable Chrome all around. I don't want broken features causing me problems, and since I need to use Chrome for work, I stick to the latest release version. For goofing around, I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-mozilla-firefox-update-so-important-even-department-homeland-security-says-you-should-upgrade">Firefox</a> on both my phone and my desktop computer for everything but online shopping. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-dont-know-what-id-do-without-chromes-autofill-feature">Google's tools to securely store payment options</a> are pretty great.</p><p>Only you know what your tolerance for broken stuff will be. The way to stay away from it (mostly, all software is buggy sometimes) is to forget all about it and stick with the stable version.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Something substantial was supposedly discovered in the Google Translate app's latest version, which concerns its results page. The tipster's evidence shows Google is preparing a "list of possible translations," as well as the most plausible/closest one.</p><p>The latter is featured at the top in larger text, accompanied by the definition and uses of the word.</p><p>However, beneath that, outlined in a thin border, is Google's planned "More translations" box. It's there that users could see other ways a word in English or another language could be translated for whatever you've chosen. Google will state whether these translations are adjectives or otherwise, alongside how they can be used in a sentence.</p><p>The tipster also discovered the ability to "expand" on these other translations. Selecting one of these alternate translations places it front and center (or front and higher?) on the UI, right below the word you wanted translated. The post states that two new options were found: "Regional Variants" and "Ask a question."</p><h2 id="google-s-fresh-future-2">Google's fresh future</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="5rgfDsAkSbA7xcu8AJfU3d" name="google-translate-revamped-more-translations-look" alt="A snapshot of Google Translate's potential redesign, which places your initial word large at the top with the translation under that and "more translations" further down." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rgfDsAkSbA7xcu8AJfU3d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="zXamq3irbi4byjwKxGGw3d" name="google-translate-revamped-insights-button-leak" alt="Google Translate's code suggests it could have an "Insights" button on the way, which shows how to use the word in that other language." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zXamq3irbi4byjwKxGGw3d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The former gives some lengthy text about the word's usage in the country and its "core meaning," if available.

According to the post, speculation says the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will see a 256GB and a 512GB storage option. The leak touches on the possibility of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a>, as well, stating a slightly smaller selection: 128GB and 256GB.</p><p>Colors are the other side of these leaks, but the publication only highlights the expected flagship Flip 7. Its information suggests the device will debut in a Coral Red, black, and blue option.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is supposedly launching with a blue option called "Blue Shadow." This is rumored to be joined by a black and silver color choice.</p><h2 id="the-next-watch-2">The Next Watch</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tJcLE9Td92zZ82wCWF3q45" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-01.jpg" alt="One of the new watch faces on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tJcLE9Td92zZ82wCWF3q45.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication's sources also provided some alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic details, which claim it will arrive in a black and white option. The wearable leaks differ here, as the post states the regular Galaxy Watch 8 could see a 40mm and a 44mm size for interested consumers. Strangely, the rumors only mention one color option, Graphite (likely a silver tone), for these two size variants.</p><p>Leaks about Samsung's foldables and upcoming watches have cropped up more consistently recently, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-suggests-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-galaxy-z-flip-7-wont-see-a-price-hike">speculation about the former's pricing</a>. Supposedly, Samsung's next foldables might not increase prices in "most regions," and remain at $1,099 for the Flip 7 and $1,899 for the Fold 7. However, as the threat of more substantial tariffs intensifies in the U.S., there's a chance consumers could see a ~30% or 40% price hike.</p><p>In other news, the Galaxy Watch 8 series caught a few eyes as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-series-imagery-squircle-quick-button-leaks">some alleged imagery</a> suggests it could rock a squricle (square, circle fusion) design. If true, this would bring the next series closer to Samsung's previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra. </a>The Watch 8 Classic is also rumored to have a third physical button on the way, dubbed the "Quick" button. Again, this is another instance in which the Classic could become more Ultra.</p><p>We don't have much longer to wait until we see what's really what. We're expecting Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">summer Galaxy Unpacked</a> to kick off this summer, potentially in July.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

I'm going to be upfront — I do not trust Perplexity as a company. I'm not claiming there's anything malicious going on, but the company's track record simply gives me no reason to trust them.</p><p>I really don't trust Google, Samsung, Apple, or anyone else either, not when it comes to the ability to do anything with my phone. Once something is deeply integrated into the OS, such as an AI agent from the factory, all bets are off.

Phone makers use AI to do everything nowadays. AI tries to optimize your network connections, creates a photo when you press the camera button, and it's part of what tells your phone to stop charging before it blows up. I am not referring to this type of AI, although there may be a more effective, albeit more expensive, way to handle these tasks.</p><p>I'm talking about AI like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Google Gemini</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bixby">Bixby</a>, or now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">Perplexity</a>. AI gets in your face if you let it, but it is always there to do things someone else decided you wanted it to do. When software like that gets a set of elevated permissions (meaning it can do <em>more</em> with the system and data than even you can), it needs to be because we asked for it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="p2mDbY2B8NDmcTp5RaTK8k" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-alleged-renders" alt="Camera design update on Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p2mDbY2B8NDmcTp5RaTK8k.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Render of what the Galaxy Z Flip 7 may look like. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wasn't planning on buying a new Galaxy phone this year, but it's one I will often recommend. I think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung makes good products</a>. If I were thinking of buying one, seeing a third party in the mix in ways that could be too invasive, I'd probably decline. I'm not pointing my finger at Samsung alone — I'm also wary of buying a new Razr or a Pixel due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">invasive AI that has been built into the system</a>.</p><p>I imagine there's a way to remove it if you're willing to do the work. Android isn't open like it used to be, but smart people have figured out how to keep doing smart things. I'm not going to worry about removing it. Instead, I'll just not buy into it, at least until I can have a little more faith in it.</p><p>The best option would be to let me buy a phone without all of it there in the first place. I should be the one to decide who has any control over my digital life, no matter how insignificant it may be. This won't happen, and eventually, I will relent or I'll be left behind; this is the future, whether anyone likes it or not.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Speaking about how the Korean OEM designed this 5.8mm thin device, Gaiser said that "We really designed this from the ground up to be thin. The goal was to be thin without compromise." The company didn't want to take away features while chasing to create a slim phone, he added.</p><p>Samsung had to make a device that was durable, despite being extremely thin, by utilizing a titanium frame and Corning's Ceramic 2. "So that way, we're able to utilize every single component as efficiently and effectively as possible and making sure that how we put it together gives you a really good balance in the hand," Gaiser says.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-10" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Gaiser said they didn't want to compromise on anything while creating this phone, in reality, they did give the phone a smaller battery capacity when compared to the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series </a>lineup.</p><p>Battery capacity is a top priority for anyone buying a new phone, and Gaiser says, despite the 3,900 mAh capacity, the phone doesn't drain out by lunch, and it lasts people an entire day. "It has worked as well or better than the S24 base model and very close to the S25 base model," he added.</p><p>Speaking about the device's camera, since it lacks a telephoto lens with a 3x zoom, Gaiser says that the phone makes up for it with the latest camera tech as well as agentic AI.

Rolling out today (June 4), Glance states Galaxy users will soon be able to "visualize themselves" in different styles and places.</p><p>Samsung's head and senior director of Galaxy Store in the U.S., Jason Shim, says, "By using AI to personalize content and shopping directly on the lock screen, it brings a smarter, more dynamic experience that reflects the forward-thinking spirit of the Galaxy Store."</p><p>Glance adds that this new experience is tailor-made for Galaxy users; however, it still leverages Google's Gemini and Imagen models. This "opt-in" experience will train its shopping capabilities using the selfies (or images) you provide. Glance says its software will create "hyper-real images of consumers" in outfits it believes you'd look the best in. When used from your Galaxy S25 Ultra's lock screen, Glance states users can easily access its app's features while also saving the look as a new wallpaper or shareable photo.</p><p>The outfits Glance AI pulls from include over 400 of its partnered brands and retailers across the U.S. and abroad. Purchasing the outfits you see remains easy, as well, with just a tap whenever something piques your interest.</p><p>Glance and Samsung's partnership will bring this new shopping app and lock screen experience to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">the Galaxy S25 series</a> (excluding the Edge), the S22 series, the S23 series, and the S24 series (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">the S24 FE</a>, too).</p><h2 id="2"></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:200.00%;"><img id="HTprMKVMfLWuEV6fao3hbk" name="Glance-AI-app-01" alt="Glance AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HTprMKVMfLWuEV6fao3hbk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="300" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Glance)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In case you're wondering, Glance says its AI software is conscious of ongoing trends, "local events," social media content, and more. Additionally, Glance's shopping AI and lock screen experience will also inform users of sales, just in case you really want that outfit.</p><p>As previously stated, the Glance AI shopping app and lock screen experience are rolling out for those Galaxy devices today (June 4), available in the Galaxy Store.</p><p>In May, Glance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/glance-ai-allows-to-shop-fashion-via-personalized-ai-generated-lock-screen-visuals">revealed its new generative AI-backed</a> shopping experience for phones and their lock screens. One of the differences Glances says it upholds is that it puts the user front and center with a curated set of outfits and styles. This all leverages the selfie you provide, as well as additional information, such as your age, body type, gender, and hit generate.</p><p>Glance's partnered brands include Levi’s, Old Navy, and Tommy Hilfiger.</p><p>It's also worth noting that this Google-supported company is interested in pursuing more AI styling assistance for beauty, accessories, and travel. This is all part of its plans for "later this year," so keep your eyes open.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This digital technology offers a ton of convenience and versatility when switching phones, making eSIM-compatible devices perfect for regular travelers. </p><p>Rather than putting your entire user identity into a tiny physical chip, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/difference-between-sim-and-esim-and-what-future-holds">eSIMs</a> (or Embedded Subscriber Identity Modules) digitally preserve all of this information so you don't need to worry about it. This means that you can swap your eSIM to different phones or easily change <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">wireless carriers</a> when you're travelling internationally, plus there's an inherent security benefit when you don't have a physical card that could be tampered with or stolen. Some Android phones even let you have multiple eSIM cards active at the same time. </p><p>Of course, not every Android phone is eSIM-compatible, and the ones that are can cost a pretty penny. But fear not — I've gathered all of the best eSIM-compatible phones below, with options for every need and budget under the sun. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-at-a-glance"><span>At a glance</span></h3>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="6bcb2b5f-0c2e-4331-a6cf-dd3fb6801ba9">            <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-esim-compatible-android-phones#section-best-overall" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy S25"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAJ2amipBfc3ahcYNfPVtb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 in Navy"><span class='featured__label hero__label'>Best overall</span></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">1.

And thanks to its compact 6.2-inch frame, it's also one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small phones</a> on the market today, making it a perfect pick for travelers and homebodies alike. </p><p>The phone is much lighter, slimmer, and easier to hold than the Galaxy S24, while the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 construction ensures you can count on the phone's durability no matter where you are in the world. The flagship phone is also driven by the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePlus 13, plus you get stellar AI-boosted software features, 12GB of RAM, and seven years of OS/security upgrades straight out of the box. The Galaxy S25 also boasts eSIM and dual-SIM support in both the United States and internationally, making it a versatile device for traveling overseas. </p><p>Again, the Galaxy S25 is unfortunately not a major upgrade over its predecessor, especially when you're looking at the cameras and battery life. That's not to say that these specs are <em>bad</em>, but they feel a bit underwhelming when you consider today's competitive Android landscape. Still, if you want a compact smartphone with eSIM support, the Galaxy S25 is going to be the best choice for most folks.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="N8wpvHELb2TPLrXCayXfE9" name="Google-Pixel-9a-on-ground" alt="The porcelain Google Pixel 9a sitting on top of bark on the ground." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8wpvHELb2TPLrXCayXfE9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-google-pixel-9a-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">2.

The vibrant 6.3-inch display is only slightly larger than the Galaxy S25, while the 2,700 nits of peak brightness and 120Hz refresh rate makes the screen an absolute pleasure to use (assuming you don't suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">PWM sensitivity</a>). Under the hood you'll also enjoy Google's powerful Tensor G4 processor, 8GB of RAM, and some feature-packed cameras that are nearly unrivalled at this price point. </p><p>All of that is well and good, but the Pixel 9a's 5,100mAh battery is where the device really shines. In all of our testing, we found that the midrange phone could easily last two full days with casual use, while heavy gaming, streaming, and AI use gave us a full day of battery life before the Pixel 9a needed another charge. </p><p>The problem is that once the phone <em>does</em> need juice, the 23W charging speeds are a bit slower than we'd like. Nevertheless, when you pair the Pixel 9a's flagship-level specs with the accessible price tag and yes, eSIM support, you get an affordable device that's worth a closer look. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">3.

Sure, Motorola has been producing excellent foldable phones for years, but a new addition to the Razr lineup that costs over $1,000? Sounds more like a Samsung move to me, and not in a good way. </p><p>Fortunately, my concerns were swiftly allayed, as the Razr Ultra might literally be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">best flip phone</a> ever made. With this new release, Motorola has taken everything it's learned making Razr phones over the past few years and packed it into a super-premium, super-powered device. The Ultra comes equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 16GB of RAM for powerful performance, plus you'll enjoy an all-day battery with fast 68W charging. Both the inner and outer pOLED displays on the Razr Ultra (2025) are vibrant and functional, and the upgraded titanium hinge feels sturdy enough to last for years. </p><p>True, the Ultra's price tag is still a bit of a problem, and some may wonder if Motorola really <em>needed</em> to make a premium flip phone when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr Plus</a> already checked a lot of the same boxes.

The phone also has support for two Nano SIM cards <em>and </em>eSIM, which is awesome when you have an unlocked phone and travel frequently. </p><p>If I had to be nitpicky, I'd say the OnePlus 13's biggest faults lie in the limited AI features and six years of software support (Samsung and Google are both guaranteeing seven years these days). And if you're based in North America, you may have trouble accessing the phone's full potential through your wireless carrier, <em>especially </em>if you use an MVNO. OnePlus 13 deals are also pretty uncommon, which means you might need to buy the phone unlocked at full price if you're shopping outside of a major sale event. </p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><p>Given the ubiquity of eSIM compatibility in recent smartphones, it's no wonder that this list looks a lot like our regular guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> of 2025. Indeed, picking the best eSIM-compatible phone is basically the same as choosing a great Android device for any use case, but there are a few details to consider before you make your purchase.</p><p><strong>Carrier restriction: </strong>If you buy a phone that's locked to a specific wireless carrier, you'll only be able to use that carrier's network when traveling, thereby removing a lot of the convenience and flexibility of an eSIM. In other words, if you found a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra deal</a> through your wireless carrier, double check the company's locked device policy. Verizon, for instance, won't let you unlock your phone until 60 days after its purchase, making things tricky if you have a big trip coming up. </p><p><strong>Dual-SIM: </strong>Some of the best eSIM-compatible phones also support dual-SIM, which means you're getting the convenience of both a virtual eSIM and <em>at least</em> one physical SIM card slot. The problem is that many manufacturers aren't clear about their device's dual-SIM compatibility. Some devices that support dual-SIM in Europe, like the Motorola Razr Ultra, for instance, lack the feature in the US market. If you'd like a phone with dual-SIM support, check the product listings closely and do a bit of research before you commit. </p><p><strong>Other considerations: </strong>Of course, every traveler has their own priorities when shopping for a new phone. When it's your turn to make the purchase, consider what kind of user you are before settling on a product. </p><p>For example, do you need a phone that's rugged enough to take on the trail? The OnePlus 13 might be the best pick for you. Do you need all of the latest camera features to expertly document your travels? Then perhaps the AI-boosted Pixel 9 Pro is the right choice. Needless to say, if you're looking for a great phone with eSIM-compatibility, you can't go wrong with any of the options listed above, it might just take a little extra research to find your dream device. </p> ]]></dc:content>

The former ran a survey, seeking to identify the changes in online habits by users when it comes to scams and other malicious attempts. According to the research, "over 60% of US consumers perceive an increase in scams over the past year, with one third personally experiencing a data breach."</p><p>While this number seems high (and is undoubtedly is), Google says the data points toward positivity. It states that while users are seeing more scams online, they've felt more "confident in their ability to spot" and avoid them. The other side of this is 61% of users in the survey stated the majority of these scams appeared via email.</p><p>Witnessing and spotting scams at such a high number makes senses when you factor in Google's other discovery: "Half of Americans — and over 60% of Gen Z — spend at least 5 hours on their phones per day."</p><p>However, the way we manage ourselves online, such as keeping our accounts safe, isn't the same. Google and Morning Consult find that our perception of a "safe account" differs between the generations. For Gen X and Baby Boomers, they all prefer concrete passwords that you either have to remember or write down. Google states "over 60%" of people in these generations use passwords, leaving the other 30% to rely on social sign-ins.</p><p>The complete opposite is Gen Z, which reportedly leverages new sign-in methods like passkeys or social sign-ins — Millennials, too.</p><h2 id="spot-malice-cut-it-2">Spot Malice & Cut It</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:646px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.88%;"><img id="ooXk6xNch6sFiTpf7w69dC" name="google-pixel-march-feature-drop-suspicious-texts" alt="Google is rolling out scam detection measures for texts and calls on the Pixel 9 and 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ooXk6xNch6sFiTpf7w69dC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="646" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While there is still a vast majority of Americans who prefer using passwords, Google highlights a few protections to utilize. Tools like the Google Password Manager, 2FA (two-factor authentication), and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-authenticator-security-material-you-redesign">Google Authenticator App</a> give those written credentials more power against attackers.</p><p>Although, we shouldn't forget that Google has been walking this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-brings-passkeys-to-android-and-chrome">path of a passwordless future</a> for a while. As such, the company draws awareness to other sign-in options, like passkeys. Moreover, the company states opting to create accounts with "Sign in with Google" is another viable choice. The post states choosing this option will give you the security of your Google Account wherever you're going — plus, you won't have to memorize <em>another </em>password!</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Google has been stepping up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">scam/fraud detection capabilities</a> in recent time. In its March feature drop, the company introduced a treasure trove of scam detection features for phone calls and texts in Google Messages. If something in the call or text triggers the software, users will be promptly alerted and told to avoid further contact.</p><p>Google brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-android-scam-spam-notification-gemini-protection">similar advancements to Chrome</a> on Android, too, thanks to Gemini. The browser's Safety Check stepped its game up, keeping an eye on malicious notifications and more.</p><p>In May, Google published its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fraud-advisory-update-informs-users-threats">latest fraud advisory findings</a> to keep uses on their toes when online.

The lightweight design ensures they don't cause any fatigue even with extended use, and they're comfortable to wear; they're not bulky at all, and deliver a snug fit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3AcqQXyJPNJUeFv9Ry8ihV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3AcqQXyJPNJUeFv9Ry8ihV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Buds 2 feature a 11 custom driver with Dirac tuning, and they sound fabulous. The bass in particular has good vibrancy, and it delivers a tight rumble that makes listening to most modern music highly enjoyable. The mids are clean, and you get a decent treble without any harshness. There's an equalizer that allows you to change the balance between the frequencies, and an Ultra Bass mode that cranks up the low-end energy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="G3mkfwqoqArriNpkzugCgV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3mkfwqoqArriNpkzugCgV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, the Buds 2 are the best-sounding budget earbuds, and Nothing deserves credit for not omitting features on the buds. They don't get AptX codecs or LDAC, but you get really good noise isolation, and it did an effective job tuning out the chatter of my mechanical keyboard (a Lemokey L5 HE) and the air con. The buds managed to last just over six hours, and that's quite good; there's also a fast charging mode that delivers over two hours of music playback with just a 10-minute charge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5040px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cu6voF8MWULwuTxyuP5XhV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cu6voF8MWULwuTxyuP5XhV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5040" height="2839" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the Buds 2 Plus, they last just as long as the regular model, and the key addition is LDAC codec integration. Considering LDAC has been baked into Android for over half a decade now, you'll get higher bitrates if you're using a lossless source. The Buds 2 Plus have a slightly bigger 12mm driver that has a bit more grunt in the low-end, and they're just as clean with the mids and treble as the regular model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4812px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="vCSPnGD3tYjfJG5ZnTxAVV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCSPnGD3tYjfJG5ZnTxAVV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4812" height="2710" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What I like the most is that the Buds 2 Plus have a custom sound profile that adjusts the audio based on your hearing; you take a test wherein you select what range of frequencies you're able to hear, and it tailors the sound accordingly.

The Chinese manufacturer rolled out one hit after another; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a> was fabulous, and then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> came along, beating every other phone at taking photos and videos. Vivo built on that momentum with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>, which is easily one of my favorite devices of 2025.</p><p>And now there's the X200 Ultra, which has a new design and even better cameras than its predecessor. Annoyingly, the phone isn't launching outside China; Vivo continues to limit its best phones to its home market, and it's having a hard enough time ensuring the device is in stock in the country.</p><p>So if you want your hands on the X200 Ultra, you'll need to go the reseller route. While I don't usually advocate it, the X200 Ultra is an outlier — it is no less than the best phone I used in 2025, and it easily outscores every other rivals in meaningful areas. I wasn't sure how Vivo could improve upon the X100 Ultra, but the X200 Ultra proves that it is possible.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Pricing and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7pzcNX3AD8rurDfsFuHzMS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra back view highlighted against grey background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7pzcNX3AD8rurDfsFuHzMS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo unveiled the X200 Ultra on April 21, and the phone is now available in China. The base model has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and it costs 6,499 RMB ($902) in the country. The 16GB/512GB model costs 6,999 RMB ($971), and there's a 16GB/1TB model that's 7,999 RMB ($1,112).</p><p>The device continues to be sold out in most variants, and as of writing, only the 16GB/512GB edition is available. Just like Xiaomi, Vivo is rolling out a custom edition that includes a Photography Kit, and this has the 16GB/1TB variant of the phone along with a dedicated hardware lens, case, camera attachment, and other extras. This is the variant I'm using, and it costs 9,699 ($1,346) in China.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.82-inch LTPO3 AMOLED, 120Hz, 3168x1440, Dolby Vision, 4500 nits max, Armor Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OriginOS 5 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, Adreno 830, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.28-inch Sony Lytia LYT-818, 35mm, 4K120 video, gimbal OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.28-inch Sony Lytia LYT-818, 14mm wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>200MP Samsung HP9 telephoto, 85mm, 3.7x optical zoom, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.5 with autofocus, 4K60 video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 global 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS, satellite connectivity (1TB model)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, 24-bit/192kHz, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6,000mAh silicon battery, 90W charging, 40W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.1 x 76.8 x 8.7mm, 229g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>White, Red, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-design"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5174px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="hMVLVxwChWMiw8kuNkChYS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra next to X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hMVLVxwChWMiw8kuNkChYS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5174" height="2914" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Brands don't really change their designs all that much these days, and that's true of the X200 Ultra as well. The phone is a massive slab, and coming in at 229g — the same as last year — it is one of the heaviest around. To be fair, all of the Ultra models this year are on the heavier side as they switched to 6,000mAh batteries (outside of the S25 Ultra, obviously), and to its credit, Vivo did a good job with the weight balance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vLBU7aJWCcbzZJZAGhYiGS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra next to X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vLBU7aJWCcbzZJZAGhYiGS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The back of the X200 Ultra is dominated by a gargantuan camera island; the phone houses four camera modules at the back, and given the size of each unit and the resolution you're getting, it's no wonder that the housing takes over a third of the back.

Video stabilization is decent out of the box, and there's an ultra stabilization mode that basically gives you clean footage while shooting handheld on the move.</p><p>You get a good range of shooting modes, and there's portrait video this time, giving you the ability to shoot video with a consistent background blur. The camera viewfinder has all the modes easily accessible, and you get Zeiss effects that alter the look of photos. I used the Vivid profile most of the time as it provides a vibrancy to the photos with high contrast, but there are a half-dozen effects available.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

camera shoots at a 35mm focal length now, with the wide-angle lens at 14mm, and the telephoto hitting 85mm. The phone has the best wide-angle lens of any device I used, and Vivo deserves credit for using the same module as the main camera — it makes a noticeable difference. Predictably, the wide-angle lens takes photos of the same caliber as the main camera, and that's just great to see.</p><p>The 50MP main lens is the best around, and it overshadows anything that Google, Samsung, and Xiaomi have to offer. I'll do a dedicated camera review of the device with the external lens, but the gist of it is that the main camera has better dynamic range and color vibrancy than the 1-inch main sensor on the X100 Ultra, and that is an achievement in and of itself. It delivers incredible shots in challenging situations, and even with little to no visible light, it produced images with plenty of detail and clarity.</p><p>What I like the most about the phone is its portrait shots; Vivo has proven over the last year that it knows how to deliver stunning portrait photos, and the X200 Ultra continues this trend. The phone takes shots with excellent detail and faultless background segmentation, and this is a key reason why I continue to prefer Vivo's phones over OPPO and Xiaomi.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5169px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="ACePS75iSGBd7gPceXmbkS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra with external lens and all the accessories" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ACePS75iSGBd7gPceXmbkS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5169" height="2912" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a similar vein, the 200MP telephoto is nothing short of extraordinary. The HP9 module is the best available today, and Vivo once again put it to great use, delivering crystal-clear shots at 3.7x and beyond. I was able to get usable shots at up to 30x, and it remains the best tele lens of any flagship you can buy today. Like last year, it doubles as a macro shooter, and you get decent detail in this mode.</p><p>Overall, the X200 Ultra is the best camera I used yet; it does a better job than last year's X100 Ultra, and there isn't any other phone that's able to measure up to it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-software"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Software</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="eyhTJLDixfHbt8QpuQ3WcS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra Android 15 Easter egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eyhTJLDixfHbt8QpuQ3WcS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to other Vivo phones in China, you get OriginOS 5 instead of Funtouch OS 15 that is standard on global models. I like what Vivo is doing with OriginOS; the interface is fluid, and you get extensive customizability with exclusive features that aren't available in the global build.</p><p>Using a phone with a China-focused build isn't anywhere as limiting as it used to be just a few years ago; you can easily install the Play Store from Vivo's app store, and once that's done, you can sign in to your Google account (you'll need to go into settings to enable basic Google services), and then set up the phone as you would any other device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rbj8mgzF3wAy3dcpaT3yiS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra notification shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rbj8mgzF3wAy3dcpaT3yiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I didn't see any issues with Google Pay or my usual banking utilities, and for the most part, it was just as seamless as using the global X200 Pro. However, there are two limitations: push notifications from WhatsApp and Gmail continue to be hit-and-miss, and in the case of WhatsApp, that included calls. Even if you disable battery optimization (which is enabled as standard), it doesn't make much of a difference.</p><p>I wasn't able to set up the Pixel Watch 3 with the phone — it just wouldn't connect to the smartwatch, and the app crashed constantly. So if you need to use a Wear OS smartwatch, know that you can't pair it with the device. Outside of these issues, there are no problems with using the X200 Ultra as a daily driver.</p><p>When it comes to updates, the X200 Ultra will receive four Android OS updates alongside six years of security updates, and while that is on the lower end of the scale, it is what Vivo guarantees on all of its devices. I would have liked to see at least five years of updates, but that isn't the case.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-the-alternatives"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: The alternatives</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h2SeJ4hRpM2dXCPSnjMv6F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2SeJ4hRpM2dXCPSnjMv6F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Chinese manufacturers are doing a good job with their Ultra models, and the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has better cameras than last year and a design that's easier to hold and use. While it doesn't quite measure up to the X200 Ultra — I still prefer Vivo's camera tuning and auxiliary lenses — the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is sold globally, and doesn't cost as much as the X200 Ultra, making it a decent alternative.</p><p>The Find X8 Ultra is the closest rival to the X200 Ultra, delivering a similar caliber of cameras and all the other extras. Like the X200 Ultra, the Find X8 Ultra is limited to China and isn't launching in other regions, so it is just as difficult to get a hold of if you're outside the country. Out of the two, I'd get the X200 Ultra; Vivo's software continues to be better, and the design is cleaner.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5139px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xfxdMXcoahvQKV9qTtFodS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra back view against a grey background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xfxdMXcoahvQKV9qTtFodS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5139" height="2895" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need the best cameras</li><li>You want a phone with versatile lenses</li><li>You want a bright AMOLED with useful customizability</li><li>You need reliable battery life</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need global warranty</li><li>You want hassle-free software</li></ul><p>Vivo once again managed to deliver the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best camera phone</a> of the year, and the X200 Ultra doesn't have any notable shortcomings.

In the most recent round of leaks, a tipster took to X to "confirm" that the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"> Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 </a>will both allegedly launch with the same price tag as their predecessors (as spotted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/03/galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-prices-wont-change/"> 9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Samsung has done this earlier with the Galaxy S25 series, keeping the price tag intact and bearing any potential added manufacturing costs that came with the new phones.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Confirmed News" Few Countries will get Price Increases, while Most of Markets will keep Prices Similar to the Previous ones.1899$ | 1099$ https://t.co/vsAqEYQyPZ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1929167217167380777">June 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The tipster adds that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be priced at $1,099, while the Z Fold 7 will start at $1,899, in most markets. This suggests that Samsung may still adjust device pricing in certain areas, particularly in the U.S., due to the highly volatile tariff situation.</p><p>President Trump recently announced that phones manufactured outside the U.S. will be hit with 25% tariffs, which includes Samsung as well. This could mean that all Samsung devices imported into the U.S. could see a 30-40% price hike. This means the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could cost a whopping $2,500, leaving customers to bear the brunt of the rising cost if they plan on buying the device.</p><p>However, it is essential to note that the U.S. Court of International Trade judges <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-court-trump-recent-tariffs-halted-illegal-ieepa">ruled to halt</a> President Trump's recent 10% tariffs on "virtually every U.S. trade partner." The judges state that the administration's leverage of the IEEPA shouldn't qualify here, and that Trump has "exceeded" any rightful authority.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1409px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-floating" alt="A supposed rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, showing its real panel with a vertical triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1409" height="786" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, Samsung has not made any official announcement on its pricing strategy in response to U.S. tariffs. However, it seems that the Korean OEM will be left with limited options when it comes to these tariffs; either they will absorb the tariff costs or pass them on to consumers, and it seems highly likely that the company will end up doing the latter.</p><p>We got to see this firsthand when OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-releases-with-a-hefty-price-tag-in-the-us-and-we-dont-know-why">increased the cost</a> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on" target="_blank">OnePlus Watch 3 </a>without any official announcement, only in the U.S., and later brought the price down to $350, up $20 from the original price.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

While several people were lauding Samsung for creating a device that is slimmer (5.8mm) than a standard pencil, many were questioning why Samsung chose to trade battery for its design, as the device comes with a 3,900 mAh capacity, making users of the device reach for their chargers more often than not.</p><p>Another report posted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/signs-of-poor-galaxy-s25-edge-sales-samsung-in-trouble/"> SamMobile </a>last month indicated the same slow sales scenario with Galaxy S25 preorders as well.

That said, it has only been four days since the device's in-store sales began, and considering that the phone is still fairly new, only time will tell if sales begin to pick up.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite some of its drawbacks, the Galaxy S25 Edge still has its perks.

With its 12.1-inch display, it's right in that "almost perfect" range for many, being smaller than something like the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, but still being large enough to enjoy watching videos or getting some work done.</p><p>Speaking of which, a new version of the OnePlus Stylo was also released along with an updated detachable keyboard. Neither of these comes in the box, which is a bit of a bummer, but the new keyboard has a few upgrades of its own. For one, it can be removed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">Pad 2</a> and will remain connected thanks to Bluetooth. Plus, there's an NFC chip built into the wrist rest, making for easy file transfers from your phone to the tablet.</p><p>Performance is no slouch either, thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-vs-8-gen-2-vs-a17-pro-benchmarks">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. Although it's not the latest and greatest chip to come from Qualcomm, there's really not much that the Pad 2 can't handle. Best of all, the OnePlus Pad 2 won't put too big a dent in your wallet. Even when pairing it with the Stylo 2 and Smart Keyboard, you're looking at a total price of under $800.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hv8NUhNFFZwdogshxor4cR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-9" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Samsung DeX with multiple windows open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hv8NUhNFFZwdogshxor4cR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">2.

Its 14.6-inch display is larger than many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>, while being both slim and lightweight. Samsung also includes its excellent S Pen in the box, something that we're surprised and thankful to see on a yearly basis.</p><p>The continued rise in popularity of AI features helped spark a peculiar change for Samsung as it opted for the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ as opposed to a Qualcomm chip. Samsung explained that it chose this SoC specifically because of its AI capabilities, which is quite important given the company's focus on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p><p>This focus on AI continued with the release of an updated Book Cover Keyboard, which now dons a dedicated AI key. However, that will set you back another $350, so you might be better served by finding the Tab S9 Ultra's keyboard case to save a few bucks.</p><p>Samsung got a lot of things right with the Tab S10 Ultra, but it's still quite expensive. Even when accounting for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>, this tablet lacks any cellular connectivity, which is a decision that still has us scratching our heads.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-for-gaming"><span>Best for gaming</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="syLPuURwsQ4nYproGe7Vrh" name="lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-usb-ports-highlight-promo-render" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 dual USB-C ports highlight promo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/syLPuURwsQ4nYproGe7Vrh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-2"><span class="title__text">3.

Lenovo solved this problem already with its Y700 series of tablets, but those were limited to certain regions, and the U.S. was not one of them. Thankfully, that's no longer an issue as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-announced">Legion Tab Gen 3</a> is essentially the Y700, but rebranded for this market.</p><p>It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, along with excellent battery life. All of that excellence is packed into an 8.8-inch IPS display, complete with a 144Hz refresh rate. You might be disappointed by the lack of AMOLED or even Mini LED, but this Lenovo has managed to source some of the best IPS panels we've seen, and that includes the Legion Tab Gen 3.</p><p>The Legion Tab Gen 3 provides an excellent mobile gaming experience, especially when paired with a telescopic controller. However, thanks to the smaller display and compatibility with the Tab Pen Plus, it actually does a pretty fantastic job as a digital notebook. There's even a "desktop mode," which isn't something we expected to see on a tablet of this size.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-connectivity"><span>Best connectivity</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1434px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="HxdUykyZJeGbAyWLCXCved" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-promo-render" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HxdUykyZJeGbAyWLCXCved.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1434" height="807" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="4-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-2"><span class="title__text">4.

The reason for this is that it might help determine whether having built-in cellular connectivity is worth considering. Sadly, there just aren't very many <em>good</em> Android tablets with a 5G chip built-in, as even Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is relegated to "Wi-Fi Only."</p><p>Even if the Ultra came with 5G, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Galaxy Tab S10 FE</a> would probably still be our recommendation. It sports a smaller 10.9-inch display, making it a great size for being a travel companion, while also including an S Pen in the box. Samsung also offers two different Book Cover Keyboard options, although you'll have to pay a bit more for either of those.</p><p>And when it comes to getting work done, Samsung DeX is just a couple of taps away. While the Exynos 1580 might not be able to keep up with some of the other options on this list, it's still more than capable of being a workhorse. But when the time comes to sit back and relax, the Tab S10 FE is great for that too, and you won't have to worry about finicky hotel Wi-Fi just to watch some YouTube or Netflix.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-compact"><span>Best compact</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WfKEvaGqmBb72EWgP4Z7nT" name="boox-palma-2-white-black-examples" alt="The Boox Palma 2 in white and black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WfKEvaGqmBb72EWgP4Z7nT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Boox)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-onyx-boox-palma-2-2"><span class="title__text">5.

Not just while you're traveling, but also when you're back in the comfort of your own home. If you're looking for something that can also replace an aging or cumbersome laptop, then you'd want something that can be paired with a detachable keyboard.</p><p>If you plan on just lounging around at the pool and want to read a new book that just came out, then we'd recommend checking out an E-Ink tablet. Plus, some of them can serve more than one purpose, so you can reply to emails for awhile and when you're done, read your favorite books.</p><p>While there are a multitude of factors to consider, it's also important to think about whether you're <em>really</em> going to use the tablet. You might just end up opting for a completely different tablet than the one that you were originally considering.

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>Chances are, you've used an Amazon Kindle before. The first time I set my eyes on that gorgeous paper-like display told me it was the future of display technology, but its obvious limitations meant that future was likely decades away.</p><p>As we near the 20th anniversary of the first Kindle, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions">E Ink is better than ever</a>. It not only supports thousands of colors for a more magazine-like experience, but with refresh rates at around 40Hz, it's finally good enough for all kinds of content, not just books. As a result, we've got E Ink tablets, monitors, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">smartphones that can do basically everything you need</a>.</p><p>But another display technology may replace it in most devices. It's called Transflective Liquid-Crystal Display or Reflective Liquid-Crystal Display, often abbreviated as RLCD. RLCD takes a "traditional" LCD subpixel structure and gives it the reflective properties of E Ink, making it visible in any kind of light without using a backlight, all with up to a 120Hz refresh rate. It sounds like a win-win, but like anything, it's not without its faults. Let's break them down.</p><h2 id="daylight-meet-computer-2">Daylight, meet computer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qM3oqSdt7CnykDqXyHUgA9" name="daylight-computer-youtube-gardening" alt="Looking up YouTube gardening videos on a Daylight Computer in direct sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qM3oqSdt7CnykDqXyHUgA9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've been using a tablet for the past few weeks called the Daylight Computer. While the tablet is typically marketed toward the same crowd that would be interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rise-in-minimalist-phones">a minimalist phone</a>, I'm most interested in it because I can use it outdoors during the summer without squinting my eyes.</p><p>The tablet itself doesn't look particularly special at first glance, but its design is thoughtful and impressive in a way that doesn't shine on a spec list. It has sizable bezels, which is <em>actually beneficial</em> on a tablet, as it provides a convenient area to hold.</p><p>The back of the Daylight Computer is made of a soft-touch material, giving it grippiness that aluminum tablets don't have. Plus, it's got a nice contour that fits your hand, unlike the rest of the overly thin and flat tablets.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2f5_1kGLY60" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>And while these design traits are wonderful, it's the display that really shines for me, pun fully intended. Go outside, turn off the backlight, and enjoy the brightest, fastest display you've ever seen. It's 120Hz, so it's liquid smooth, no matter what you're doing. More importantly, the refresh rate ensures that it doesn't feel slow or sluggish, unlike even the fastest E Ink displays.</p><p>Daylight Computer's founders ensured that the bespoke display was 100% flicker-free. While many displays claim to be flicker-free via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tuv.com/usa/en/eye-comfort.html">TUV Rhineland certification</a>, most of the time that means there's no <em>perceivable</em> flicker, not that the display is actually <em>flicker-free</em>. Daylight Computer is fully flicker-free, doesn't use color dithering or FRC, and is completely eye-safe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1ZZT5bVNA">based on my own testing</a>.</p><p>Its reflective nature also ensures that it works perfectly in any kind of light, and the dual color backlight means it's comfortable to use even in dim light. I particularly love that there's no perceivable ghosting, the way many LCDs suffer from, and the backlight doesn't have that faint glow that most LCDs have, either.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xGH3wHqCQitU56dZFK4HHN" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-03" alt="Reading the Android Central home page on a Daylight Computer and an Onyx Boox Tab Ultra in direct sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGH3wHqCQitU56dZFK4HHN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not the first RLCD device by any means, but it's one of the best examples of how good the technology can be. Of course, like any technology, there are a few downsides. First, Daylight Computer's RLCD is black & white only. While it'd be fair to assume this was done for "minimalist purposes," it was actually due to reflectivity, according to the company's founder and CEO, Anjan Katta.</p><p>Katta told me that transflective LCDs become significantly dimmer when color is added to the mix due to the way pixel color filters operate. As a result of testing, the company decided that daylight visibility was more important than color. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPPsgGndJ48">This review</a> of the HannsNote 2, a color RLCD tablet, shows this off well.

As with any display technology, the answer depends on your needs. E Ink has been the go-to standard for a long time for anyone concerned with eye health and the negative effects of backlights with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, but RLCD is also completely flicker-free.</p><p>In fact, it's more flicker-free than any current E Ink product because the 120Hz refresh rate falls in the safest range, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">according to research</a>. E Ink needs to refresh the display fully from time to time, and the relatively slow refresh rate (under 40Hz) has the potential to bother people susceptible to epilepsy.</p><p>E Ink also heavily relies on using specific screen modes relative to the content. Faster refresh rates used for videos and website scrolling reduce the overall contrast and detail in order to make E Ink's magnetic dots move faster. RLCD uses a traditional display pixel structure, so the lights are either on or off and don't need to change modes for different content.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CQevW8h8Y5DdEC6MhBmRTf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-viewing-angles" alt="Comparing the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD at an extreme angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CQevW8h8Y5DdEC6MhBmRTf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EW5UGZWHUeM2qu5T2LefSf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-shade" alt="Comparing the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD in the shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EW5UGZWHUeM2qu5T2LefSf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VZz5x4cER2RdZjBMVYBnQf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-devices-off" alt="Comparing the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD with the displays off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VZz5x4cER2RdZjBMVYBnQf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The RLCD screen on the Daylight Computer produces more detail than any of the E Ink tablets I have because of its higher contrast image, but it still somehow comes off looking "softer" than E Ink. Preference will dictate which look you prefer, but there's no denying the difference in contrast the Daylight Computer's RLCD provides.</p><p>Furthermore, color RLCD has issues with contrast on deep colors, based on existing color RLCD tablets, while color E Ink looks great across the board.</p><p>Whites on E Ink also look a lot better as they're actually <em>white</em>. The RLCD on the Daylight Computer has a very warm, green tint to it, which doesn't bother me, but it's worth noting as a quirk of the technology. Viewing angles are also poorer than E Ink, but again, I'm not sure how much this affects actual use of the product.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="6fzt4VYBvLthD4BYyqb2bf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-detail-comparison" alt="Comparing the detail of manga on the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6fzt4VYBvLthD4BYyqb2bf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>RLCD also requires constant power to display an image, while E Ink magnetizes the image once, and it stays there until physically changed again. Think of E Ink a bit like an Etch a Sketch; once the image is there, it doesn't go away until you change or erase it.</p><p>That means RLCD tablets like the Daylight Computer can last days on a charge, but E Ink tablets may last weeks, even with regular use. Regardless of this, RLCD's 120Hz performance may be worth the tradeoff. It certainly is for me.</p><p>I've previously used an RLCD monitor, the EazeEye 1.0, and while that was illuminated from behind by natural light to ensure it's bright enough for normal computer use, I'm confident that a bit more time will produce something similar in a tablet that will eclipse color E Ink for most people. The HannsNote 2 is a great start for color RLCD tablets, and I hope to see more color RLCD tablets with great frontlights in the future.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e9b317d5-88c9-425d-8751-9e39057b473f">            <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/product" data-model-name="Daylight Computer"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:120.54%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9DNJdr87RcUKUButr7w7fJ.jpg' alt="A cropped official product shot for the Daylight Computer"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Daylight Computer</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Get ready for a new kind of tablet that challenges assumptions.

I have been testing the Monitor III for almost nine months now, and my love for them has only intensified.</p><p>I had the opportunity to sit down and chat with the lovely team behind the redesign, and it gave me a deeper understanding of just why the Monitor III headphones are so much better than the older iteration.</p><h2 id="better-in-every-way-shape-and-form-2">Better in every way, shape, and form</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GJ7HejCKoVBssKSnw397KY" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJ7HejCKoVBssKSnw397KY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MrQT7WhavCxCrVvuUzgNCY" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MrQT7WhavCxCrVvuUzgNCY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While the redesign isn't a dramatic rethink, it looks a lot more modern and streamlined now. The Marshall Monitor III <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> are made out of recycled aluminum, silicon, and other materials. The engineers prioritized durability and performance without compromising sound quality and comfort.</p><p>The Marshall Monitor III headphones are the most compact pair on the market. You can twist and contort them to fit into the egg-like carrying case, which is made of leather and lined with luxurious red velvet. I found this size ideal for traveling as the case fitted into my carry-on very easily.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wVbm4DtkuUJcTkEiuajmzX" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVbm4DtkuUJcTkEiuajmzX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The earcups are as soft as marshmallows. I have several piercings, and most headphones often don't sit well, pinching me and irritating my piercings. These cups don't do that, which is a welcome change. This wasn't an accident; Marshall tested with glasses, earrings, and a variety of other variables to ensure a comfortable wear experience.</p><p>These removable cups are made of 40% soft foam and 60% slightly denser foam with springs coiled behind the ears. These cushion ears and, at the same time, efficiently block out sound.</p><p>Marshall used this to improve active noise cancellation, as well as newer, more optimised mics. The ANC is adjustable within the Marshall app, and there's a dedicated ANC button to switch modes as well.</p><h2 id="a-win-for-durability-and-repairability-2">A win for durability and repairability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I love the fact that the Marshall team focused on durability and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/repairability-is-finally-going-mainstream-sort-of">repairability</a>, so users will be able to hang on to their Monitor III headphones for a very long time. The brand assured me that each crucial component of the headphones can be replaced within 10 minutes.</p><p>They even redesigned the circuit board with repairability in mind, reducing its 90 soldering points to 10.</p><p>In line with this thought process, the headband is more flexible now. It is made of TPU, not leather, so it can self-repair from minor abrasions and stay strong yet bendy. The cable connecting both cups isn't inside the band. Instead, it is threaded through the silicone flap underneath to make it easily repairable.</p><h2 id="thoughtfully-remade-from-scratch-2">Thoughtfully remade from scratch</h2><p>Much of the internals of the Marshall Monitor III headphones were remade from scratch, including the audio drivers and acoustics, to achieve the desired performance boost. The makers of the headphones benchmarked them against less commercial-sounding studio monitors.</p><p>Tuned with Marshall's signature sound, these headphones deliver the full spectrum of sound with every instrument standing out clearly and getting its moment in the sun.</p><p>The Marshall app for Android and iOS simplifies the process of customizing your Monitor III. This is the main control hub for your headphones where you can adjust the equalizer, choose presets, or customize your own.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="fSkgMXooq9yC7ZXh5gAF63" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III app screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fSkgMXooq9yC7ZXh5gAF63.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="ZyaXGUPz33VGVRNtS8oG63" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III app screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZyaXGUPz33VGVRNtS8oG63.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Users can also customize the M-button, which is the shortcut button that opens Spotify as a default setting.

The brand straight up doubled the battery life, going from 30 hours with ANC on to 70 — that's right, <em>70</em> — hours of playback with ANC enabled. And once you turn the ANC off, Marshall promises up to 100 hours of playback. It's the wildest uptime I have ever witnessed from a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> of this stature.</p><p>I have put this to the test again and again, getting so bold as to charge it once on an international trip. These headphones did not disappoint. No lie was told here. At this point, I often forget when I last charged the Monitor III.</p><p>I enjoyed constant playback on two back-to-back flights, blocking out the agitating sound of in-air turbulence or the plane's roaring engines taking off. It was a sensory delight with no fear of the battery running out at the back of my mind. What a blissful travel accessory!</p><p>As if Marshall didn't spoil us enough with that ridiculous uptime, these headphones support fast charging. A quick 15-minute charge gives you 12 hours of playback. That's an infallible combo.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-the-marshall-monitor-iii-anc-headphones-2">Should you buy the Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones?</h2><p>Personally, I can find no deal-breaking flaw in the Marshall Monitor III headphones. I'd give them a five out of five, but the lack of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio</a> support must be taken into consideration.</p><p>Another small issue that some folks might have with these headphones is the lack of a headphone jack. Many popular brands like Edifier include a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-headphone-adapter">headphone jack to USB-C converter</a> as well as a standard 3.5mm audio cable with their Bluetooth headphones, since they usually support both forms of wired audio playback.</p><p>Marshall chose to forego the standard audio port, though you can still use the Type-C port for wired audio playback. There's also a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in the case, which can be used to connect the headphones to a computer or laptop that has an audio jack.</p><p>However, there's no way these minor drawbacks should hold you back from buying such a great, well-designed product. Something that's designed to last and is easily repairable deserves praise. This pair of headphones is Auracast-ready and has an insane battery life to boot, so I say go ahead and purchase it. You certainly won't regret it!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0d40c8ec-e03d-4f41-aca0-1ea5824846f2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgNt9n6pWoCVoaKSua5PdL.jpg' alt="Marshall Monitor III"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Marshall Monitor III</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star half"></span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="90" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Made to last</strong></em></p><p>The Marshall Monitor III delivers 70 hours of battery life with ANC on, is future-proof thanks to Bluetooth Auracast, and has easily repairable parts that are durable to begin with.

Considering the foldable phone&apos;s steep price tag, these savings could go a long way.   </p><p>The deal is part of the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/"><strong>Discover Samsung</strong></a> event, which is ostensibly a way for the OEM to ditch old stock before unveiling a bunch of new devices in July. Nevertheless, plenty of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> are receiving similarly-great offers during the sale, so take a look if you&apos;re interested in grabbing a new device. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="58434357-2e52-4eef-9937-881a51d67b8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,899.99" data-dimension48="$1,899.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uzsaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:865px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.61%;"><img id="Qk9BrbQMCLYk6ofsRaMfP" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-render-white.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qk9BrbQMCLYk6ofsRaMfP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="865" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 256GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uzsaxaa/" data-dimension112="58434357-2e52-4eef-9937-881a51d67b8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,899.99" data-dimension48="$1,899.99"><del>$1,899.99</del> <strong>From $899.99 with trade-in | $1,499.99 without during Samsung Discover Sale</strong></a></p><p>If you've been waiting for the right time to buy the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy z Fold 6</a>, this might be it. For one week only, Samsung is offering up to $1,000 of instant trade-in credit when you send in an old or broken device, potentially knocking the price of the premium foldable down to $899.99. </p><p>Don't have anything to trade in? Skip that part and you'll still receive $400 off, matching (or beating) the latest pricing from Amazon and Best Buy. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uzsaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="58434357-2e52-4eef-9937-881a51d67b8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,899.99" data-dimension48="$1,899.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Although it wasn&apos;t the dramatic upgrade that we were hoping for, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market today, boasting two gorgeous AMOLED displays, a powerful Snapdragon chipset, and a durable folding hinge that&apos;s (nearly) invisible to the naked eye. Like all of Samsung&apos;s recent devices, the Z Fold 6 also guarantees seven years of security and OS upgrades, and you&apos;ll also receive access to all of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> software features.</p><p>Once again, the Galaxy Z Fold 6&apos;s biggest problem is the price, which is why deals like this are so important. Even if you <em>can&apos;t </em>get the full $1,000 of instant trade-in credit, Samsung is being pretty generous about the old phones it accepts. Devices dating back to the Galaxy S23 Plus will land you $650, while select iPhones could earn you up to $700 off. </p><p>In addition to the instant trade-in credit, Samsung is offering up to 47% off select accessories like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro or Galaxy Watch 7 when you bundle your purchase with the Z Fold 7. In other words, do some shopping during the Discover Samsung sale and you might end up fully equipped with discounted tech before the week is up. </p><p><em>New Samsung foldable phones are coming soon.

One thing users will notice is the Parental Control app now has a cleaner, reworked UI. More importantly, Nintendo announces that the Android app now supports the Switch 2, which is perfect timing as the console is set to launch in a couple of days.</p><p>Nintendo states the app lets parents control a Switch 2's "access to GameChat." Parents can manage which friends their kids can speak to and "when they can use video chat." Additionally, the update gives parents the ability to connect and manage multiple Switch devices, as well as the ability to extend playtime limits with ease.</p><p>When tapping a connected Switch, parents will see a day-by-day breakdown of its activity. If your child has been playing, you will see how long they've played and whether or not you've granted additional time. Parents can then hop into a monthly breakdown to see days played and playtime averages.</p><p>For the playtime limit, parents will find the option to extend it by five, fifteen, or thirty minutes. However, there is an option, marked by Nintendo's Starman icon, to disable the daily limit.

Google today, June 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-public-notebooks/" target="_blank">announced</a> public notebooks are arriving in NotebookLM. With a few clicks, any NotebookLM user can create a public notebook by generating a shareable link to the notebook.</p><p>This might sound similar to how shared files work in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a>, but there are a few key differences. For starters, public notebooks are view-only, so there's no avenue for collaboration on the sources and information within a NotebookLM project. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM</a> is all about customized studying and learning experiences tailored to the specific user, and that isn't changing.</p><p>While a NotebookLM project's sources can't be changed, there are still plenty of ways to interact with a public notebook using AI features. You can create a podcast-style explainer with Audio Overviews, generate an FAQ sheet for simple studying, or have AI write a briefing document. There's also the option of conversing with the Gemini-powered chatbot to ask questions about the source material within the NotebookLM public notebook.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aDWqzqEj9s9BA3Nz6eqsKe" name="Notebook-LM-Public-Notebooks-2" alt="Sharing a NotebookLM notebook with others using the new Public Notebooks feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aDWqzqEj9s9BA3Nz6eqsKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To create a public notebook, users need to click the <strong>Share </strong>button in the top right corner of the NotebookLM and select <strong>Anyone with a link</strong> under the <strong>Notebook access</strong> section.

A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/24379" target="_blank">listing</a> added to the Wireless Power Consortium's database Monday, June 2 revealed that an unreleased Samsung handset gained Qi2.1 certification. That is likely to be the Galaxy Z Fold 7, though some key details are missing.</p><p>The Samsung device added to the WPC database carries a model number of <strong>SM-D637U</strong>, which doesn't match the company's recent pattern for foldables. However, the South Korean tech giant's WPC entries have often featured different model numbers for pre-release products. For instance, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 received Qi certification under the model number <strong>SM-D617D</strong>, whereas its official model number is <strong>SM-F946</strong>. The Galaxy Z Fold 6's entry was similarly unique with a <strong>SC-55E</strong> model number.</p><p>Regardless, this unreleased Samsung phone appears to be the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7. This listing confirms that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-qi2-wireless-charging-support">the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will support Qi2.1 charging</a>, but it's unclear what kind. The WPC made things confusing when it broke off Qi2 into standard Qi2 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">new Qi2 Ready certification</a>. The latter means that a device supports the full technology of Qi2 or Qi2.1, but does not include hardware magnets for perfect alignment and accessory support.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> supported Qi2.1 Ready, and did not include magnets for complete compatibility with Qi2 and MagSafe chargers and accessories. Samsung and the WPC suggest that customers complete the experience by purchasing a Qi2-certified case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1409px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-floating" alt="A supposed rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, showing its real panel with a vertical triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1409" height="786" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the slim form factor of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it stands to reason that this foldable will also support Qi2 Ready — and won't include magnets. For many, this won't be much of a noticeable upgrade over the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both the current and upcoming foldable will charge at 15W, and won't have magnets.</p><p>There's also a clear oddity with this WPC database entry, and that's the power profile listed for this smartphone. It is entered as BPP, or Baseline Power Profile, signaling that the phone only supports 5W wireless charging. Of course, this isn't going to be the case for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, as that would be a clear downgrade.</p><p>If anything, this is a sign that the WPC database entry is somewhat of a placeholder until the Galaxy Z Fold 7's official release, and could be subject to change.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

However, Samsung isn't likely to include built-in magnets, meaning Qi2 Ready support with cases and accessories is the best we can hope for on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. </p></article></section><h2 id="explaining-the-qi2-and-wireless-charging-situation-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-2">Explaining the Qi2 and wireless charging situation on the Galaxy Z Fold 7</h2><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> hasn't been officially announced yet, so we don't know for sure whether it will earn Qi2 certification or pass up on it. With that being said, we can look to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series as a baseline for what we might see on the company's upcoming foldable.</p><p>Like the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, the latest Galaxy S25 supports 15W wireless charging, meeting the minimum standard for Qi2 certification. By comparison, the current Galaxy Z Fold 6 also supports 15W wireless charging, which would be sufficient for the Qi2 standard.</p><p>If Samsung follows the example set by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, it could easily gain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 Ready</a> certification for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 by maintaining the same wireless charging speed as the current generation.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/24379">recent listing</a> at the Wireless Power Consortium for an unknown Samsung device points to Qi2 support. The unreleased device is likely a foldable and could be the Galaxy Z Fold 7, sporting the Qi 2.1.0 spec, the same as the Galaxy S25.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4026px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-11" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4026" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qi2 Ready is a new offshoot of the Qi2 standard that ditches the requirement of magnets. Qi2 requires magnets for perfect alignment with chargers and accessories, whether they're MagSafe or Qi2-certified. However, the Qi2 Ready options passes off the magnets to supported accessories, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/consider-adding-magsafe-adapter-for-android">MagSafe sticker ring</a> or a Qi2 case. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Samsung used Qi2.1 Ready for the Galaxy S25 series</a>, making it fully compatible when paired with a Qi2 case.</p><p>If that sounds confusing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">it's because it is</a>. As a prospective Galaxy Z Fold 7, what you really need to know is that your device will work with all Qi and Qi2 chargers due to its expected support of 15W wireless charging. Since this spec is a carryover from older models, it's a near-guarantee. You'll also need to know that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will almost certainly <strong>not</strong> include magnets, so you'll have to get a case or accessory for full Qi2 support.</p><p>Whether Samsung will apply for Qi2 Ready certification from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-does-not-require-magnets">Wireless Power Consortium</a> is unclear at the moment. Currently, no rumors or leaks point to Samsung actually including built-in magnets on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. It elected not to do so for the Galaxy S25 series, and embedded magnets would be an even trickier task with the limited internal space available within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to retain the same charging speeds as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 across the board. It should support 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-charging-speed">We have all the details here</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b9c4295b-99db-46d3-9f87-37e8a798f7a5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:98.61%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qk9BrbQMCLYk6ofsRaMfP.jpg' alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 render in white"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still the latest and greatest</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still the newest Galaxy foldable you can buy, and it's getting cheaper and cheaper.

Besides the design changes and spec upgrades, the Z Flip 7 is expected to get a modest bump in battery capacity, but charging speeds are expected to stay the same.</p><p>This would include the 15W wireless charging speed from the Z Flip 6, which should be carried over to the Z Flip 7. This would make the Flip 7 compatible with Qi2 charging speeds if you use the right case. It's unlikely the Flip 7 will have built-in magnets for Qi2, which means you'll have to use Samsung's first-party or third-party cases for the phone to work with Qi2 chargers.</p><p>We could be wrong, and the Galaxy Z Flip 7 (and Fold 7 by extension) might just be one of the first Samsung phones to have native Qi2 charging, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence of this just yet. Whether it would have it or not, the Z Flip 7 is primed to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> out there.</p><p>A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/24379">listing</a> on the Wireless Power Consortium for an unreleased Samsung device (likely a foldable) points to Qi 2.1.0 support, which is promising, to say the least.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3874px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ujGY8cB9FwNz6ubVQPJEgW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-10" alt="Close up of an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back of the Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ujGY8cB9FwNz6ubVQPJEgW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3874" height="2179" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qi2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">expected to come to many more phones</a> in 2025, with the biggest push coming from Samsung and Google.

We tested this in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus review</a>, and it worked just as advertised. With a Qi2 case, you'll also be able to use your Android phone with any Apple MagSafe chargers since Qi2 is essentially built on Apple's wireless charging tech.</p><p>Unlike iPhones, however, most Android phones don't have built-in magnets (yet), so you'll need a Qi2-compatible case for your phone to utilize this charging technology. I'm sure we'll start seeing Android flagships with built-in magnets for Qi2 by the end of the year.

There are some rumors that suggest it might be improved, but whether it's the water or dust protection (or both) that'll be bettered remains to be seen.</p></article></section><h2 id="this-is-samsung-s-chance-to-raise-the-ip-rating-bar-on-foldables-2">This is Samsung's chance to raise the IP rating bar on foldables</h2><p>Samsung was the first foldable manufacturer to introduce an IPX8 rating with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3 back in 2023. This was a big moment for folding phones as it meant they were one step closer to offering the same level of durability as standard flagships.</p><p>An IPX8 rating only guaranteed protection against liquids, though, as dust protection was still absent. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a> had dust resistance before Samsung, but Samsung quickly followed with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and Z Fold 6 by introducing an IP48 rating, where the number '4' stands for protection against solid particles. This was still far from proper dust protection, but it was a step in the right direction.</p><p>With much of the industry only now playing catch-up, Samsung is in a great position once again to raise the bar for foldables. Back in April 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/1909739032264728931" target="_blank">Twitter leaker The Galox suggested</a> that the Z Fold 7 could have "improved" water and dust resistance. If this is in fact the case, then there's a good chance the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Flip 7</a> would also have the same level of improvements.</p><p>Whether these improvements would lead to a higher IP rating is still unknown, so we'll have to just wait for the big reveal to find out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qvvbSu5wsvePygZSzmTuKi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-23.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qvvbSu5wsvePygZSzmTuKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Going by the leaks and rumours so far, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 isn't going to be drastically different from the Z Flip 6, except for maybe a few key areas. Besides the usual processor upgrade and new colors, the outer screen of the Z Flip 7 is finally expected to be an end-to-end panel that envelopes the outer cameras, similar to Motorola's Razr series.</p><p>We're certainly not expecting the specs of this new outer display to be anywhere as good or functional as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-camera-review" target="_blank">Razr Ultra</a>, but having a larger panel with (hopefully) more unrestricted functionality would keep fans and new buyers interested.</p><p>Another significant change will be the software, as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will most likely ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a>.

It's still a work in progress, so you might encounter a few bugs, but we're loving the performance and functional improvements Samsung has made to its core apps like Health, Reminders, Routines, Internet, Calendar, Contacts, and a few others.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8534c04f-2db7-42a9-9b7f-e8f8a27243b6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJSqkawF7bfM8eXd6UZgr3.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Blue"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Successor coming soon</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 could be good value soon once it drops in price after the Galaxy Z Flip 7 launches.

With a screen size of 6.7 inches, the Galaxy S25 Edge is around the same size as top competitors like the Galaxy S25 Plus and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Specifically, the Galaxy S25 Edge costs the exact same price as the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Although both phones start at around $1,100, things are far from equal when it comes to these two handsets. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> sports a marvelous form factor, but it had to cut a slew of features to achieve that feat. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is a thick and well-rounded smartphone. If you’re choosing between the two, here’s how the phones compare.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-32" alt="All three colors for the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> is like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, but thinner and without a handful of features. That should give you a general idea of what you’re getting with the new Galaxy S25 Edge. Some of the noticeable differences include a dual-camera system, the smallest battery of any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 model</a>, and a stunning 5.8mm thickness.</p><p>You could make the argument that the Galaxy S25 Edge is the antithesis of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.

The Galaxy S25 Edge features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. It's also plenty bright, with up to 2,600 nits of peak brightness. This is a flagship-caliber display, for better or worse — it'll have battery life implications that we'll get to later.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL features a larger and improved 6.8-inch AMOLED screen, capable of reaching a peak brightness of 3,000 nits. Like the Galaxy S25 Edge, the Pixel 9 Pro XL uses a variable refresh rate panel that can fluctuate between 1Hz and 120Hz depending on the situation.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-14" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On paper, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge might look like the more performant smartphone compared to the Pixel 9 Pro XL.

Its secondary camera options leave much to be desired, though. There's just a 12MP ultrawide lens — no telephoto camera — and a 12MP selfie camera. You do get 2x optical zoom by the way of sensor crop, but that's it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a well-rounded system with three rear cameras. You get a 50MP main camera sensor paired with an upgraded 48MP ultrawide lens. Best of all, there's a 48MP telephoto camera supporting 5x optical zoom. The Pixel 9 Pro XL's secondary cameras will blow the Galaxy S25 Edge's ultrawide camera out of the water.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-battery-life-and-charging-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Battery life and charging</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EQTBiMfFUo4QUp5yXgaFYi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-hands-on-11" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge from the botton, showing the USB-C port, speaker grille, mic, and SIM tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EQTBiMfFUo4QUp5yXgaFYi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life and charging typically don't receive their own section in our comparisons, which is a sign of just how important it is when it comes to the Galaxy S25 Edge. The smartphone has a 3,900mAh battery capacity. That's smaller than the base-model Galaxy S25 while packing the same exact screen as the Galaxy S25 Plus. In other words, the display will draw the same amount of power as it would on the Galaxy S25 Plus while using the much smaller battery on the Edge.</p><p>In our testing, the battery manages to last roughly a full day, but you'll likely be on fumes by bedtime, and power users may not be so lucky. Add in the slow 25W wired charging speeds — another casualty of the phone's tiny battery — and the combination is a recipe for disaster. It's definitely something you need to consider when thinking about buying this smartphone.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is on another planet with its massive 5,060mAh battery capacity. The charging speed isn't <em>that</em> much faster at 37W wired, but it's better than the Galaxy S25 Edge.

At $1,099, you’re paying the exact same price as the Pixel 9 Pro XL while getting arguably worse battery life, a less versatile camera, and a bigger display. On the other hand, the 221-gram Pixel 9 Pro is exactly why the Galaxy S25 Edge exists.

This feature helps users switch between two apps with a single tap, without feeling like the app is squished up when the screen is split. Samsung's Weather app, Reminder, Health, and Auracast also receive major updates with this new release.</p><p>Considering the rollout of the new Beta has just begun, we can expect Samsung to gradually announce more beta versions and compatibility for additional devices.

For about the same price, you could go with a foldable from Motorola or a flagship, non-folding phone from Samsung. When making the comparison between the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, the difference is clear if you know which basic design you want. However, if you’re not yet sure, you might be weighing the pros and cons of both, as these are two very impressive phones for their respective categories.</p><p>We’re here to help by running through how they stack up against one another in all the most important ways.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-the-design-and-basic-features-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: The design and basic features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xFNMPhveqeXd67tk9F6JRC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-37" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 outside in tent mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFNMPhveqeXd67tk9F6JRC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3963" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you think you automatically get a significantly larger screen with the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 since it’s a foldable, think again. The inner screen is indeed an oversized 7 inches, but that’s only marginally larger than the size of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. With that said, the advantage with this phone is that you can also fold it down to half its size and still enjoy the outer 4-inch screen for crucial notifications, selfies, apps, and more.</p><p>The larger inner screen is a punchy and crisp 1,224p AMOLED HDR10+ Super HD with adaptive 165Hz refresh rate, 4,500 nits peak brightness, and is Pantone-validated for ultra-accurate colors and skin tones. The external screen, meanwhile, is a P-OLED HDR10+ 417ppi screen with an adaptive 165Hz refresh rate, as well as a slightly lower peak brightness of up to 3,000 nits.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes in several colors</a>, including Pantone colors Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Train, and Cabaret, as well as the option for a luxe satin-inspired finish or durable leather-inspired finish. Derrek Lee says in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">review of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> that he loves the brushed metal versus glossy frame, advising that it affords a “rustic sheen.”</p><p>There’s also Italian Alcantara if you’re feeling extra special. If you’re not familiar with that material, it’s the same type used for luxury items like bags from Louis Vuitton or premium cars. Finally, opt for an FSC-certified wood housing if you want something a bit more rustic. Bottom line: you get options <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">not just with colors but materials</a>, too.

The hinge is reinforced with titanium, making it strong and able to withstand frequent folding and unfolding throughout its life, more so than the company’s previous generation devices.

You get a higher-resolution Quad HD+ (3,120 x 1,440) Dynamic AMOLED 2x display, but a lesser 120Hz refresh rate. Peak brightness is just 2,600 nits, which is still decent for viewing in bright sunlight. In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">review of the Samsung Galaxy Ultra S25</a>, Andrew Myrick says the screen looks “absolutely stunning.”</p><p>The S25 Ultra is available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-color-should-you-buy">a few more color options</a> than the Razr, including Silverblue, Black, Gray, Whitesilver, and the Samsung-exclusive Jetblack, Jadegreen, and Pinkgold. The phone is built with a strong titanium frame alongside Corning Gorilla Glass Armor 2. It meets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-waterproof">IP68 specifications</a>, making it more resistant to dust and water.</p><p>While this phone isn’t a foldable, it does come with a built-in S-Pen you can use for productivity and creativity tasks. Myrick says he loves the uniform design with flat edges “as far as the eye can see.” But while he says it feels great to hold and use, he admits that it’s also slippery, lacking grip. Once again, a protective case is essential.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-good-lock-one-ui-7-multitasking-01" alt="The grid multitasking UI from a Good Lock module in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Along with support for Dolby Atmos through its stereo speakers, you get 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB storage, affording an entry option for those who don’t require as much storage (though it’s always recommended to get more than you think you’d need).</p><p>The 5,000mAh battery should last all day, and while this phone supports wireless charging, it’s only at half the speed of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025.

Set up multiple app and widget panels to scroll through if you want. The ability to use apps on the cover screen is one of Derrek’s favorite ways to use the Razr, and you get the same experience as with the company’s previous generation foldables.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rzqwwEeeEjnT9H2btEC7KV" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-7-good-lock-lockstar" alt="Customizing the lock screen using Good Lock's LockStar module on One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzqwwEeeEjnT9H2btEC7KV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes loaded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">Android 15</a>.

Andrew's one issue with this phone, when it comes to usability, is that he misses having the external screen of a foldable, which he has found to be invaluable for multitasking.</p><p>One area where the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra excels is in terms of longevity.

Now, it's a product you can actually use as Gemini Live on millions of smartphones — both iOS and Android devices. However, there's a lot more to Project Astra than the live video and screen sharing capabilities that recently became available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> users.</p><p>Focused initially on bringing versatile, multimodal AI capabilities to Android, Project Astra has evolved into a far-reaching research project aimed at achieving Google's vision for a universal AI assistant. That means Project Astra is working on key AI features like agentic intelligence, native audio, memory, accessibility, tool use, and much more.</p><p>In other words, the upgraded Gemini Live experience isn't the finish line for Project Astra — it's just the beginning. If you're curious about all Project Astra encompasses and how it'll affect platforms like Android and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, you're in the right place. Let's break down everything you need to know about Project Astra and how you can try it now.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-project-astra-what-is-it"><span>Project Astra: What is it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5953px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="h3HBCreJv6uMev4xjqHrpE" name="Project-Astra-1" alt="The Project Astra sign at Google I/O 2024." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h3HBCreJv6uMev4xjqHrpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5953" height="3969" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Project Astra is known for a few high-profile applications already, but Google's definition of the project is simple. It's a "research prototype exploring breakthrough capabilities for Google products — on the way to building a universal AI assistant," according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/models/project-astra/" target="_blank">Project Astra website</a>.</p><p>That's a vague explanation of Project Astra, and it's probably on purpose. While the project began as a vector for testing multimodal Gemini support for live audio and video, it's expanded to become much more. Now, parts of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">Project Astra are operating under the Gemini app arm at Google</a>, like the ones working on Gemini Live. Others are still working on experimental prototypes and applications for Google DeepMind.</p><p>Here are a few Project Astra features and applications we currently know about:</p><ul><li>Multimodal live video and screen sharing support (Gemini Live)</li><li>Native audio dialogue</li><li>Proactive responses without lag or interruption</li><li>Context-aware dialogue</li><li>Agent highlighting that understands the context of your device screen</li><li>Tool use and interface control to complete actions on your behalf</li><li>Personalized reasoning specific to the user</li><li>Content retrieval from the web or past interactions</li><li>Multimodal memory</li><li>Visual Interpreter to support the blind and low-vision community</li><li>Integration with prototype Android XR glasses</li></ul><p>Currently, many of these features are still in the prototype stage and are only available to select testers. The big exception is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">Gemini Live</a>, which we'll talk about in detail later.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-project-astra-how-it-works"><span>Project Astra: How it works</span></h2><p>Project Astra is a tweaked version of Gemini with enhanced multimodal and agentic capabilities. For trusted testers, Project Astra is available as a standalone app. It works by utilizing multiple knowledge sources and advanced reasoning to provide more comprehensive assistance than a typical search engine or AI chatbot. This could include Gemini models, information found on the web, visual or auditory cues, data that's on your screen, or personalized knowledge from your Google activity or past interactions.</p><p>It works by quickly processing all these data points at once, and the result is Project Astra being able to communicate with a user in natural language with accurate context. This is achieved by using native audio dialogue that can understand different accents and emotions in 24 languages.</p><p>Newly announced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">Google I/O 2025</a> are Project Astra's agentic capabilities. In other words, the prototype AI assistant will soon be able to take actions on your behalf. It can understand what's on your screen in the context of your conversation, using visual cues to show you where to look. It can also utilize Google features such as Search, Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and more to complete tasks on your behalf.</p><p>You can see this in action in the I/O demo video for Project Astra, which demonstrates how a user can control their phone and solve daily problems hands-free.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JcDBFAm9PPI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>We see the person in the video asking Project Astra to find manuals, highlight key points in PDF files, and call businesses on their behalf. This is a perfect, real-world example of Google's vision for Project Astra. In the end, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-vision-world-model-explained">universal AI assistant</a> should be able to control your phone — and perhaps your computer or smart glasses — without you needing to lift a finger.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-project-astra-features-and-platforms"><span>Project Astra: Features and platforms</span></h2><p>The long-term goal is for Project Astra to expand to multiple platforms, and for now, Google has its sights on smartphones and smart glasses. The company says that this prototype "integrates seamlessly with prototype glasses to see the world as you see it — for an even more immersive and helpful experience."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-5" alt="Android XR prototype glasses and Pixel smartphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After trying the experience on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">prototype Android XR glasses at Google I/O</a>, it's clear Astra aims to bring everything we've already covered — including multimodality, memory, visual analysis, and agentic control — to a wearable form factor. This is a long way out from reaching consumers, as Google's smart glasses aren't expected to hit shelves until 2026 at the earliest.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DBpTh8fifHXNyQzbx6AePW" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-5" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DBpTh8fifHXNyQzbx6AePW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Available now is the Project Astra experience for Android and iOS smartphones, also known as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a>.

The document details the EU's "Ecodesign Regulation," which will soon begin to force smartphone OEMs to provide five years of updates (at minimum) for their devices and consumers.</p><p>There's speculation that this regulation could have a lasting impact on how smartphone makers provide updates globally, too.</p><p>Now, there's a major note to be taken here with this new information: this new five-year rule applies to OS and security updates <em>after </em>"the end of sales." This new rule will also reportedly involve tablets, too. As the publication notes, the change is likely to encourage more "certainty" for consumers when using their devices over a prolonged period.</p><p>This new rule is set to go into effect on June 20, 2025. However, the EU's rules will <em>not </em>apply to devices produced/launched before this date. Any phones and tablets that hit the market after June 20 will have to follow the EU's updated policy.</p><h2 id="android-updates-for-users-2">Android Updates for Users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TV3t5LMRSBccRMwNn8WG6h" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-update-01" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TV3t5LMRSBccRMwNn8WG6h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, the EU's new regulations set for June 20 include some Energy Labelling requirements, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/eu-new-rules-will-shake-up-android-update-policies/">Android Police</a>. These eco-friendly design rules for devices in the EU require manufacturers to state how tough their phones/tablets are to drops/dust/water and to ensure their batteries are strong enough to "withstand 800 charge and discharge cycles while retaining at least 80% of their initial capacity."</p><p>Repairability of a device is also required to be stated by OEMs. Moreover, makers should make sure parts for repair are available for at least "7 years after the end of sales of the product model on the EU market."</p><p>It's worth remembering that Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">just like Samsung</a>, has shifted to a seven-year update cycle for devices.

Does that mean they hear everything around them all of the time?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p><p>Hi Rob. That's a great question that I think a lot of people wonder about: how much does their smartphone or "smart" device actually hear?</p><p>The easy answer is everything. Yes, <em>Always Listening</em> means just that — it is always listening. It has to so it can recognize when its trigger word or phrase was spoken, then it can try to do something useful. This means that all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-integrates-gemini-for-smarter-home-automation" target="_blank">smart home</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-home-compatible-devices" target="_blank">assistant-powered devices</a> from every company, including Amazon, Google, and Apple, must work this way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HoTM2nNJVAhKsstdBNfEY3" name="Nest-Hub-2nd-gen.jpg" alt="Nest Hub next to a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HoTM2nNJVAhKsstdBNfEY3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The better answer is to explain how it's supposed to work, according to the people who make the products and those who have tested them. Always listening doesn't mean always recognizing or always doing something. I'll use a simple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-mini-vs-amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen">Nest Mini</a> as an example, but as mentioned, this is pretty much the same across all ecosystems and platforms. Any sort of AI or assistant on your phone has to work this way.</p><p>As soon as you plug in and set up a Nest Mini, its microphone goes to work. Every sound that it picks up is analyzed using some low-power software and hardware, and unless you've said "Hey Google", that's the end of it.</p><p>If it <em>does</em> think it's picked up its command phrase, other processing starts to happen. The software tries to interpret the words it has heard into commands the device can recognize, and then tries to act on those commands.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="byQxwxMvsUNpH4Ji9er97S" name="Govee-RGBIC-LED-Strip-Lights.jpeg" alt="Govee RGBIC LED Strip Lights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/byQxwxMvsUNpH4Ji9er97S.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>An example is if I say, "Hey Google, turn off the porch light," My Nest Mini catches the phrase Hey Google so it knows it needs to process what comes next. In this case, it uses speech recognition to determine my request, ensures it recognizes a device named "porch light," and then sends a signal to shut it off.</p><p>If it didn't recognize the key phrase of "Hey Google," it would just keep listening for it.</p><p>If it recognized its key phrase but was unable to figure out what was being asked, or if it were asked to do something it couldn't, it would respond with a generic error like "I'm sorry I don't recognize porch light" or "I'm sorry I can't do that".</p><p>If it "thought" it recognized the key phrase, it would try to figure out what to do next as described above. Usually, it can't do anything because we never really asked it to do anything. In that case, it just goes back to listening. But sometimes, it can be goofy and <em>think</em> it found a command and do something you never asked it to do.</p><p>I have a first-generation Google Home here that will start playing YouTube videos out of the blue at least three times a week because it thinks I asked it to do it. Goofy little gadget.</p><h2 id="what-about-privacy-2">What about privacy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA" name="google-nest-mini-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Nest Mini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tech companies are very specific about what their voice-activated devices will do and how they do it. That's good because having something that hears everything could be a little problematic if not kept on a short leash.</p><p>For example, some of the commands it "hears" are recorded and sent back for someone to check. If it was told to turn off the porch light, someone wants to make sure it did turn off the porch light. It does keep track of everything it hears that it thinks is a valid request for a certain amount of time. Some think that this information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/cox-media-group-active-listening-controversy">is sold to advertisers</a>, though the companies making the smart devices say otherwise.</p><p>If it heard something that wasn't a valid request, it won't keep track of it, according to the companies who make them.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fANtCWfwKDAUisnEp6zesm" name="google-pixel-fold-google-assistant.jpg" alt="Google Assistant on a Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fANtCWfwKDAUisnEp6zesm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, this is a very valid privacy concern. Most people don't want Google to spy on everything they say. I know I don't. Not that I'm saying or doing something I shouldn't be (you never know) but it's the fact that it's none of Google's damn business.</p><p>You really only have two choices: trust that it's doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing by only processing and acting on things it thinks are valid requests, or don't. I can't tell you what to choose here, but if you don't trust it, you should totally not use it.</p><p>Myself? I only ever fully trust something I built with my own two hands while I'm using it myself. I do use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant" target="_blank"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini" target="_blank">Gemini</a>, and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini" target="_blank"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> products, but I'm mindful of where, when, and how. I'd never have one in my bedroom, for example. <em>Especially</em> one with a camera. I do not use any voice-activated smart "stuff" through Apple, Microsoft, or Amazon because I only want to worry about one platform getting more than I want to share.</p><p>You probably shouldn't follow my example and decide if you trust it or not, then go from there. Giant tech companies don't care about you as a person, but are almost assuredly doing exactly what they describe with voice-controlled services and products. Not to be kind, but because it's not worth the problems that would arise if they got caught doing something differently.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, HMD Global — which has never made a Wear OS or Android Wear watch — may have two Android smartwatches in the pipeline.</p><p>Frequent HMD Global leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/smashx_60/status/1928116848127525318">@smashx_60</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Leak-HMD-s-first-smartwatches-will-run-Wear-OS-and-have-a-camera.1026975.0.html">NotebookCheck</a>) posted last Thursday that the company would launch the HMD Rubber 1 and HMD Rubber 1S, with both watches running Wear OS.</p><p>The Rubber 1 sounds like the premium model, with a 1.85-inch OLED display, 400mAh battery capacity, Bluetooth 5.3 and WiFi support, NFC payments, HR and SpO2 sensors, and 2MP camera sensor. Given that display size, it most likely uses a squircle display, which would be a first for Wear OS.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HMD RUBBER 1- oled 1.85" display - 5ATM Waterproof - BT5.3, WiFi, NFC, Accelerometer, heart rate, SpO2- 2MP CAM- Wear OS- 400mAh, USB-C, QiHMD RUBBER 1S- oled 1.07" - 5ATM Waterproof - BT5.0, WiFi, Accelerometer, heart rate, SpO2- Wear OS- 290mAh, USB-C, Qi<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1928116848127525318">May 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We don't know what purpose this watch camera would serve, but given that Apple allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-reportedly-cancels-its-apple-watch-with-a-camera-this-could-be-the-reason">canceled its camera-embedded Watch in May</a>, it's intriguing to see HMD take a shot at one. If it faces upward, it could support selfies, face authentication, or video calling; if it points outwards, it could take photos, though not with very good resolution quality.</p><p>We assume the HMD Rubber 1S is the budget model, with a 1.07-inch OLED display, 290mAh battery, Bluetooth 5.0, and no NFC or built-in camera. It does have an accelerometer for step counting and activities, with HR and blood oxygen data for (presumably) health and sleep tracking.</p><p>We don't have any leaked details on price, release date, or whether the HMD Rubber 1 would use the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> or a different version. But the name "Rubber" implies that it may use rubber materials, possibly to make them durable enough to survive rough treatment from kids.</p><h2 id="these-hmd-watches-may-target-kids-rather-than-adults-2">These HMD watches may target kids rather than adults</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4167px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.40%;"><img id="PXYyxQEwrmsSumxQ7rGTaE" name="Galaxy-Watch-for-Kids-press-promo" alt="A press graphic showing various "Galaxy Watch for Kids"-themed Galaxy Watch 7 LTEs with bright silicone protective cases and kid-themed watch faces, plus various Samsung Galaxy S Ultra phones with the Google Family Link app controls showing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXYyxQEwrmsSumxQ7rGTaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4167" height="2350" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notebook Check points out that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_ng/press/hmd-and-xplora-technologies-press-release">Nokia partnered with Xplora</a>, "a leading provider of smartwatches for children," last October. Their promised aim is to deliver "responsible and mindful devices for young people" and "introduce them to the world of technology in a safe and balanced way."</p><p>This is a growing focus for HMD, which also announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-makes-an-android-phone-that-teens-might-actually-want-to-use">HMD Fusion X1 phone for teens</a> earlier this year. And when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kids' smartwatches</a>, many of our current favorites have either one or two cameras, most commonly a selfie cam for calling parents.</p><p>Normal smartwatches rarely need cameras. They need to sync with a phone to work, so why bulk up the watch with an inferior sensor to whatever's on your phone? But a kid may not have a phone yet, as a standalone watch is easier for parents to monitor and prevents too much screen time.</p><p>Google and Samsung announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-and-google-teamed-up-on-new-galaxy-watch-7-experience-for-kids">Galaxy Watch for Kids</a> earlier this year, adding a new version of Wear OS to the Galaxy Watch 7 LTE with dedicated "teacher-approved" kids' apps, activity monitoring via Google Family Link, and GPS-based location monitoring.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iVKQjD5otADiDj3GMDLoyW" name="fitbit-ace-lte-games-01.jpg" alt="Browsing the games list on the Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iVKQjD5otADiDj3GMDLoyW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Fitbit Ace LTE kids watch </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps Google will announce a more general "Wear OS for Kids," one that's designed to work with squircle displays — possibly similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> OS.</p><p>The leak didn't mention LTE calling, GPS geofencing, or other common kids' watch features, so it's not a guarantee that the Rubber 1 series targets kids. It's just the most likely possibility.</p><p>Whatever the target audience, we're just as fascinated by the idea of the first squircle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> shapes its content for rounded display edges; it wouldn't fit a square-shaped display. But if the HMD Rubber 1 has a 1.85-inch OLED display, that's far too large for any normal circular display, making a squircle most likely.</p><p>That would require a serious Wear OS UI redesign for Google. And if it pulls off this redesign for HMD Global, other OEMs like Samsung <em>could</em> use the squircle UI for their own watches, in theory.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d28a6316-8477-430c-8117-028ce86478a7">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fkfzAa3nceSUcsYgLmsYP.png' alt="Render of the green Samsung Galaxy Watch 7"><span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>The current Wear OS watch for kids</span></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 LTE can be converted into a standalone kids' watch, provided you have a Samsung phone to set it up.

They feature a powerful and capable ANC profile and a slick, clean design that buyers love. The biggest downside is probably the headphones' high price tag, so snagging them for under $300 is a certifiably good deal.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="bf246e4d-5080-4f2b-b18a-90893bb54fa3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: $399.99" data-dimension48="Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: $399.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want industry-leading ANC, EQ, and overall audio quality; you need wireless headphones with a mic and clear call quality; you'd like to have headphones with a long battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you prefer a pair of headphones that can be easily folded and stored; you want headphones that will let you charge and listen at the same time; you'd rather spend more on the new Sony WH-1000XM6.</p><p>Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones are our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones#section-best-overall">best wireless headphones </a>for a number of reasons. Backed by Sony's QN1 processor and a dual-noise sensor, the WH-1000XM5s have ANC audio blocking that's more powerful than those of competitors, and the Sony Connect app makes it easy to customize EQ and the overall audio profile.</p><p>These also include multi-point connection, a battery life of up to 30 hours per charge, and fast-charging through a USB-C cable that adds roughly three hours of playback for every three minutes they charge. Additionally, their suite of four microphones allow for crisp call quality and easy access to voice assistants. It is worth noting that these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">noise-cancelling headphones</a> aren't particularly easy to store away, though this isn't a big deal for most buyers.</p><p>Needless to say, if you don't mind spending a pretty penny on the latest headphones from Sony, the recently-released XM6 are the better pick. But if you want premium headphone technology at an excellent price, skip the newer cans and grab the XM5 today.</p> ]]></dc:content>

At face value, it seems like this persistent notification will morph into the song's name alongside the artist and maybe its album title, too. It's still too early to tell, despite Google's development of the shortcut seemingly far in its process.</p><p>As previously stated, Pixel users currently have their Now Playing history to dive into if they have this feature active. If your device is listening for music, it will identify and list those songs on that page. Users can then "heart" their favorite songs or interact with them to receive a YouTube, YouTube Music, or Spotify link. If Google is working on a shortcut for this, one that you manually activate for quicker info, maybe these links will be more forward-facing/present to use.</p><p>Something that might impact more than just Pixel users is Google's apparent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/gmails-new-material-3-expressive-design-is-secretly-hitting-some-inboxes">Material 3 Expressive redesign for Gmail</a>. Some users have reportedly already noticed an entire rework of the layout. Emails will supposedly sit on a dedicated card for added depth. Additionally, the changes seem to facilitate room for more colors, delivering a Gmail UI that is a little more <em>expressive</em>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xrrom-android-16-to-android-xr">which is what Google wants</a>.</p><p>During I/O 2025, the company discussed its biggest UI overhaul, Material 3 Expressive. The whole purpose of this new direction is to design a language that "feels good, makes sense, and helps you do things with ease." More than that, it seems like this will arrive for Android 16, and that's expected to happen in June.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thinness is the name of the game for the S25 Edge and, according to Nelson's research, the phone is "a tad over three-quarters" thick. On the Moh Scale of Hardness test, the device's screen begins displaying scratches at a level 6 before becoming more apparent (and deep) on level 7.</p><p>The titanium sides scratch pretty easily, at least with a sharp box cutter involved. Additionally, Nelson was able to pop the volume and power buttons off the S25 Edge quite easily with it.</p><p>The durability test moves on to some heartache as Nelson scratches up the in-display fingerprint sensor before taking a flame to the screen. For the former, even when scratched quite rigorously, the S25 Edge is still capable of scanning/reading your assigned fingerprint (or thumbprint). Interestingly, after 30 seconds under a lighter, the S25 Edge's display showed no signs of damage.</p><p>More than that, the device surprisingly survived Zach Nelson's bend test. However, Nelson briefly touches on a small compromise to the device's water resistance during this bend test. So check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/yQHFCpO6gHE">the rest of the durability test</a> to see that, and a little about the compromises Samsung had to settle for on this thin phone.</p><h2 id="almost-30-days-later-2">Almost 30 days later</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQHFCpO6gHE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Samsung dropped the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> on May 12, and the device became the fourth official member of the new series. From the leaks to Samsung's official in-person teaser of the device, everyone knew the S25 Edge was designed to be an "even-thinner" phone. Samsung's goal was to strike a balance in power and a premium design despite shaving off a little more.</p><p>The S25 Edge debuted with a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, and a 200MP wide-angle lens.</p><p>Like Zach Nelson also highlighted, the display is akin to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's; however, it lacks much of the glare resistance we've come to enjoy. Moreover, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">in our hands-on</a>, the Galaxy S25 Edge seemed to fare quite well. It was better than expected, but that doesn't mean everything was good, especially with its longevity. Speaking plainly, the Galaxy S25 Edge compromises severely with its battery (remember: they wanted it thin!).</p><p>The phone features a 3,900 mAh battery with 25W wired charging. If you're looking at the Galaxy S25 Ultra or even the Plus, there's a strong argument <em>against </em>the phone in terms of battery life. Nevertheless, if you overlook the compromises, perhaps you've got yourself a new phone.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a95753e5-8a75-40fa-bb46-faecbc2578bc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qR9jhpW8ExE78Mxtp6TGf.jpg' alt="Official render of the Galaxy S25 Edge"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Thin, Powerful Edge</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge bridges the gap between Samsung's powerful flagship phones in a thinner form factor.

Users can pretty easily get over a day or more of battery life, and the 68W charging speeds are unheard of within this phone's typical price range.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus also has an IP68 ingress protection rating, Android 15 with two years of OS upgrades, a high-res selfie camera, and a handful of useful AI features. It also feels satisfying to hold, with a durable build and a luxurious vegan-leather backing, so much so that it almost makes you forget it's normally a $400 phone.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus already earned a spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a> released this year, but thanks to this deal from AT&T, it's become an absolute steal.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It is a mighty successor to the Phone 2 and is also promised to be the most powerful flagship that the company has ever made. A new leak, on the other hand, reveals some specs and pricing of the handset alongside a brand-new product altogether.</p><p>The leak comes from prominent tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rquandt.bsky.social/post/3lqhagruvg22v">Roland Quandt on BlueSky</a>, wherein he has shared that the upcoming Phone 3 next month will be featuring in white and black colorways next to 12GB+256GB and 16GB+512GB storage configurations. Also, the pricing is believed to be starting at €850.</p><p>That said, showing up on the Android Show I/O edition, CEO Carl Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-summer-price-confirmed">confirmed</a> that the Phone 3 is on the way this summer and will cost "somewhere around" £800.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tSRJTR9jhzEwzXDLSVJJD5" name="Nothing-Phone-3-leak" alt="Nothing Phone 3 specs leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tSRJTR9jhzEwzXDLSVJJD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roland Quandt on Bluesky)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tipped pricing is significantly larger than the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> when it launched in 2023. It is still understandable as the Phone 3 is touted to be a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a> from Nothing, unlike the predecessor that targeted the higher mid-range Android phone market.</p><p>Quandt further adds an interesting detail about a new Nothing product, their new pair of headphones allegedly dubbed Nothing Headphone 1. Up until now, Nothing has designed and produced earbuds since the company’s inception, but just last month, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-is-talking-big-for-its-debut-over-ear-headphones-landing-this-summer">teased</a> these headphones in a YouTube video where the design team broke down what they’re after, though they’re still keeping the name a mystery.</p><p>The tipster has also shared the expected pricing of the Headphone, which should be starting at somewhere around €300, and it is also tipped to be coming in black and white color options.</p><p>The details of the upcoming products from Nothing are still scarce. Yet, they appear to be targeting the flagship space, and the signature Nothing design language is also expected. Besides, Nothing was also seen dropping hints about the upcoming Phone 3 as it is believed to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1928058744698482832">dropping the popular Glyph interface</a> this time around in favor of a dotted matrix interface, which the latest teaser from the company indicates to some extent.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone (3).

Now, we’re getting a clearer picture as that fresh look slowly starts landing in some users’ Gmail.</p><p>Material 3 Expressive adds some serious flair with responsive animations that make your phone feel way more fluid. Dismissing a notification now comes with this neat little peel-away motion and a matching haptic nudge.</p><p>Gmail’s latest update (2025.05.11) seems to have synced up with Google quietly pulling the trigger on a server-side change, setting the stage for its Material 3 Expressive revamp. Over on Telegram, SparkRadar caught the visual shake-up in action and shared some snaps of the fresh new look (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gmail-material-3-expressive-better-look-3563125/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>At present, Gmail’s look leans on a bold primary color for most of the main screen. That said, areas like the Search bar, bottom nav, and Compose button stand out with their own accent.</p><p>But with the Material 3 Expressive update, the whole layout gets a makeover. The message list now sits on its own raised card with soft, rounded corners and a lighter backdrop, giving it more depth and focus.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.26%;"><img id="armxpf8u8Ewa95v9UmxLvj" name="Gmail-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive update for Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/armxpf8u8Ewa95v9UmxLvj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.26%;"><img id="cUozbRKTYH2gEwTKBJcEpj" name="Gmail-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive update for Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUozbRKTYH2gEwTKBJcEpj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.26%;"><img id="wPTVUg8PCBAzXTThnf6Dnj" name="Gmail-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive update for Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wPTVUg8PCBAzXTThnf6Dnj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="color-explosion-2">Color explosion</h2><p>The Compose button has also had a glow-up.

Thanks to the new card-style layout, there’s way more room to play with tones and shades, making everything feel more layered and visually dynamic.</p><p>On one Gmail account, the account switcher has popped out of the search bar. Other screenshots still show it tucked inside the search bar, which makes sense since server-side rollouts like this often hit accounts individually and not all at once.</p><p>You can spot the card-style UI making another appearance on the email view screen.</p><h2 id="pill-shaped-swipes-2">Pill-shaped swipes</h2><p>Also, true to Google’s earlier teasers, Gmail’s Material 3 Expressive update brings in a new pill-shaped button animation that pops up when you swipe around.</p><p>Like mentioned before, these design tweaks are rolling out slowly through server-side switches. We’re still waiting to see how the rest of Material 3 Expressive shapes up across the rest of Google’s apps and tools.</p> ]]></dc:content>
