                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I had never seen anything quite like it. As someone who lived in Central Florida for years, hurricanes were common, but the worst I&apos;d ever experienced didn&apos;t come close to a fraction of the destruction left in the wake of Hurricane Helene. However, Florida is different from the mountains of Asheville, which I&apos;ve called home for the past decade, and no one here was prepared for what Hurricane Helene would do to our mountain community.</p><p>I had just gotten home by the skin of my teeth from a trip out in San Francisco for Meta Connect 2024 on one of the last flights to make it out of Atlanta. It&apos;s enough of a miracle that I made it home before the worst of the storm kicked in, but another entirely that the planes were flying at all. I&apos;ve been delayed by normal thunderstorms on countless trips in the past, and yet, here we were, flying just north of a powerful Category 4 hurricane!</p><p>I&apos;m still without power or running water as I write this, but a few important pieces of technology have made life just a little bit easier during this time of crisis. From the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which had a better signal than any other phone in my extensive repertoire of review devices, to little comforts like the joy of a Boox e-reader at night or the soft glow of the Nest Protect in my hallway at night, these few gadgets gave me the sense of connection and normalcy that I needed to have.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-a-line-open-2">Keeping a line open</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="efkMkCbwGAwN2ZpmCnN2d4" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-flex-mode-01.jpg" alt="A Motorola Razr Plus 2024 in flex mode on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/efkMkCbwGAwN2ZpmCnN2d4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The chaos started around 4:45 AM on Friday, September 27, 2024, when our power first went off. We awoke with a start at the distinct sound of a tree falling, followed by a house-shaking thud. After figuring out it wasn&apos;t a tree from our property, we had a few minutes of peace until more trees started coming down, and we knew there was no going back to sleep.</p><p>Dawn brought about a fresh new wave of terror, knocking down more power poles, one of which leaned threateningly toward our chicken coop which, thankfully, never actually fell. It&apos;s still leaning and I&apos;m hoping Duke Energy can come by to get it before things get worse.</p><p>What followed were just a few hours of connection to the modern world before we lost all the amenities we were used to—the power was already out, water from the faucet was slowing, and our phone connection kept going in and out. But while I struggled to get messages through to loved ones, friends, and co-workers over the next few hours, my wife&apos;s Motorola Razr Plus 2024 held strong.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 was the only phone among dozens that has been able to get a consistent signal of any kind.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Neighbors came over asking us if we had cell signal, and while I tried many phones in my possession, all of them were like my neighbors&apos; iPhones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxies</a>—none of which could get a message in or out. My wife was not only able to send a message to the family of an elderly neighbor to let them know he was safe but could also make a few phone calls, one of which was to my dad, who lives deeper in the mountains and actually had to climb to the top of the one where he lives just to get any sort of reception.</p><p>By mid-day, all cell reception was gone—even for her phone—but if it had not been for that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Motorola Razr</a>, precious few of our friends and family would know we were safe for days. After the third day, when we started to get phone reception back, the only phone in the house that got anywhere near a reliable connection was the Razr. I know from years of review experience that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a> often have the best signal strength of any other manufacturer, but it wasn&apos;t until this dire situation that I would find myself truly appreciating this phone&apos;s strengths.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-the-fun-going-2">Keeping the fun going</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="evzqJ7pF7UayPaYtKCn4RV" name="Honor-MagicPad-2-with-keyboard-case.jpg" alt="Writing on an Honor MagicPad 2 with the keyboard case attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/evzqJ7pF7UayPaYtKCn4RV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;ve been extremely sparing with electronics use since there&apos;s no power at all, but it&apos;s still nice to play a game of Minecraft with my son for a short break during the day. Plus, we&apos;ve got a handful of flashlights and reading lights we&apos;ve been using to illuminate our evenings while we walk around to amend our candle usage.</p><p>We&apos;ve also got a handful of e-readers at home, from the Kindle Oasis to several different Onyx Boox readers that have been invaluable at night. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-page-review">Onyx Boox Page</a> is my personal favorite because it&apos;s a rather "Goldilocks" size and weight. It&apos;s not as small as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Palma</a> but not as big and heavy as some of the company&apos;s tablets.</p><p>Having a safe, eye-friendly backlight means we can read and keep entertained after the Sun goes down without having to drain the battery of a flashlight or other light source that&apos;s going to come in handy.</p><p>Another device that has come in handy at night is the Nest Protect smoke alarm in my hallway. While it&apos;s primarily a smoke and CO2 alarm, its best passive function is as a nightlight in the hallway with its backup battery. Considering there are no other lights right now, it&apos;s great to have this, even if I have no idea how long its battery will last.</p><p>Lastly is the wonderful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-magicpad-2-ai-math-equation-digitizer">Honor MagicPad 2</a> I&apos;m typing this on. I love my job and consider writing a hobby that I get paid for, so it&apos;s been soothing to still be able to write things and not have to worry about battery. This tablet is remarkably battery efficient and has lasted for days without a charge despite regular usage. I&apos;ve got the keyboard cover case and the Magic Pen, which makes it great for productivity and entertainment alike.</p>

<h2 id="charge-it-up-2">Charge it up</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Q9TmqfkQgaSaymw3FWzGQ" name="Anker-Prime-battery-plugged-in.jpg" alt="An Anker Prime 27500mAh battery pack charging up multiple devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Q9TmqfkQgaSaymw3FWzGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, all of these require battery power, and two devices helped me keep everything charged.</p><p>I&apos;ve got two Anker Prime batteries, each of which contains a massive 27,500mAh of reserve power. Not only is that capacity immense—roughly five phone batteries worth—but these chargers automatically select the most optimal charging speed for any device I connect to it. That even includes phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> which use a mostly proprietary charging method, but this battery still charges the phone from zero to full in just over 30 minutes. It&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-anker-power-banks">best Anker power bank</a> I have.</p><p>The second is this handy Viture One dock for the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck. It&apos;s a 10,000mAh bank, so while it&apos;s not quite as hefty as the Anker ones, it&apos;s specifically designed with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming devices</a> in mind and has kept things a little more fun during all the downtime.</p><p>We also have a bird feeder with a smart home camera nested inside that charges with a solar panel mounted on our deck. While this charger has been great at keeping the camera powered infinitely, it doesn’t provide enough power to charge a phone or other more powerful device adequately.</p><p>On the bright side, my solar-powered Ring lights around the house all work independently without needing any help, so we can still walk around the yard at night and have some semblance of security before we eventually get power back.</p>

<h2 id="survival-power-2">Survival power</h2>

<p>After this catastrophic incident, I&apos;ve been thinking a lot about what other sorts of devices would help me get through something like it again. While I&apos;ll certainly be spending time on Amazon looking up ideas once this is all over—I&apos;ll definitely be ordering emergency and camping supplies on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Prime Day</a> on October 8 and 9—I&apos;d love to hear from our readers! Do you have a favorite gadget that gets you through camping trips or even a worst-case scenario like this hurricane?</p><p>Anything that can make something like this better is a gadget I&apos;m willing to spend money on. Whether that&apos;s a water purifier, a camping stove, a portable fire pit, or something else you think would make life easier during hard times, I want to hear about it! Drop a comment below and let me know, and maybe together, we can help someone else out if they&apos;re stuck in a disaster, like I have been.</p><p>It&apos;s going to be an extremely long road to recovery here, but any semblance of normalcy at this time is something worth vying for.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I never seem to have enough USB ports at hand, so I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-revodok-max-213-thunderbolt-4-dock-review">UGREEN&apos;s Revodok Max 213</a> Thunderbolt 4 docking station with my machine, and recently got Elgato&apos;s USB Hub to connect to my Stream Deck+, providing two additional USB-C and two USB-A ports. Over the last two months, I used HiDock&apos;s H1 alongside the Revodok, and while the H1 has four USB ports, that isn&apos;t its best feature — far from it.</p><p>The H1 is a USB-C dock with a difference; it has a built-in speaker and mic that allows you to attend meetings, and the best part is that it leverages AI to automatically transcribe audio and provide summaries. The dock uses GPT-4o to transcribe, and HiDock touts background noise isolation, the ability to record phone calls, multiple speaker identification, and a whole lot more.</p><p>I use distinct tools to get most of these features, so the idea of all-in-one device is alluring. If you&apos;re interested in a dock with built-in audio and AI, this is what you need to know about the H1.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-hidock-h1-pricing-and-availability"><span>HiDock H1: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kcc6xgvKcjaUXsLSvmFeC3" name="hidock-h1-5.jpg" alt="HiDock H1 USB-C AI dock side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kcc6xgvKcjaUXsLSvmFeC3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>HiDock unveiled the H1 at the end of 2023, with general sale starting at the end of Q1 2024. The H1 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hidock.com/products/hidock-h1-audio-dock?variant=45517495107797">available for $269 on the brand&apos;s website</a>, and you can pick it up in Slate Gray or Platinum Gray color variants, with the latter costing an additional $20. There&apos;s also an H1E model that has limited ports, and it is retailing at $229.</p><p>To get the most out of the dock, you&apos;ll need to take a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hinotes.hidock.com/notes/payment">Pro plan of the brand&apos;s HiNotes service</a>. In that plan, 1200 minutes of audio transcribing and summarization will set you back $12.99, with 12000 minutes at $119.99. HiDock is now rolling out unlimited quotas as well, with the one-year plan at $199 and a three-year plan available for $599.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-hidock-h1-what-i-like"><span>HiDock H1: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k7MVgM8cnkUtVFi7qTGT74" name="hidock-h1-1.jpg" alt="HiDock H1 USB-C AI dock profile view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7MVgM8cnkUtVFi7qTGT74.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The H1 is larger than most docks, and that&apos;s because of the built-in speaker. The overall design is pretty good, and it has a distinct retro styling that I like. You get four chunky buttons with call controls, a knurled volume knob, and a slider that lets you adjust the level of background isolation.</p><p>The speaker is angled toward you, and the built-in mic picks up sound even at a distance. HiDock is known for its conference speakerphones, so it isn&apos;t surprising that the H1 does a good job in this regard. The sound quality out of the speaker is decent thanks to a 7W driver and 5W tweeter, and you can use it to listen to music in addition to meetings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eiNyzB9awLi7JygkWqX3pn" name="hidock-h1-8.jpg" alt="HiDock H1 USB-C AI dock back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eiNyzB9awLi7JygkWqX3pn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A unique addition is the detachable earpiece, and it attaches magnetically to the right side. The H1 is a USB-C dock, and you get a good selection of ports: there are dual HDMI ports, two USB-C ports, dual USB-A ports, SD/MicroSD card readers on the side, and 2.5GbE Ethernet connectivity.</p><p>The H1 takes up a lot of room on the desk, but it doesn&apos;t attract too much attention. The build quality is decent, and I didn&apos;t run into any issues in the two months I used the dock. You also get decent USB PD charging; any connected notebook can be easily charged at up to 100W, and the USB-C port on the side delivers 18W of charge. The side-mounted port is good enough to charge devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> and Samsung phones. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Mmb8CFaRJdDadbp8DKud5n" name="hidock-h1-3.jpg" alt="HiDock H1 USB-C AI dock volume knob" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mmb8CFaRJdDadbp8DKud5n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Clearly, the biggest talking point of the dock is the AI integration; HiDock touts the H1 with "lifetime free" AI transcription, and that&apos;s broadly true, but there are a few caveats. Buying the device automatically unlocks the Membership tier of HiNotes, the brand&apos;s notes service. The tier includes unlimited notes from mobile — albeit with a 10-minute limit on audio transcribing — along with AI summaries and the ability to export notes.</p><p>I mostly used the H1 with my gaming machine, and it did a decent job recording meetings and delivering summaries after the fact. HiNotes is available as a web app, and that&apos;s a good move as you don&apos;t have to download anything; all the configuration changes to the H1 and updates are handled via this client.</p><p>HiDock uses the GPT-4o language model to transcribe audio, and it was good enough in this area; it didn&apos;t pick up a lot of jargon that&apos;s used in briefings, but that&apos;s okay. The Pro tier unlocks speaker identification as well, and it is a great addition.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dZnwvL4HEHEijsHkWgA7c3" name="hidock-h1-11.jpg" alt="HiDock H1 USB-C AI dock side view with SD reader" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dZnwvL4HEHEijsHkWgA7c3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the premise of the H1 is great, the dock clearly has a lot of teething issues. The USB-C ports are advertised as being 10Gbps, but that wasn&apos;t the case when I plugged in storage drives to the dock — I got 5Gbps bandwidth instead.</p><p>A weird quirk is that it wasn&apos;t able to connect to my Windows machine via a USB-C to USB-C cable; I usually connect all accessories via USB-C, but the H1 necessitated a connection via the bundled USB-C to USB-A cable. It&apos;s a minor thing, but if you&apos;re seeing issues while setting up the device where the dock isn&apos;t showing up, you&apos;ll want to switch cables.</p><p>Another annoyance is the lack of Thunderbolt 4 connectivity; sure, it would have increased the cost of the H1, but it would have made the dock a much better option overall.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Kbsvn67cQUjpbTCZUJN6Co" name="hidock-h1-6.jpg" alt="HiDock H1 USB-C AI dock earbud" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kbsvn67cQUjpbTCZUJN6Co.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the audio quality out of the speaker is pretty good, the same cannot be said of the earpiece. It is tinny and the mic inside the earpiece isn&apos;t good, but the biggest issue is the fit; I just couldn&apos;t get a comfortable fit, and I didn&apos;t bother using it after a few tries.</p><p>The dock has built-in background isolation, but it isn&apos;t anywhere as effective as my preferred solution (NVIDIA Broadcast). If anything, Audeze&apos;s Filter does a better job in this area. Also, there were instances where pressing the recording button on the dock didn&apos;t trigger a recording, and I had to reconnect the dock to start over.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C82xHttxJZbSRpBHUeYDTn" name="hidock-h1-4.jpg" alt="HiDock H1 USB-C AI dock volume knob side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C82xHttxJZbSRpBHUeYDTn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the biggest limitation is the fact that you&apos;ll need to get the Pro plan to unlock the best features. The default Membership tier allows you to upload meetings of up to four hours and get AI-assisted transcribing and summaries, but if you want all the summary templates or need to export notes in Word and PDF formats, you&apos;ll need to shell out an additional amount.</p><p>Background noise isolation is similarly gated behind the Pro tier, as is speaker identification. These are useful features that ultimately make a tangible difference in how the H1 holds up, and having to pay an additional fee is annoying.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-hidock-h1-the-competition"><span>HiDock H1: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J2WXUq3AAvHnkQbfeqVjKM" name="ugreen-revodok-max-213-6.jpg" alt="UGREEN Revodok Max 213 Thunderbolt 4 dock review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J2WXUq3AAvHnkQbfeqVjKM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The H1 is unique in that it combines a USB-C dock with a conference speaker, and there isn&apos;t quite another product like it. If you just need a docking station, UGREEN&apos;s Revodok Max 213 is a great choice. It has Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, all the ports you need, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Revodok-Thunderbolt-Docking-Charging/dp/B0CM2X8ZNS">coming in at $299</a>, it isn&apos;t that much costlier than the H1 — albeit without any of the AI features.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-hidock-h1-should-you-buy-it"><span>HiDock H1: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EWg7c2hEJKVD6TPqzEZqbm" name="hidock-h1-2.jpg" alt="HiDock H1 USB-C AI dock front view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EWg7c2hEJKVD6TPqzEZqbm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an easy way to transcribe meetings</li><li>You want a USB dock with good design and decent port selection</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need Thunderbolt 4 connectivity</li><li>You don't intend to use the AI features</li></ul>
<p>To HiDock&apos;s credit, the brand got a lot right with the H1, but there are foibles that ultimately prevent the dock from being a great product. The H1 is primarily a dock, but it has issues with bandwidth, and I had to reconnect the dock several times in the two months I used it.</p><p>The AI features are great overall; the ability to transcribe audio and generate summaries of meetings is a novel addition. HiNotes is a good utility, but it is frustrating to use on mobile, and you will need to pick up the Pro plan to get the most out of the service.</p><p>There&apos;s clearly potential here, and if HiDock is able to iron out the kinks, a second-gen H1 would be easier to recommend.</p>

<p>Amazon has introduced three new Fire HD 8 tablets, all souped up with better performance and some slick generative AI capabilities.</p><p>Amazon’s new Fire HD 8 lineup includes the Fire HD 8 (2024), Fire HD 8 Kids, and Fire HD 8 Kids Pro, all loaded with handy generative AI features. You’ll find a writing assist feature built right into the keyboard to help you polish up your writing. Plus, the Amazon Silk browser can now whip up quick webpage summaries, and there&apos;s an AI tool that lets you create custom wallpapers just from a text prompt.</p><p>Starting later this month, Amazon’s AI features will also be available on various compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Fire tablets</a>, the company said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-fire-hd-8-tablets-gen-ai-hd-entertainment" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>True to its name, the new Fire HD 8 features an 8-inch display with a 1280 x 800 resolution. A standout upgrade in the 2024 model is the addition of 3GB of RAM in the base 32GB version, while the 64GB model gets a bump to 4GB of RAM.</p><p>While these specs aren’t revolutionary for a budget tablet, they’re a noticeable step up from the 2GB of RAM found in the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-8-2022-review">Fire HD 8</a> (2022 model), representing a 50 to 100 percent improvement.</p><p>The tablet also sports an improved rear camera, though it sticks to a modest 5MP resolution. Amazon claims it can last up to 13 hours on a single charge, which is the same as the previous model.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Fire HD 8 Kids and Fire HD 8 Kids Pro are designed for different age ranges—Kids is for little ones aged 3 to 7, while Pro is meant for kids 6 to 12. They both come with a two-year warranty that covers those inevitable mishaps. Plus, you’ll snag a 12-month subscription to Amazon Kids+ with your purchase.</p><p>Each of the three models comes in its own set of fun colors. The Fire HD 8 (2024) will be available in Black, Emerald, and Hibiscus. The Fire HD 8 Kids has options like Blue, Disney Pixar Cars (red and yellow), Disney Princess (pink and purple), and Grape. Lastly, the Fire HD 8 Kids Pro will feature colors like Discovery (teal and blue), Hello Teal, Jungle Cat (purple and blue), and Marvel Avengers (black and red).</p><p>Usually priced at $100 with lock-screen ads, the Fire HD 8 is now on sale for just $55 as part of the October Prime Day event. The Fire HD 8 Kids tablet, which typically costs $140, is also marked down to $70 for Prime Day.</p>

A lot of it is done in-house — Samsung designs its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy phones</a> and decides how everything is going to fit together then supplies a sort of framework for every piece, both hardware and software. Many of the pieces that make it actually work though, come from someone else and had to be licensed.</p><p>Using a product without the proper licensing agreements can lead to problems, something that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-another-patent-dispute-germany-report">OnePlus is learning about right now</a>.</p>
<p>Licensing and other assorted legal issues sound like some super boring part of making a phone. That may be so (I think it&apos;s really interesting), but even if that&apos;s true, it&apos;s still one of the most important parts. Without the proper licensing, both the hardware inside the phone and the software that powers it wouldn&apos;t exist.</p><p>Licensing refers to the permission to use a company&apos;s technology as a part of your product. It can be free, or it can be paid, and a court can even force it so one company doesn&apos;t get an unfair advantage. When done the right way, we never think about it and only really know it exists if we judiciously read through the terms and conditions flashed on the screen the first time we use something. When done the wrong way, it&apos;s news on every tech website because it could mean a product ban.</p><p>It&apos;s possibly the most important part of making a product.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1761px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.85%;"><img id="U3YNXfHjuU7LqSwpzCkPSF" name="qualcomm-5g-mmwave-momentum.png" alt="Qualcomm 5G mmWave Momentum" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U3YNXfHjuU7LqSwpzCkPSF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1761" height="737" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hardware inside your phone, tablet, earbuds, and everything else uses plenty of parts bought or licensed from elsewhere. It&apos;s something all companies do because it&apos;s something all companies need to do. A manufacturer that makes something as complicated as a phone usually isn&apos;t also in the business of designing, testing, authenticating, producing, and licensing network technology, for example. </p><p>Take Apple or Samsung; both companies build products that we can buy and those products have parts the company also builds inside of them. They also pay licensing fees to companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-x35-launch">Qualcomm</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/corning-interview">Corning</a> because they are using physical products developed by those companies. The same goes for Google. Just because you make a product and the chip inside of it doesn&apos;t mean you made everything.</p>
<p>Software works the same way, and this is one of the things you are probably pretty familiar with but don&apos;t know because you use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth earbuds</a>.</p><p>No matter if you use an iPhone or an Android phone, listening through a set of quality earbuds means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aptx-vs-aptx-hd-whats-difference">Qualcomm</a>, Sony, and other companies must be involved. There is no need for anyone to tell you about the software itself or to announce that it&apos;s using tech from another company, but without it, your Bluetooth would sound like it did 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Sony is also a great example of how licensing technology doesn&apos;t always mean money changes hands — it gives the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC audio codec</a> it developed away for free to Google so it can be included in every Android phone. The tech is still patented and belongs to Sony, it&apos;s just free to use. </p>
<p>And while OnePlus is once again in the thick of it with more licensing issues, we&apos;ve seen the same thing from Samsung, Motorola, and every other company, as well as from Apple and Google. Just because you&apos;re the "big dog" doesn&apos;t mean you get to use whatever you like without asking.</p><p>We&apos;ve even seen companies forced to license their tech by the courts in the interest of fairness. A company might charge exorbitant fees or refuse to license technology so it has some sort of advantage. Apple famously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2019/04/qualcomm-and-apple-agree-drop-all-litigation">refused to pay for tech from Qualcomm</a>, which it had used to force the issue in court because it felt that Qualcomm should have to play more fairly in this space.</p>

<p>None of this is a selling point for a product like a phone. In fact, companies usually don&apos;t mention much of it because they like to create the illusion that they&apos;ve done all the magic themselves. You might know your phone uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning Gorilla Glass</a> but had no idea it also uses firmware licensed from Broadcom. As long as it works and Broadcom gets paid, you didn&apos;t need to know and it only becomes important when things go wrong and a judge gets involved. </p><p>In a perfect world, ideas could be freely shared and all corporations worked together to make what&apos;s best for us all. In the real world, there&apos;s more than one way to be successful, and through licensing, we get the best tech that&apos;s out there in one product.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp now lets you pick filters like warm, cool, prism light, and fisheye with a new update.</li><li>Similarly, the update includes backgrounds like blur, office, and living room, amongst seven others.</li><li>These new filters and backgrounds will be rolling out to WhatsApp users in the coming weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like, in the coming weeks, your conventional WhatsApp video calls could be more engaging as the messaging platform is introducing new filters and backgrounds, WhatsApp announced.</p><p>According to the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-filters-and-backgrounds-for-video-calls">announcement post</a>, users will be able to apply filters and change backgrounds for video calls on WhatsApp, which may add a personal touch. The filters are believed to generate a playful atmosphere for users as they can add "a splash of color" or create a "more artistic feel" during video calls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ptueRMTeYCgAfbxGTuUfkg" name="whatsapp-filters.jpg" alt="WhatsApp new filters and backgrounds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ptueRMTeYCgAfbxGTuUfkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp/ Mark Zuckerberg)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Backgrounds, on the other hand, aim to keep users&apos; actual background space private and replace it with a cozy coffee shop or a cool-looking living room.</p><p>WhatsApp notes that it is adding ten new filters and ten different backgrounds for users to choose from. For filters, they can choose from "Warm, Cool, Black & White, Light leak, Dreamy, Prism light, Fisheye, Vintage TV, Frosted glass, and Duo tone. "</p>
<p>The background options comprise "Blur, Living room, Office, Cafe, Pebbles, Foodie, Smoosh, Beach, Sunset, Celebration and Forest." </p><p>Meta&apos;s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, shared some of these features on his WhatsApp platform. According to Zuckerberg&apos;s images, the interface should look a lot like what we are used to on Instagram and Snapchat filters and background options.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging service</a> users can find new Touch and Low light options to fine-tune their look during video calls. To apply these announced filters and backgrounds, users can see the effects icons at the "top right of the screen."</p><p>In other news from the recent Meta Connect, WhatsApp and other Meta-owned platforms have<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate"> gained new capabilities</a> in interacting with Meta AI.

Besides, they can share their photos with Meta AI and ask the assistant to make edits. </p>

<ul><li>A discovery in the latest Google Messages beta shows the company could bring full RCS support to Wear OS devices.</li><li>Such support would let LTE and Wi-Fi smartwatches send RCS texts without relying on the connection between it and your phone.</li><li>Wear OS 5 recently started arriving for the two past-gen Pixel watches, but was cut off due to a crippling issue.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google might look to give its Wear OS software a much-needed upgrade for its messaging experience.</p><p>A look into the recent Google Messages beta (v20240926), lines of code suggests Wear OS could pick up full RCS messaging support. The discovery was made by known X tipster AssembleDebug in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wear-os-standalone-rcs-messages-apk-teardown-3486475/">Android Authority</a>. Several newly added strings of code in the beta beginning with "bugle.enable_wear" mention new "standalone" support.</p><p>The post states this "standalone" addition regards RCS, RCS settings, and voice messaging.</p><p>Unfortunately, the initial discovery is extremely light on sufficient information. The tipster couldn&apos;t uncover the look of the RCS settings on Wear OS nor could they test this support. Google is likely still deep in development for tying Wear OS-ready watches to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a> servers through the Messages app.</p><p>Speaking of the RCS servers, this is exactly the issue, as noted by the publication. Wear OS devices "can" send RCS texts, but this relies on its connection with your phone — even LTE models. However, if Google proceeds with its development of proper RCS on smartwatches, users could send and receive such texts without relying on their phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aFo87rpy8zfzMobPVrbe3U" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-with-pixel-buds-pro-2-3.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 with Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aFo87rpy8zfzMobPVrbe3U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s also unclear is how soon Wear OS users expect this RCS update. Wear OS 5 arrived on the Pixel Watch 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-5-september-2024-update">recently started rolling out</a> on the two past-gen devices in the series. The update includes bug fixes and a few new updates for Pixel Recorder functionality, a new grid-view app launcher, and upgraded camera controls. However, the update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">was shut down due to crippling issues</a> plaguing some users.</p><p>Concerning RCS, we may have to look forward to a future Android drop including something for Wear OS users to sift through.</p><p>RCS is a messaging standard Google has been pushing and incorporating across devices for a while now. The company has even urged its competitor, Apple, to do the same while citing the positives RCS brings. The standard keeps media quality high, ensures our group chats remain stable, and noteworthy E2EE (end-to-end encryption) to our conversations.</p><p>Apple also finally gave in and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">brought RCS support to the iPhone</a> via its iOS 18 update in September. While the patch brought its functionality, iPhone users communicating with Android still lack a crucial aspect: E2EE.</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 comes in and makes good on what users felt Google could've gotten better with the Pixel Watch 2. Google upgraded this watch with a better battery that should take you a little more than a day. More importantly, Wear OS 5 packs loads of new features and a refreshed experience that (hopefully) continues.</p></p>

<p>Scheduled for release on October 15th, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Quest 3S</a> is Meta's attempt at releasing an affordable VR headset that doesn't skimp on premium features. Aside from new lenses and a slight drop in graphical quality, the Quest 3S boasts all of the same processing power and performance found in the more-expensive Quest 3.

<p>One of our favorite <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Meta Quest 3 accessories</a>, the ZyberVR head strap is a great replacement if you don't like using Meta's included strap. It's comfortable enough for extended gaming sessions, plus you get a ton of adjustability and a durable construction. Unfortunately, the strap doesn't come with a battery pack, but the current 46% discount at Amazon makes the accessory an absolute steal. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHPDYLW1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c840d1ba-86f7-40c2-8925-fb42ed43af6a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ZyberVR Meta Quest 3 Head Strap: $45.99" data-dimension48="ZyberVR Meta Quest 3 Head Strap: $45.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-is-the-next-prime-day-2">When is the next Prime Day?</h2>
<p>The next Prime Day sale event — officially known as Big Deal Days — is set to kick off on October 8th and run through October 9th. Just like the July sale, you can expect hundreds of great deals on everything from tech to furniture and appliances, with the majority of discounts being exclusive to Prime members. </p>
<h2 id="what-meta-quest-deals-can-i-expect-during-big-deal-days-2">What Meta Quest deals can I expect during Big Deal Days?</h2>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S is still in its preorder period, and there was recently a significant price drop on the Quest 3, so it&apos;s hard to know if Amazon will discount the devices further once the sale goes live. Meta tends to do its own thing during Prime Day, but at the very least, you can expect many of the best Meta Quest accessories to receive major discounts during the sale. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-big-deal-days-2">Do I need to be a Prime member to shop during Big Deal Days?</h2>
<p>Yes, the majority of discounts featured during Big Deal Days will be exclusive to Prime members. If you haven&apos;t joined yet, the good news is that Amazon offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>30-day free trial</strong></a> so you can explore all of the benefits of a Prime membership for a month without paying a dime. After the trial period, you&apos;ll be billed $14.99 per month, so be sure to cancel before the trial is over if you don&apos;t want to pay. </p>

<ul><li>Epic Games, the creators of Fortnite, seeks another lawsuit against Google — and now Samsung — for anti-competitive practices against third-party downloads.</li><li>This new suit concerns Samsung's "Auto Blocker" feature, which is reportedly "designed to prevent competition," per Epic's CEO Tim Sweeney.</li><li>Epic delivered a draft of its 42-page suit to Samsung.</li><li>A jury sided with Epic in its initial lawsuit against Google in December 2023 concerning anti-competitive Play Store practices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Epic Games is taking its crusade for third-party app stores to Google (again) and Samsung.</p><p>The latest lawsuit reportedly concerns Samsung&apos;s "Auto Blocker" feature on devices running One UI 6 and up. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker">The Verge</a>, the feature is turned on by default on Galaxy devices, preventing users from downloading/installing "unauthorized" apps. This extends to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">third-party app stores</a>, too, to which Epic states there is "no process" for an outside party to "authorize" itself.</p><p>Epic&apos;s CEO Tim Sweeney states, "the thing’s not designed to protect against malware, which would be a completely legitimate purpose. The thing’s designed to prevent competition."</p><p>The Verge contacted Samsung for confirmation about Auto Blocker&apos;s functions, which it neither confirmed nor denied. However, Samsung spokesperson Chris Langlois stated, "contrary to Epic Game’s assertions, Samsung actively fosters market competition, enhances consumer choice, and conducts its operations fairly."</p><p>The gaming company reportedly approached Samsung to create a "whitelisting" process for Auto Blocker. This would&apos;ve relieved the strenuous "21-step process" awaiting users looking to get around the automatic safety feature. Talks fell by the wayside and now Epic has delivered a draft of its 42-page lawsuit against Samsung <em>and </em>Google.</p><p>The latter is wrapped in this because of its alleged antitrust practices against third-party stores similar to Samsung. What&apos;s more, Epic purports that Samsung colluded with Google to create its Auto Blocker feature — but there&apos;s no proof.</p><p>Regardless, Google has denied such allegations. Its head of security for Android, Dave Kleidermacher stated, "Google did not request that Samsung create their Auto Blocker feature."</p><p>The publication reports that Epic is seeking a jury trial once again. Additionally, Sweeney states this fight, like its initial battle with Google, is for "all developers, not just Epic."</p>

<p>Epic&apos;s fight against Samsung regarding its anti-competitive "Auto Blocker" isn&apos;t new as the company&apos;s CEO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-is-protesting-samsungs-anticompetitive-practices-but-users-are-the-ones-losing">voiced his displeasure</a> over the summer. Sweeney played a similar tune to its earlier fight with Google stating in a tweet, "this change obstructs users from installing competing stores..."</p><p>Epic was able to parade around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">a victory against Google</a> in its antitrust case about the Play Store in December 2023. A jury unanimously agreed that Google&apos;s Play Store operated as a monopoly and employed antitrust practices against other developers. The start of that battle was the result of Epic adding its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-considered-acquiring-epic-games-due-fortnite-storefront-controversy">own payment system</a>, namely for purchasing V-Bucks for Fortnite.</p><p>During the hearing, it was stated that the Play Store was responsible for "95% of Android downloads." Seen as "dominance," Epic stated Google played rough with developers and smartphone makers who may have challenged them. The latter denied such theories, stating its stronghold benefits users.</p><p>As The Verge also noted today (Oct 2), this victory verdict for Epic in 2023 didn&apos;t involve "Unknown Sources" or third-party apps/stores. With this newfound lawsuit narrowing its scope for both Google and Samsung, Epic might find itself back in the courtroom.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android developers can now experiment with Gemini Nano through the AI Edge SDK on the Pixel 9 series.</li><li>Currently, developers can only use text-to-text prompts, paving the way for features like rephrasing, smart replies, proofreading, and summarization.</li><li>This experimental access is for development only, not production use.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is making Gemini Nano more accessible, a game-changing AI model built to run directly on devices, cutting out the need for an internet connection.</p><p>Before this expansion, Gemini Nano was only available for Google’s own apps. Originally launched on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> in December 2023, it later became available on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series.</p><p>However, this exclusivity didn’t last long, as Google has recently extended access to Xiaomi devices, signaling a major step towards wider adoption.</p><p>Alongside its own apps, Google granted a select group of external partners early access to the on-device AI model, though their contributions are yet to be revealed.</p><p>Google has now made a significant move toward the broader adoption of Gemini Nano by allowing Android developers to experiment with the model through the AI Edge SDK via AICore on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series, as detailed in a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-nano-experimental-access-available-on-android.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>Currently, Google is allowing developers to experiment exclusively with text-to-text prompts. This opens up opportunities for exploring applications like rephrasing, smart replies, proofreading, and summarization within the Gemini Nano framework.</p><p>Future updates for Gemini Nano are expected to introduce support for various modalities, including images, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">expand compatibility to a broader range of devices</a>. Mishaal Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/what-phones-support-gemini-nano/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, has pointed out potential candidates for this compatibility, including the Xiaomi 14T, devices from Motorola and Realme, as existing Nano-compatible devices from Samsung.</p><p>Although this experimental access allows developers to explore Gemini Nano, it’s important to note that it is strictly for development purposes and not meant for production environments. Developers can access Android AICore (Beta) by joining the AICore system through the Play Store.</p><p>This broader compatibility will enable developers to integrate Nano into their third-party apps, giving them a major AI boost. This could lead to a whole new wave of AI-powered apps hitting the Play Store.</p>

<hr>
<p>Disney has been priming users worldwide for a password-sharing crackdown on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a> streaming service, and that is now officially underway. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/paid-sharing-disney-explainer/" target="_blank">blog post</a> last week, the company outlined its plans to entice account sharers to pay their own way for the service. Part of that effort includes making it clear that, like Netflix, Disney Plus is only intended to work within one household.</p><p>"Your Disney+ subscription is meant to be used within your Household, which is a collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside there," Disney says in the post. </p><p>People outside your household "will need to sign up and pay for their own subscription or be added as an Extra Member to your account for an additional monthly fee to continue enjoying Disney+." </p><p>Many of the policies Disney is now rolling out were piloted in select markets around the world this summer. They&apos;re intended to increase Disney&apos;s streaming revenue, either by forcing password sharers into buying their own plan or pushing account owners to add a paid extra member. Disney&apos;s streaming arm lost money for years, but was profitable for the first time during Q3 2024, when an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2024/08/q3-fy24-earnings.pdf" target="_blank">earnings report</a> revealed that the company generated $47 million in revenue across Disney Plus, Hulu, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-watch-espn-plus-tv-phone-roku-online">ESPN Plus</a>. </p><p>Disney looks to keep that momentum going with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-paid-sharing-enforced-us-launch">the new Extra Member plans</a>, which are available for the Disney Plus Basic and Premium tiers. Subscribers can add a person outside of their household to their plan for an extra $6.99 for Basic plans or $9.99 for Premium plans. At the moment, you can only add one extra member to a plan, and extra members aren&apos;t supported for the bundle that includes Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus. </p><p>The options are widely rolling out for subscribers in the U.S., Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. If users don&apos;t want to add an extra member, they can port a user profile to a new Disney Plus account, as long as it&apos;s not a minor account or a Junior mode account. </p><p>Luckily, there are options for when you&apos;re traveling or relocating. If you get a warning that Disney Plus detects you&apos;re away from your household, you can tap "I&apos;m away from home" or "Update household" to keep watching. This will send a one-time password to the account owner&apos;s email for verification. It&apos;s unclear if any long-term restrictions will be put in place to prevent password sharing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>, like Netflix&apos;s requirements, which make you connect to a home Wi-Fi network every month. </p>

<p>Disney and Netflix&apos;s actions in the password-sharing crackdown represent a departure from how the services industry has typically treated family plans. Most subscription services, like Apple iCloud Plus or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one" target="_blank">Google One Premium</a>, give you a set number of accounts you can share purchases or benefits with. Steam Families, which lets you share games and media purchased on Steam, works the same way. </p><p>Apple, Google, and Valve let you share content with a set number of accounts, no matter where they&apos;re located. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming services</a> are throwing this conventional notion of family sharing out the window. Disney and Netflix call their plans for the "household," but they&apos;re really for the property or residence. Families and households take a variety of forms, and members aren&apos;t always living in the same location.</p><p>Netflix and Disney don&apos;t care about that. In fact, they would prefer if multiple family members had to pay for their services. They&apos;ve neared the peak of their revenue streams and want more. If most families already have a Netflix or Disney Plus subscription, how do these companies continue to grow? The answer is: try to break those families up. </p><p>Take me, for example. I live in Arizona, and the rest of my family lives on the U.S. east coast. Most of my family lives together most of the time, but some of my siblings are in college. I was in school not too long ago. It seems crazy for myself (especially when I was still a full-time student), my siblings, and my parents to all have separate subscriptions. This is just my immediate family I&apos;m talking about. </p><p>But that&apos;s exactly what Disney and Netflix want. As a consumer, my first response to these policies is simple: who are Disney and Netflix to tell me where and how I can use the subscription I&apos;m paying for? Especially when prices continue to go up year after year.</p><p>It&apos;s pushing me, and many others, to ditch streamers altogether. I&apos;m only subscribed to one streaming service, Paramount Plus. I love it, but I&apos;ve been completely disenfranchised by the others. In a way, Disney and Netflix&apos;s crackdowns have worked; I don&apos;t share accounts for their services anymore, but now I don&apos;t use them at all.  </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="fikXNA3gkgeZeuyAz359XW" name="netflix-spotify-curb-piracy-hero.jpg" alt="Netflix TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fikXNA3gkgeZeuyAz359XW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The elephant in the room here is piracy. Yes, piracy is illegal, and you really shouldn&apos;t do it. But piracy was rampant in the 1990s and early 2000s before digital music stores like iTunes started popping up. Sites like Napster were ubiquitous for sharing pirated content. The piracy seemed to stop when it was easy to buy media, either through individual online purchases or all-encompassing subscriptions. </p><p>When it&apos;s easy to pay for media legally, consumers have proven over decades that they&apos;ll certainly do it. However, the market has also learned the hard way that users will absolutely pirate content when companies and studios make it difficult to obtain licenses and stream content lawfully. </p><p>As we enter the late stage of the streaming wars, where account sharing is null, digital rights battles remove content from services on a monthly basis, and price hikes happen on a yearly basis, I&apos;m worried the media industry could be making things difficult enough that consumers resort to other ways of obtaining content. </p>
