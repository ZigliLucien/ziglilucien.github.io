This digital technology offers a ton of convenience and versatility when switching phones, making eSIM-compatible devices perfect for regular travelers. </p><p>Rather than putting your entire user identity into a tiny physical chip, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/difference-between-sim-and-esim-and-what-future-holds">eSIMs</a> (or Embedded Subscriber Identity Modules) digitally preserve all of this information so you don't need to worry about it. This means that you can swap your eSIM to different phones or easily change <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">wireless carriers</a> when you're travelling internationally, plus there's an inherent security benefit when you don't have a physical card that could be tampered with or stolen. Some Android phones even let you have multiple eSIM cards active at the same time. </p><p>Of course, not every Android phone is eSIM-compatible, and the ones that are can cost a pretty penny. But fear not — I've gathered all of the best eSIM-compatible phones below, with options for every need and budget under the sun. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-at-a-glance"><span>At a glance</span></h3>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="6bcb2b5f-0c2e-4331-a6cf-dd3fb6801ba9">            <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-esim-compatible-android-phones#section-best-overall" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy S25"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAJ2amipBfc3ahcYNfPVtb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 in Navy"><span class='featured__label hero__label'>Best overall</span></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">1.

And thanks to its compact 6.2-inch frame, it's also one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small phones</a> on the market today, making it a perfect pick for travelers and homebodies alike. </p><p>The phone is much lighter, slimmer, and easier to hold than the Galaxy S24, while the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 construction ensures you can count on the phone's durability no matter where you are in the world. The flagship phone is also driven by the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePlus 13, plus you get stellar AI-boosted software features, 12GB of RAM, and seven years of OS/security upgrades straight out of the box. The Galaxy S25 also boasts eSIM and dual-SIM support in both the United States and internationally, making it a versatile device for traveling overseas. </p><p>Again, the Galaxy S25 is unfortunately not a major upgrade over its predecessor, especially when you're looking at the cameras and battery life. That's not to say that these specs are <em>bad</em>, but they feel a bit underwhelming when you consider today's competitive Android landscape.

The vibrant 6.3-inch display is only slightly larger than the Galaxy S25, while the 2,700 nits of peak brightness and 120Hz refresh rate makes the screen an absolute pleasure to use (assuming you don't suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">PWM sensitivity</a>).

In all of our testing, we found that the midrange phone could easily last two full days with casual use, while heavy gaming, streaming, and AI use gave us a full day of battery life before the Pixel 9a needed another charge. </p><p>The problem is that once the phone <em>does</em> need juice, the 23W charging speeds are a bit slower than we'd like. Nevertheless, when you pair the Pixel 9a's flagship-level specs with the accessible price tag and yes, eSIM support, you get an affordable device that's worth a closer look. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">3.

Sure, Motorola has been producing excellent foldable phones for years, but a new addition to the Razr lineup that costs over $1,000? Sounds more like a Samsung move to me, and not in a good way. </p><p>Fortunately, my concerns were swiftly allayed, as the Razr Ultra might literally be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">best flip phone</a> ever made. With this new release, Motorola has taken everything it's learned making Razr phones over the past few years and packed it into a super-premium, super-powered device. The Ultra comes equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 16GB of RAM for powerful performance, plus you'll enjoy an all-day battery with fast 68W charging. Both the inner and outer pOLED displays on the Razr Ultra (2025) are vibrant and functional, and the upgraded titanium hinge feels sturdy enough to last for years. </p><p>True, the Ultra's price tag is still a bit of a problem, and some may wonder if Motorola really <em>needed</em> to make a premium flip phone when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr Plus</a> already checked a lot of the same boxes.

After all, it's one of the few phones to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">a coveted 5/5-star rating</a> here at Android Central, and looking at the specs, it isn't hard to see why. </p><p>The OnePlus 13 is powered by the top-rated Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, plus you get an eye-friendly 6.8-inch OLED screen with a Display Mate A++ rating and IP69 durability straight out of the box. Senior editor Nick Sutrich even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl5QVUadfbs">stuck the phone into a dishwasher</a> to verify its water resistance. The cameras are just as good as the latest devices from Samsung and Google, and the phone's battery will easily last a full day on a single charge, whether you're gaming, streaming content, or surfing the web. The phone also has support for two Nano SIM cards <em>and </em>eSIM, which is awesome when you have an unlocked phone and travel frequently. </p><p>If I had to be nitpicky, I'd say the OnePlus 13's biggest faults lie in the limited AI features and six years of software support (Samsung and Google are both guaranteeing seven years these days). And if you're based in North America, you may have trouble accessing the phone's full potential through your wireless carrier, <em>especially </em>if you use an MVNO. OnePlus 13 deals are also pretty uncommon, which means you might need to buy the phone unlocked at full price if you're shopping outside of a major sale event. </p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><p>Given the ubiquity of eSIM compatibility in recent smartphones, it's no wonder that this list looks a lot like our regular guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> of 2025. Indeed, picking the best eSIM-compatible phone is basically the same as choosing a great Android device for any use case, but there are a few details to consider before you make your purchase.</p><p><strong>Carrier restriction: </strong>If you buy a phone that's locked to a specific wireless carrier, you'll only be able to use that carrier's network when traveling, thereby removing a lot of the convenience and flexibility of an eSIM. In other words, if you found a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra deal</a> through your wireless carrier, double check the company's locked device policy. Verizon, for instance, won't let you unlock your phone until 60 days after its purchase, making things tricky if you have a big trip coming up. </p><p><strong>Dual-SIM: </strong>Some of the best eSIM-compatible phones also support dual-SIM, which means you're getting the convenience of both a virtual eSIM and <em>at least</em> one physical SIM card slot. The problem is that many manufacturers aren't clear about their device's dual-SIM compatibility. Some devices that support dual-SIM in Europe, like the Motorola Razr Ultra, for instance, lack the feature in the US market. If you'd like a phone with dual-SIM support, check the product listings closely and do a bit of research before you commit. </p><p><strong>Other considerations: </strong>Of course, every traveler has their own priorities when shopping for a new phone. When it's your turn to make the purchase, consider what kind of user you are before settling on a product. </p><p>For example, do you need a phone that's rugged enough to take on the trail? The OnePlus 13 might be the best pick for you. Do you need all of the latest camera features to expertly document your travels? Then perhaps the AI-boosted Pixel 9 Pro is the right choice. Needless to say, if you're looking for a great phone with eSIM-compatibility, you can't go wrong with any of the options listed above, it might just take a little extra research to find your dream device. </p> ]]></dc:content>

The former ran a survey, seeking to identify the changes in online habits by users when it comes to scams and other malicious attempts. According to the research, "over 60% of US consumers perceive an increase in scams over the past year, with one third personally experiencing a data breach."</p><p>While this number seems high (and is undoubtedly is), Google says the data points toward positivity. It states that while users are seeing more scams online, they've felt more "confident in their ability to spot" and avoid them. The other side of this is 61% of users in the survey stated the majority of these scams appeared via email.</p><p>Witnessing and spotting scams at such a high number makes senses when you factor in Google's other discovery: "Half of Americans — and over 60% of Gen Z — spend at least 5 hours on their phones per day."</p><p>However, the way we manage ourselves online, such as keeping our accounts safe, isn't the same. Google and Morning Consult find that our perception of a "safe account" differs between the generations. For Gen X and Baby Boomers, they all prefer concrete passwords that you either have to remember or write down. Google states "over 60%" of people in these generations use passwords, leaving the other 30% to rely on social sign-ins.</p><p>The complete opposite is Gen Z, which reportedly leverages new sign-in methods like passkeys or social sign-ins — Millennials, too.</p><h2 id="spot-malice-cut-it-2">Spot Malice & Cut It</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:646px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.88%;"><img id="ooXk6xNch6sFiTpf7w69dC" name="google-pixel-march-feature-drop-suspicious-texts" alt="Google is rolling out scam detection measures for texts and calls on the Pixel 9 and 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ooXk6xNch6sFiTpf7w69dC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="646" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While there is still a vast majority of Americans who prefer using passwords, Google highlights a few protections to utilize. Tools like the Google Password Manager, 2FA (two-factor authentication), and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-authenticator-security-material-you-redesign">Google Authenticator App</a> give those written credentials more power against attackers.</p><p>Although, we shouldn't forget that Google has been walking this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-brings-passkeys-to-android-and-chrome">path of a passwordless future</a> for a while. As such, the company draws awareness to other sign-in options, like passkeys. Moreover, the company states opting to create accounts with "Sign in with Google" is another viable choice. The post states choosing this option will give you the security of your Google Account wherever you're going — plus, you won't have to memorize <em>another </em>password!</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Google has been stepping up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">scam/fraud detection capabilities</a> in recent time. In its March feature drop, the company introduced a treasure trove of scam detection features for phone calls and texts in Google Messages. If something in the call or text triggers the software, users will be promptly alerted and told to avoid further contact.</p><p>Google brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-android-scam-spam-notification-gemini-protection">similar advancements to Chrome</a> on Android, too, thanks to Gemini. The browser's Safety Check stepped its game up, keeping an eye on malicious notifications and more.</p><p>In May, Google published its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fraud-advisory-update-informs-users-threats">latest fraud advisory findings</a> to keep uses on their toes when online.

The retain the CMF sub-brand's design flair, and deliver the same great build quality along with sound signature — and yes, the orange color is intact. The Buds 2 are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Headphones-Cancellation-Integration/dp/B0DXPBRK9N">available for $49 on Amazon U.S.</a>, and they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/CMF-Nothing-Wireless-Earbuds-Resistance/dp/B0DZ81TM6Y">cost £34 on Amazon U.K.</a>, which is a decent deal when you look at everything you get.

Nothing is being aggressive in India, where the Buds 2 retail for just ₹2,699 ($31) and the Buds 2 Plus coming in at ₹3,299 ($38). The brand notes that sales will begin at the end of June, and like their predecessors, they will likely sell really well considering the sheer value — particularly with the Buds 2 Plus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5035px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4H5Jk6vyjsMG7EuKYHqwZV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4H5Jk6vyjsMG7EuKYHqwZV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5035" height="2836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus have a similar design aesthetic, and they retain the distinctive cases that contains a dial.

The bass in particular has good vibrancy, and it delivers a tight rumble that makes listening to most modern music highly enjoyable. The mids are clean, and you get a decent treble without any harshness. There's an equalizer that allows you to change the balance between the frequencies, and an Ultra Bass mode that cranks up the low-end energy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="G3mkfwqoqArriNpkzugCgV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3mkfwqoqArriNpkzugCgV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, the Buds 2 are the best-sounding budget earbuds, and Nothing deserves credit for not omitting features on the buds. They don't get AptX codecs or LDAC, but you get really good noise isolation, and it did an effective job tuning out the chatter of my mechanical keyboard (a Lemokey L5 HE) and the air con. The buds managed to last just over six hours, and that's quite good; there's also a fast charging mode that delivers over two hours of music playback with just a 10-minute charge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5040px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cu6voF8MWULwuTxyuP5XhV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cu6voF8MWULwuTxyuP5XhV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5040" height="2839" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the Buds 2 Plus, they last just as long as the regular model, and the key addition is LDAC codec integration. Considering LDAC has been baked into Android for over half a decade now, you'll get higher bitrates if you're using a lossless source. The Buds 2 Plus have a slightly bigger 12mm driver that has a bit more grunt in the low-end, and they're just as clean with the mids and treble as the regular model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4812px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="vCSPnGD3tYjfJG5ZnTxAVV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCSPnGD3tYjfJG5ZnTxAVV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4812" height="2710" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What I like the most is that the Buds 2 Plus have a custom sound profile that adjusts the audio based on your hearing; you take a test wherein you select what range of frequencies you're able to hear, and it tailors the sound accordingly.

The Chinese manufacturer rolled out one hit after another; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a> was fabulous, and then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> came along, beating every other phone at taking photos and videos. Vivo built on that momentum with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>, which is easily one of my favorite devices of 2025.</p><p>And now there's the X200 Ultra, which has a new design and even better cameras than its predecessor. Annoyingly, the phone isn't launching outside China; Vivo continues to limit its best phones to its home market, and it's having a hard enough time ensuring the device is in stock in the country.</p><p>So if you want your hands on the X200 Ultra, you'll need to go the reseller route. While I don't usually advocate it, the X200 Ultra is an outlier — it is no less than the best phone I used in 2025, and it easily outscores every other rivals in meaningful areas. I wasn't sure how Vivo could improve upon the X100 Ultra, but the X200 Ultra proves that it is possible.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Pricing and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7pzcNX3AD8rurDfsFuHzMS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra back view highlighted against grey background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7pzcNX3AD8rurDfsFuHzMS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo unveiled the X200 Ultra on April 21, and the phone is now available in China. The base model has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and it costs 6,499 RMB ($902) in the country. The 16GB/512GB model costs 6,999 RMB ($971), and there's a 16GB/1TB model that's 7,999 RMB ($1,112).</p><p>The device continues to be sold out in most variants, and as of writing, only the 16GB/512GB edition is available. Just like Xiaomi, Vivo is rolling out a custom edition that includes a Photography Kit, and this has the 16GB/1TB variant of the phone along with a dedicated hardware lens, case, camera attachment, and other extras. This is the variant I'm using, and it costs 9,699 ($1,346) in China.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.82-inch LTPO3 AMOLED, 120Hz, 3168x1440, Dolby Vision, 4500 nits max, Armor Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OriginOS 5 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, Adreno 830, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.28-inch Sony Lytia LYT-818, 35mm, 4K120 video, gimbal OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.28-inch Sony Lytia LYT-818, 14mm wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>200MP Samsung HP9 telephoto, 85mm, 3.7x optical zoom, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.5 with autofocus, 4K60 video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 global 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS, satellite connectivity (1TB model)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, 24-bit/192kHz, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6,000mAh silicon battery, 90W charging, 40W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.1 x 76.8 x 8.7mm, 229g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>White, Red, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-design"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5174px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="hMVLVxwChWMiw8kuNkChYS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra next to X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hMVLVxwChWMiw8kuNkChYS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5174" height="2914" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Brands don't really change their designs all that much these days, and that's true of the X200 Ultra as well. The phone is a massive slab, and coming in at 229g — the same as last year — it is one of the heaviest around. To be fair, all of the Ultra models this year are on the heavier side as they switched to 6,000mAh batteries (outside of the S25 Ultra, obviously), and to its credit, Vivo did a good job with the weight balance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vLBU7aJWCcbzZJZAGhYiGS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra next to X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vLBU7aJWCcbzZJZAGhYiGS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The back of the X200 Ultra is dominated by a gargantuan camera island; the phone houses four camera modules at the back, and given the size of each unit and the resolution you're getting, it's no wonder that the housing takes over a third of the back.

The other key design change is the switch to flat sides; the X100 Ultra had a flowing design, but Vivo is emulating prevailing trends in phone design and switched to a flat profile.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kj7b3cc9S2tCqQin5hNaFS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kj7b3cc9S2tCqQin5hNaFS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, you get considerable bevels on the sides, so it isn't uncomfortable in the least to hold and use the device.

What's interesting is that there's a second Lytia LYT-818 sensor that handles wide-angle duties, and you get a 200MP Samsung ISOCELL HP9 tele lens with 3.7x optical zoom. Vivo isn't using a fourth sensor like the Find X8 Ultra, and honestly, the 200MP module is easily the best of any telephoto options available today.</p><p>The X200 Ultra has just about everything you can imagine; it does 4K120 video with the main lenses, and 4K60 as standard with all rear cameras as well as the front 50MP module, and it includes Dolby Vision at 4K60 as well. Video stabilization is decent out of the box, and there's an ultra stabilization mode that basically gives you clean footage while shooting handheld on the move.</p><p>You get a good range of shooting modes, and there's portrait video this time, giving you the ability to shoot video with a consistent background blur. The camera viewfinder has all the modes easily accessible, and you get Zeiss effects that alter the look of photos. I used the Vivid profile most of the time as it provides a vibrancy to the photos with high contrast, but there are a half-dozen effects available.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

camera shoots at a 35mm focal length now, with the wide-angle lens at 14mm, and the telephoto hitting 85mm. The phone has the best wide-angle lens of any device I used, and Vivo deserves credit for using the same module as the main camera — it makes a noticeable difference. Predictably, the wide-angle lens takes photos of the same caliber as the main camera, and that's just great to see.</p><p>The 50MP main lens is the best around, and it overshadows anything that Google, Samsung, and Xiaomi have to offer. I'll do a dedicated camera review of the device with the external lens, but the gist of it is that the main camera has better dynamic range and color vibrancy than the 1-inch main sensor on the X100 Ultra, and that is an achievement in and of itself. It delivers incredible shots in challenging situations, and even with little to no visible light, it produced images with plenty of detail and clarity.</p><p>What I like the most about the phone is its portrait shots; Vivo has proven over the last year that it knows how to deliver stunning portrait photos, and the X200 Ultra continues this trend. The phone takes shots with excellent detail and faultless background segmentation, and this is a key reason why I continue to prefer Vivo's phones over OPPO and Xiaomi.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5169px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="ACePS75iSGBd7gPceXmbkS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra with external lens and all the accessories" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ACePS75iSGBd7gPceXmbkS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5169" height="2912" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a similar vein, the 200MP telephoto is nothing short of extraordinary. The HP9 module is the best available today, and Vivo once again put it to great use, delivering crystal-clear shots at 3.7x and beyond. I was able to get usable shots at up to 30x, and it remains the best tele lens of any flagship you can buy today. Like last year, it doubles as a macro shooter, and you get decent detail in this mode.</p><p>Overall, the X200 Ultra is the best camera I used yet; it does a better job than last year's X100 Ultra, and there isn't any other phone that's able to measure up to it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-software"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Software</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="eyhTJLDixfHbt8QpuQ3WcS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra Android 15 Easter egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eyhTJLDixfHbt8QpuQ3WcS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to other Vivo phones in China, you get OriginOS 5 instead of Funtouch OS 15 that is standard on global models. I like what Vivo is doing with OriginOS; the interface is fluid, and you get extensive customizability with exclusive features that aren't available in the global build.</p><p>Using a phone with a China-focused build isn't anywhere as limiting as it used to be just a few years ago; you can easily install the Play Store from Vivo's app store, and once that's done, you can sign in to your Google account (you'll need to go into settings to enable basic Google services), and then set up the phone as you would any other device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rbj8mgzF3wAy3dcpaT3yiS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra notification shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rbj8mgzF3wAy3dcpaT3yiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I didn't see any issues with Google Pay or my usual banking utilities, and for the most part, it was just as seamless as using the global X200 Pro. However, there are two limitations: push notifications from WhatsApp and Gmail continue to be hit-and-miss, and in the case of WhatsApp, that included calls. Even if you disable battery optimization (which is enabled as standard), it doesn't make much of a difference.</p><p>I wasn't able to set up the Pixel Watch 3 with the phone — it just wouldn't connect to the smartwatch, and the app crashed constantly. So if you need to use a Wear OS smartwatch, know that you can't pair it with the device. Outside of these issues, there are no problems with using the X200 Ultra as a daily driver.</p><p>When it comes to updates, the X200 Ultra will receive four Android OS updates alongside six years of security updates, and while that is on the lower end of the scale, it is what Vivo guarantees on all of its devices. I would have liked to see at least five years of updates, but that isn't the case.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-the-alternatives"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: The alternatives</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h2SeJ4hRpM2dXCPSnjMv6F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2SeJ4hRpM2dXCPSnjMv6F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Chinese manufacturers are doing a good job with their Ultra models, and the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has better cameras than last year and a design that's easier to hold and use. While it doesn't quite measure up to the X200 Ultra — I still prefer Vivo's camera tuning and auxiliary lenses — the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is sold globally, and doesn't cost as much as the X200 Ultra, making it a decent alternative.</p><p>The Find X8 Ultra is the closest rival to the X200 Ultra, delivering a similar caliber of cameras and all the other extras. Like the X200 Ultra, the Find X8 Ultra is limited to China and isn't launching in other regions, so it is just as difficult to get a hold of if you're outside the country. Out of the two, I'd get the X200 Ultra; Vivo's software continues to be better, and the design is cleaner.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5139px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xfxdMXcoahvQKV9qTtFodS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra back view against a grey background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xfxdMXcoahvQKV9qTtFodS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5139" height="2895" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need the best cameras</li><li>You want a phone with versatile lenses</li><li>You want a bright AMOLED with useful customizability</li><li>You need reliable battery life</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need global warranty</li><li>You want hassle-free software</li></ul><p>Vivo once again managed to deliver the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best camera phone</a> of the year, and the X200 Ultra doesn't have any notable shortcomings.

It has the best AMOLED panel, the best internals, among the best battery life of any phone, and the best cameras available today. I really like what Vivo is doing with its camera tuning and sensor selection, and the brand has consistently proven over the last year and a half that it can not only measure up to its immediate rivals, but also beat any device handily.</p><p>Basically, the X200 Ultra is the best phone I used this year. Even though it isn't sold outside China, I recommend going the reseller route if you're interested in upgrading to a phone with the most versatile camera package you can buy today.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d23f6c5c-e38f-4656-be07-30e2c352f68f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9aFCMCLum49WhRPdCbUkwa.jpg' alt="Vivo X200 Ultra render"><span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Vivo X200 Ultra</span></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title"></div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With outstanding cameras that take the best photos and videos of any phone today, the X200 Ultra easily differentiates itself from its main rivals.

While several people were lauding Samsung for creating a device that is slimmer (5.8mm) than a standard pencil, many were questioning why Samsung chose to trade battery for its design, as the device comes with a 3,900 mAh capacity, making users of the device reach for their chargers more often than not.</p><p>Another report posted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/signs-of-poor-galaxy-s25-edge-sales-samsung-in-trouble/"> SamMobile </a>last month indicated the same slow sales scenario with Galaxy S25 preorders as well. The publication points out how Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%eb%93%9c%eb%94%94%ec%96%b4-%eb%a7%8c%eb%82%ac%eb%8b%a4-%ec%b4%88%ec%8a%ac%eb%a6%bc-%ea%b0%a4%eb%9f%ad%ec%8b%9c-s25-%ec%97%a3%ec%a7%80-%ec%82%ac%ec%a0%84-%ea%b0%9c%ed%86%b5">remained tight-lipped</a> about sales numbers for its latest phone, forgoing any change to boast about preorder numbers as it often does.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQHFCpO6gHE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The publication also added that the same industry sources say "consumer interest in the Galaxy S25 Edge is below what Samsung initially envisioned." That said, it has only been four days since the device's in-store sales began, and considering that the phone is still fairly new, only time will tell if sales begin to pick up.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite some of its drawbacks, the Galaxy S25 Edge still has its perks.

With its 12.1-inch display, it's right in that "almost perfect" range for many, being smaller than something like the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, but still being large enough to enjoy watching videos or getting some work done.</p><p>Speaking of which, a new version of the OnePlus Stylo was also released along with an updated detachable keyboard. Neither of these comes in the box, which is a bit of a bummer, but the new keyboard has a few upgrades of its own. For one, it can be removed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">Pad 2</a> and will remain connected thanks to Bluetooth.

Although it's not the latest and greatest chip to come from Qualcomm, there's really not much that the Pad 2 can't handle. Best of all, the OnePlus Pad 2 won't put too big a dent in your wallet. Even when pairing it with the Stylo 2 and Smart Keyboard, you're looking at a total price of under $800.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hv8NUhNFFZwdogshxor4cR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-9" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Samsung DeX with multiple windows open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hv8NUhNFFZwdogshxor4cR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">2.

Samsung also includes its excellent S Pen in the box, something that we're surprised and thankful to see on a yearly basis.</p><p>The continued rise in popularity of AI features helped spark a peculiar change for Samsung as it opted for the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ as opposed to a Qualcomm chip. Samsung explained that it chose this SoC specifically because of its AI capabilities, which is quite important given the company's focus on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p><p>This focus on AI continued with the release of an updated Book Cover Keyboard, which now dons a dedicated AI key. However, that will set you back another $350, so you might be better served by finding the Tab S9 Ultra's keyboard case to save a few bucks.</p><p>Samsung got a lot of things right with the Tab S10 Ultra, but it's still quite expensive. Even when accounting for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>, this tablet lacks any cellular connectivity, which is a decision that still has us scratching our heads.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-for-gaming"><span>Best for gaming</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="syLPuURwsQ4nYproGe7Vrh" name="lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-usb-ports-highlight-promo-render" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 dual USB-C ports highlight promo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/syLPuURwsQ4nYproGe7Vrh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-2"><span class="title__text">3.

Thankfully, that's no longer an issue as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-announced">Legion Tab Gen 3</a> is essentially the Y700, but rebranded for this market.</p><p>It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, along with excellent battery life.

The reason for this is that it might help determine whether having built-in cellular connectivity is worth considering. Sadly, there just aren't very many <em>good</em> Android tablets with a 5G chip built-in, as even Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is relegated to "Wi-Fi Only."</p><p>Even if the Ultra came with 5G, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Galaxy Tab S10 FE</a> would probably still be our recommendation.

Samsung also offers two different Book Cover Keyboard options, although you'll have to pay a bit more for either of those.</p><p>And when it comes to getting work done, Samsung DeX is just a couple of taps away. While the Exynos 1580 might not be able to keep up with some of the other options on this list, it's still more than capable of being a workhorse. But when the time comes to sit back and relax, the Tab S10 FE is great for that too, and you won't have to worry about finicky hotel Wi-Fi just to watch some YouTube or Netflix.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-compact"><span>Best compact</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WfKEvaGqmBb72EWgP4Z7nT" name="boox-palma-2-white-black-examples" alt="The Boox Palma 2 in white and black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WfKEvaGqmBb72EWgP4Z7nT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Boox)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-onyx-boox-palma-2-2"><span class="title__text">5.

The best way I can think of it is that Onyx made an iPod Touch with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/an-e-ink-phone-isnt-something-you-just-switch-to-in-one-day">E-Ink display</a> that's running Android.</p><p>That makes it so you can still download and enjoy many of your favorite apps and books, while cutting back (and removing) the distractions.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-e-ink"><span>Best E-Ink</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1314px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="JAJ953wjJZzPW4iAdP5SE3" name="Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro lifestyle.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JAJ953wjJZzPW4iAdP5SE3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1314" height="739" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Onyx Boox)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="6-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-pro-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review">6.

If you're looking for something that can also replace an aging or cumbersome laptop, then you'd want something that can be paired with a detachable keyboard.</p><p>If you plan on just lounging around at the pool and want to read a new book that just came out, then we'd recommend checking out an E-Ink tablet.

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>Chances are, you've used an Amazon Kindle before. The first time I set my eyes on that gorgeous paper-like display told me it was the future of display technology, but its obvious limitations meant that future was likely decades away.</p><p>As we near the 20th anniversary of the first Kindle, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions">E Ink is better than ever</a>. It not only supports thousands of colors for a more magazine-like experience, but with refresh rates at around 40Hz, it's finally good enough for all kinds of content, not just books. As a result, we've got E Ink tablets, monitors, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">smartphones that can do basically everything you need</a>.</p><p>But another display technology may replace it in most devices. It's called Transflective Liquid-Crystal Display or Reflective Liquid-Crystal Display, often abbreviated as RLCD. RLCD takes a "traditional" LCD subpixel structure and gives it the reflective properties of E Ink, making it visible in any kind of light without using a backlight, all with up to a 120Hz refresh rate. It sounds like a win-win, but like anything, it's not without its faults. Let's break them down.</p><h2 id="daylight-meet-computer-2">Daylight, meet computer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qM3oqSdt7CnykDqXyHUgA9" name="daylight-computer-youtube-gardening" alt="Looking up YouTube gardening videos on a Daylight Computer in direct sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qM3oqSdt7CnykDqXyHUgA9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've been using a tablet for the past few weeks called the Daylight Computer. While the tablet is typically marketed toward the same crowd that would be interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rise-in-minimalist-phones">a minimalist phone</a>, I'm most interested in it because I can use it outdoors during the summer without squinting my eyes.</p><p>The tablet itself doesn't look particularly special at first glance, but its design is thoughtful and impressive in a way that doesn't shine on a spec list. It has sizable bezels, which is <em>actually beneficial</em> on a tablet, as it provides a convenient area to hold.</p><p>The back of the Daylight Computer is made of a soft-touch material, giving it grippiness that aluminum tablets don't have. Plus, it's got a nice contour that fits your hand, unlike the rest of the overly thin and flat tablets.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2f5_1kGLY60" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>And while these design traits are wonderful, it's the display that really shines for me, pun fully intended. Go outside, turn off the backlight, and enjoy the brightest, fastest display you've ever seen. It's 120Hz, so it's liquid smooth, no matter what you're doing. More importantly, the refresh rate ensures that it doesn't feel slow or sluggish, unlike even the fastest E Ink displays.</p><p>Daylight Computer's founders ensured that the bespoke display was 100% flicker-free. While many displays claim to be flicker-free via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tuv.com/usa/en/eye-comfort.html">TUV Rhineland certification</a>, most of the time that means there's no <em>perceivable</em> flicker, not that the display is actually <em>flicker-free</em>. Daylight Computer is fully flicker-free, doesn't use color dithering or FRC, and is completely eye-safe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1ZZT5bVNA">based on my own testing</a>.</p><p>Its reflective nature also ensures that it works perfectly in any kind of light, and the dual color backlight means it's comfortable to use even in dim light. I particularly love that there's no perceivable ghosting, the way many LCDs suffer from, and the backlight doesn't have that faint glow that most LCDs have, either.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xGH3wHqCQitU56dZFK4HHN" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-03" alt="Reading the Android Central home page on a Daylight Computer and an Onyx Boox Tab Ultra in direct sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGH3wHqCQitU56dZFK4HHN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not the first RLCD device by any means, but it's one of the best examples of how good the technology can be. Of course, like any technology, there are a few downsides. First, Daylight Computer's RLCD is black & white only. While it'd be fair to assume this was done for "minimalist purposes," it was actually due to reflectivity, according to the company's founder and CEO, Anjan Katta.</p><p>Katta told me that transflective LCDs become significantly dimmer when color is added to the mix due to the way pixel color filters operate. As a result of testing, the company decided that daylight visibility was more important than color. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPPsgGndJ48">This review</a> of the HannsNote 2, a color RLCD tablet, shows this off well. Check the 3:50 mark to see what I mean.</p><h2 id="rlcd-vs-e-ink-2">RLCD vs E Ink</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="czmRtUGvDK7VVvnY9TzCUW" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-02" alt="Comparing the build and design differences between the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra and the Daylight Computer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/czmRtUGvDK7VVvnY9TzCUW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what's better, RLCD or E Ink? As with any display technology, the answer depends on your needs. E Ink has been the go-to standard for a long time for anyone concerned with eye health and the negative effects of backlights with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, but RLCD is also completely flicker-free.</p><p>In fact, it's more flicker-free than any current E Ink product because the 120Hz refresh rate falls in the safest range, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">according to research</a>. E Ink needs to refresh the display fully from time to time, and the relatively slow refresh rate (under 40Hz) has the potential to bother people susceptible to epilepsy.</p><p>E Ink also heavily relies on using specific screen modes relative to the content. Faster refresh rates used for videos and website scrolling reduce the overall contrast and detail in order to make E Ink's magnetic dots move faster. RLCD uses a traditional display pixel structure, so the lights are either on or off and don't need to change modes for different content.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CQevW8h8Y5DdEC6MhBmRTf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-viewing-angles" alt="Comparing the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD at an extreme angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CQevW8h8Y5DdEC6MhBmRTf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EW5UGZWHUeM2qu5T2LefSf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-shade" alt="Comparing the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD in the shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EW5UGZWHUeM2qu5T2LefSf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VZz5x4cER2RdZjBMVYBnQf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-devices-off" alt="Comparing the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD with the displays off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VZz5x4cER2RdZjBMVYBnQf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The RLCD screen on the Daylight Computer produces more detail than any of the E Ink tablets I have because of its higher contrast image, but it still somehow comes off looking "softer" than E Ink. Preference will dictate which look you prefer, but there's no denying the difference in contrast the Daylight Computer's RLCD provides.</p><p>Furthermore, color RLCD has issues with contrast on deep colors, based on existing color RLCD tablets, while color E Ink looks great across the board.</p><p>Whites on E Ink also look a lot better as they're actually <em>white</em>. The RLCD on the Daylight Computer has a very warm, green tint to it, which doesn't bother me, but it's worth noting as a quirk of the technology. Viewing angles are also poorer than E Ink, but again, I'm not sure how much this affects actual use of the product.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="6fzt4VYBvLthD4BYyqb2bf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-detail-comparison" alt="Comparing the detail of manga on the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6fzt4VYBvLthD4BYyqb2bf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>RLCD also requires constant power to display an image, while E Ink magnetizes the image once, and it stays there until physically changed again. Think of E Ink a bit like an Etch a Sketch; once the image is there, it doesn't go away until you change or erase it.</p><p>That means RLCD tablets like the Daylight Computer can last days on a charge, but E Ink tablets may last weeks, even with regular use. Regardless of this, RLCD's 120Hz performance may be worth the tradeoff. It certainly is for me.</p><p>I've previously used an RLCD monitor, the EazeEye 1.0, and while that was illuminated from behind by natural light to ensure it's bright enough for normal computer use, I'm confident that a bit more time will produce something similar in a tablet that will eclipse color E Ink for most people. The HannsNote 2 is a great start for color RLCD tablets, and I hope to see more color RLCD tablets with great frontlights in the future.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e9b317d5-88c9-425d-8751-9e39057b473f">            <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/product" data-model-name="Daylight Computer"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:120.54%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9DNJdr87RcUKUButr7w7fJ.jpg' alt="A cropped official product shot for the Daylight Computer"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Daylight Computer</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Get ready for a new kind of tablet that challenges assumptions.

I have been testing the Monitor III for almost nine months now, and my love for them has only intensified.</p><p>I had the opportunity to sit down and chat with the lovely team behind the redesign, and it gave me a deeper understanding of just why the Monitor III headphones are so much better than the older iteration.</p><h2 id="better-in-every-way-shape-and-form-2">Better in every way, shape, and form</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GJ7HejCKoVBssKSnw397KY" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJ7HejCKoVBssKSnw397KY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MrQT7WhavCxCrVvuUzgNCY" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MrQT7WhavCxCrVvuUzgNCY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While the redesign isn't a dramatic rethink, it looks a lot more modern and streamlined now. The Marshall Monitor III <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> are made out of recycled aluminum, silicon, and other materials. The engineers prioritized durability and performance without compromising sound quality and comfort.</p><p>The Marshall Monitor III headphones are the most compact pair on the market. You can twist and contort them to fit into the egg-like carrying case, which is made of leather and lined with luxurious red velvet. I found this size ideal for traveling as the case fitted into my carry-on very easily.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wVbm4DtkuUJcTkEiuajmzX" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVbm4DtkuUJcTkEiuajmzX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The earcups are as soft as marshmallows. I have several piercings, and most headphones often don't sit well, pinching me and irritating my piercings. These cups don't do that, which is a welcome change. This wasn't an accident; Marshall tested with glasses, earrings, and a variety of other variables to ensure a comfortable wear experience.</p><p>These removable cups are made of 40% soft foam and 60% slightly denser foam with springs coiled behind the ears. These cushion ears and, at the same time, efficiently block out sound.</p><p>Marshall used this to improve active noise cancellation, as well as newer, more optimised mics. The ANC is adjustable within the Marshall app, and there's a dedicated ANC button to switch modes as well.</p><h2 id="a-win-for-durability-and-repairability-2">A win for durability and repairability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I love the fact that the Marshall team focused on durability and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/repairability-is-finally-going-mainstream-sort-of">repairability</a>, so users will be able to hang on to their Monitor III headphones for a very long time. The brand assured me that each crucial component of the headphones can be replaced within 10 minutes.</p><p>They even redesigned the circuit board with repairability in mind, reducing its 90 soldering points to 10.</p><p>In line with this thought process, the headband is more flexible now. It is made of TPU, not leather, so it can self-repair from minor abrasions and stay strong yet bendy. The cable connecting both cups isn't inside the band. Instead, it is threaded through the silicone flap underneath to make it easily repairable.</p><h2 id="thoughtfully-remade-from-scratch-2">Thoughtfully remade from scratch</h2><p>Much of the internals of the Marshall Monitor III headphones were remade from scratch, including the audio drivers and acoustics, to achieve the desired performance boost. The makers of the headphones benchmarked them against less commercial-sounding studio monitors.</p><p>Tuned with Marshall's signature sound, these headphones deliver the full spectrum of sound with every instrument standing out clearly and getting its moment in the sun.</p><p>The Marshall app for Android and iOS simplifies the process of customizing your Monitor III. This is the main control hub for your headphones where you can adjust the equalizer, choose presets, or customize your own.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="fSkgMXooq9yC7ZXh5gAF63" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III app screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fSkgMXooq9yC7ZXh5gAF63.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="ZyaXGUPz33VGVRNtS8oG63" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III app screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZyaXGUPz33VGVRNtS8oG63.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Users can also customize the M-button, which is the shortcut button that opens Spotify as a default setting.

The brand straight up doubled the battery life, going from 30 hours with ANC on to 70 — that's right, <em>70</em> — hours of playback with ANC enabled. And once you turn the ANC off, Marshall promises up to 100 hours of playback. It's the wildest uptime I have ever witnessed from a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> of this stature.</p><p>I have put this to the test again and again, getting so bold as to charge it once on an international trip. These headphones did not disappoint. No lie was told here. At this point, I often forget when I last charged the Monitor III.</p><p>I enjoyed constant playback on two back-to-back flights, blocking out the agitating sound of in-air turbulence or the plane's roaring engines taking off. It was a sensory delight with no fear of the battery running out at the back of my mind. What a blissful travel accessory!</p><p>As if Marshall didn't spoil us enough with that ridiculous uptime, these headphones support fast charging. A quick 15-minute charge gives you 12 hours of playback. That's an infallible combo.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-the-marshall-monitor-iii-anc-headphones-2">Should you buy the Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones?</h2><p>Personally, I can find no deal-breaking flaw in the Marshall Monitor III headphones. I'd give them a five out of five, but the lack of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio</a> support must be taken into consideration.</p><p>Another small issue that some folks might have with these headphones is the lack of a headphone jack. Many popular brands like Edifier include a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-headphone-adapter">headphone jack to USB-C converter</a> as well as a standard 3.5mm audio cable with their Bluetooth headphones, since they usually support both forms of wired audio playback.</p><p>Marshall chose to forego the standard audio port, though you can still use the Type-C port for wired audio playback. There's also a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in the case, which can be used to connect the headphones to a computer or laptop that has an audio jack.</p><p>However, there's no way these minor drawbacks should hold you back from buying such a great, well-designed product. Something that's designed to last and is easily repairable deserves praise. This pair of headphones is Auracast-ready and has an insane battery life to boot, so I say go ahead and purchase it. You certainly won't regret it!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0d40c8ec-e03d-4f41-aca0-1ea5824846f2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgNt9n6pWoCVoaKSua5PdL.jpg' alt="Marshall Monitor III"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Marshall Monitor III</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star half"></span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="90" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Made to last</strong></em></p><p>The Marshall Monitor III delivers 70 hours of battery life with ANC on, is future-proof thanks to Bluetooth Auracast, and has easily repairable parts that are durable to begin with.

One thing users will notice is the Parental Control app now has a cleaner, reworked UI. More importantly, Nintendo announces that the Android app now supports the Switch 2, which is perfect timing as the console is set to launch in a couple of days.</p><p>Nintendo states the app lets parents control a Switch 2's "access to GameChat." Parents can manage which friends their kids can speak to and "when they can use video chat." Additionally, the update gives parents the ability to connect and manage multiple Switch devices, as well as the ability to extend playtime limits with ease.</p><p>When tapping a connected Switch, parents will see a day-by-day breakdown of its activity. If your child has been playing, you will see how long they've played and whether or not you've granted additional time. Parents can then hop into a monthly breakdown to see days played and playtime averages.</p><p>For the playtime limit, parents will find the option to extend it by five, fifteen, or thirty minutes. However, there is an option, marked by Nintendo's Starman icon, to disable the daily limit. This will let your kid run wild in whatever games they're playing without worry (it is summer break, after all).</p><h2 id="just-gamin-2">Just Gamin'</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="u5nAHtby87XiWAArhMsNPG" name="nintend-parental-control-play-activity-update" alt="A snapshot of a parent's overview of a Switch's playtime broken down by days." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u5nAHtby87XiWAArhMsNPG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="46GAaBJXYyqZr4GPVKmHPG" name="nintend-parental-control-extend-time" alt="The Nintendo Parental Control app lets parents easily extend their child's Switch play time by five, fifteen, or thirty minutes with the option to disable the limit entirely, too." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/46GAaBJXYyqZr4GPVKmHPG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>From the play-time limit area, parents can also manage any "restricted features" on their child's Switch or Switch 2. Nintendo states these are age-based restrictions concerning the games your child might play. The update was spotted early this week and should be readily available for all Android users to download/install via the Play Store.</p><p>Since Nintendo broke the news earlier this year, we've known that the Switch 2 was on pace for a June 5 launch. That means we're only two days away from having it in hand, and this parental control app update is likely in preparation for that occurrence. Aside from the device's redesign, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/">Switch 2 sports a new feature</a>: GameChat. The added "C" button lets users initiate a chat with friends that lets them share their screen to make it feel like you're right next to each other.</p><p>Moreover, there's a camera that users can grab to make things feel a little closer.</p><p>While we eagerly await the Switch 2 this week, it seems that Nintendo is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/this-is-how-nintendo-aims-to-stop-switch-2-emulation">trying to avoid Switch 2 emulation</a> on Android devices.

Google today, June 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-public-notebooks/" target="_blank">announced</a> public notebooks are arriving in NotebookLM. With a few clicks, any NotebookLM user can create a public notebook by generating a shareable link to the notebook.</p><p>This might sound similar to how shared files work in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a>, but there are a few key differences. For starters, public notebooks are view-only, so there's no avenue for collaboration on the sources and information within a NotebookLM project. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM</a> is all about customized studying and learning experiences tailored to the specific user, and that isn't changing.</p><p>While a NotebookLM project's sources can't be changed, there are still plenty of ways to interact with a public notebook using AI features. You can create a podcast-style explainer with Audio Overviews, generate an FAQ sheet for simple studying, or have AI write a briefing document. There's also the option of conversing with the Gemini-powered chatbot to ask questions about the source material within the NotebookLM public notebook.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aDWqzqEj9s9BA3Nz6eqsKe" name="Notebook-LM-Public-Notebooks-2" alt="Sharing a NotebookLM notebook with others using the new Public Notebooks feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aDWqzqEj9s9BA3Nz6eqsKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To create a public notebook, users need to click the <strong>Share </strong>button in the top right corner of the NotebookLM and select <strong>Anyone with a link</strong> under the <strong>Notebook access</strong> section.

A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/24379" target="_blank">listing</a> added to the Wireless Power Consortium's database Monday, June 2 revealed that an unreleased Samsung handset gained Qi2.1 certification. That is likely to be the Galaxy Z Fold 7, though some key details are missing.</p><p>The Samsung device added to the WPC database carries a model number of <strong>SM-D637U</strong>, which doesn't match the company's recent pattern for foldables. However, the South Korean tech giant's WPC entries have often featured different model numbers for pre-release products. For instance, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 received Qi certification under the model number <strong>SM-D617D</strong>, whereas its official model number is <strong>SM-F946</strong>. The Galaxy Z Fold 6's entry was similarly unique with a <strong>SC-55E</strong> model number.</p><p>Regardless, this unreleased Samsung phone appears to be the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7. This listing confirms that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-qi2-wireless-charging-support">the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will support Qi2.1 charging</a>, but it's unclear what kind. The WPC made things confusing when it broke off Qi2 into standard Qi2 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">new Qi2 Ready certification</a>. The latter means that a device supports the full technology of Qi2 or Qi2.1, but does not include hardware magnets for perfect alignment and accessory support.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> supported Qi2.1 Ready, and did not include magnets for complete compatibility with Qi2 and MagSafe chargers and accessories. Samsung and the WPC suggest that customers complete the experience by purchasing a Qi2-certified case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1409px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-floating" alt="A supposed rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, showing its real panel with a vertical triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1409" height="786" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the slim form factor of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it stands to reason that this foldable will also support Qi2 Ready — and won't include magnets. For many, this won't be much of a noticeable upgrade over the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both the current and upcoming foldable will charge at 15W, and won't have magnets.</p><p>There's also a clear oddity with this WPC database entry, and that's the power profile listed for this smartphone. It is entered as BPP, or Baseline Power Profile, signaling that the phone only supports 5W wireless charging. Of course, this isn't going to be the case for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, as that would be a clear downgrade.</p><p>If anything, this is a sign that the WPC database entry is somewhat of a placeholder until the Galaxy Z Fold 7's official release, and could be subject to change.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

However, Samsung isn't likely to include built-in magnets, meaning Qi2 Ready support with cases and accessories is the best we can hope for on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. </p></article></section><h2 id="explaining-the-qi2-and-wireless-charging-situation-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-2">Explaining the Qi2 and wireless charging situation on the Galaxy Z Fold 7</h2><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> hasn't been officially announced yet, so we don't know for sure whether it will earn Qi2 certification or pass up on it. With that being said, we can look to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series as a baseline for what we might see on the company's upcoming foldable.</p><p>Like the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, the latest Galaxy S25 supports 15W wireless charging, meeting the minimum standard for Qi2 certification. By comparison, the current Galaxy Z Fold 6 also supports 15W wireless charging, which would be sufficient for the Qi2 standard.</p><p>If Samsung follows the example set by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, it could easily gain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 Ready</a> certification for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 by maintaining the same wireless charging speed as the current generation.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/24379">recent listing</a> at the Wireless Power Consortium for an unknown Samsung device points to Qi2 support. The unreleased device is likely a foldable and could be the Galaxy Z Fold 7, sporting the Qi 2.1.0 spec, the same as the Galaxy S25.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4026px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-11" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4026" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qi2 Ready is a new offshoot of the Qi2 standard that ditches the requirement of magnets. Qi2 requires magnets for perfect alignment with chargers and accessories, whether they're MagSafe or Qi2-certified. However, the Qi2 Ready options passes off the magnets to supported accessories, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/consider-adding-magsafe-adapter-for-android">MagSafe sticker ring</a> or a Qi2 case. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Samsung used Qi2.1 Ready for the Galaxy S25 series</a>, making it fully compatible when paired with a Qi2 case.</p><p>If that sounds confusing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">it's because it is</a>. As a prospective Galaxy Z Fold 7, what you really need to know is that your device will work with all Qi and Qi2 chargers due to its expected support of 15W wireless charging. Since this spec is a carryover from older models, it's a near-guarantee. You'll also need to know that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will almost certainly <strong>not</strong> include magnets, so you'll have to get a case or accessory for full Qi2 support.</p><p>Whether Samsung will apply for Qi2 Ready certification from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-does-not-require-magnets">Wireless Power Consortium</a> is unclear at the moment. Currently, no rumors or leaks point to Samsung actually including built-in magnets on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. It elected not to do so for the Galaxy S25 series, and embedded magnets would be an even trickier task with the limited internal space available within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to retain the same charging speeds as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 across the board. It should support 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-charging-speed">We have all the details here</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b9c4295b-99db-46d3-9f87-37e8a798f7a5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:98.61%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qk9BrbQMCLYk6ofsRaMfP.jpg' alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 render in white"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still the latest and greatest</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still the newest Galaxy foldable you can buy, and it's getting cheaper and cheaper.

It should also be Qi2-ready, which means you should be able to use it with Qi2 chargers via a compatible case, just like the Galaxy S25 series. Whether it will natively support Qi2 charging is something we'll have to wait and see.</p></article></section><h2 id="qi2-wireless-charging-on-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-should-be-the-same-as-the-s25-series-2">Qi2 wireless charging on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 should be the same as the S25 series</h2><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is yet to officially launch, but most of the leaks and rumors so far have painted a pretty clear picture of what we should expect. Besides the design changes and spec upgrades, the Z Flip 7 is expected to get a modest bump in battery capacity, but charging speeds are expected to stay the same.</p><p>This would include the 15W wireless charging speed from the Z Flip 6, which should be carried over to the Z Flip 7. This would make the Flip 7 compatible with Qi2 charging speeds if you use the right case. It's unlikely the Flip 7 will have built-in magnets for Qi2, which means you'll have to use Samsung's first-party or third-party cases for the phone to work with Qi2 chargers.</p><p>We could be wrong, and the Galaxy Z Flip 7 (and Fold 7 by extension) might just be one of the first Samsung phones to have native Qi2 charging, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence of this just yet. Whether it would have it or not, the Z Flip 7 is primed to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> out there.</p><p>A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/24379">listing</a> on the Wireless Power Consortium for an unreleased Samsung device (likely a foldable) points to Qi 2.1.0 support, which is promising, to say the least.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3874px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ujGY8cB9FwNz6ubVQPJEgW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-10" alt="Close up of an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back of the Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ujGY8cB9FwNz6ubVQPJEgW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3874" height="2179" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qi2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">expected to come to many more phones</a> in 2025, with the biggest push coming from Samsung and Google.

We tested this in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus review</a>, and it worked just as advertised. With a Qi2 case, you'll also be able to use your Android phone with any Apple MagSafe chargers since Qi2 is essentially built on Apple's wireless charging tech.</p><p>Unlike iPhones, however, most Android phones don't have built-in magnets (yet), so you'll need a Qi2-compatible case for your phone to utilize this charging technology. I'm sure we'll start seeing Android flagships with built-in magnets for Qi2 by the end of the year.

There are some rumors that suggest it might be improved, but whether it's the water or dust protection (or both) that'll be bettered remains to be seen.</p></article></section><h2 id="this-is-samsung-s-chance-to-raise-the-ip-rating-bar-on-foldables-2">This is Samsung's chance to raise the IP rating bar on foldables</h2><p>Samsung was the first foldable manufacturer to introduce an IPX8 rating with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3 back in 2023. This was a big moment for folding phones as it meant they were one step closer to offering the same level of durability as standard flagships.</p><p>An IPX8 rating only guaranteed protection against liquids, though, as dust protection was still absent. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a> had dust resistance before Samsung, but Samsung quickly followed with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and Z Fold 6 by introducing an IP48 rating, where the number '4' stands for protection against solid particles. This was still far from proper dust protection, but it was a step in the right direction.</p><p>With much of the industry only now playing catch-up, Samsung is in a great position once again to raise the bar for foldables. Back in April 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/1909739032264728931" target="_blank">Twitter leaker The Galox suggested</a> that the Z Fold 7 could have "improved" water and dust resistance. If this is in fact the case, then there's a good chance the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Flip 7</a> would also have the same level of improvements.</p><p>Whether these improvements would lead to a higher IP rating is still unknown, so we'll have to just wait for the big reveal to find out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qvvbSu5wsvePygZSzmTuKi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-23.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qvvbSu5wsvePygZSzmTuKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Going by the leaks and rumours so far, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 isn't going to be drastically different from the Z Flip 6, except for maybe a few key areas. Besides the usual processor upgrade and new colors, the outer screen of the Z Flip 7 is finally expected to be an end-to-end panel that envelopes the outer cameras, similar to Motorola's Razr series.</p><p>We're certainly not expecting the specs of this new outer display to be anywhere as good or functional as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-camera-review" target="_blank">Razr Ultra</a>, but having a larger panel with (hopefully) more unrestricted functionality would keep fans and new buyers interested.</p><p>Another significant change will be the software, as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will most likely ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a>. Samsung has released a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-one-ui-8-first-beta-announced-for-galaxy-s25-series">public beta</a> for the Galaxy S25 series, and we've given it a test run and come away quite impressed. It's still a work in progress, so you might encounter a few bugs, but we're loving the performance and functional improvements Samsung has made to its core apps like Health, Reminders, Routines, Internet, Calendar, Contacts, and a few others.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8534c04f-2db7-42a9-9b7f-e8f8a27243b6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJSqkawF7bfM8eXd6UZgr3.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Blue"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Successor coming soon</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 could be good value soon once it drops in price after the Galaxy Z Flip 7 launches.

With a screen size of 6.7 inches, the Galaxy S25 Edge is around the same size as top competitors like the Galaxy S25 Plus and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Specifically, the Galaxy S25 Edge costs the exact same price as the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Although both phones start at around $1,100, things are far from equal when it comes to these two handsets. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> sports a marvelous form factor, but it had to cut a slew of features to achieve that feat. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is a thick and well-rounded smartphone. If you’re choosing between the two, here’s how the phones compare.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-32" alt="All three colors for the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> is like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, but thinner and without a handful of features. That should give you a general idea of what you’re getting with the new Galaxy S25 Edge. Some of the noticeable differences include a dual-camera system, the smallest battery of any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 model</a>, and a stunning 5.8mm thickness.</p><p>You could make the argument that the Galaxy S25 Edge is the antithesis of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.

The Galaxy S25 Edge features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. It's also plenty bright, with up to 2,600 nits of peak brightness. This is a flagship-caliber display, for better or worse — it'll have battery life implications that we'll get to later.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL features a larger and improved 6.8-inch AMOLED screen, capable of reaching a peak brightness of 3,000 nits. Like the Galaxy S25 Edge, the Pixel 9 Pro XL uses a variable refresh rate panel that can fluctuate between 1Hz and 120Hz depending on the situation.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-14" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On paper, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge might look like the more performant smartphone compared to the Pixel 9 Pro XL.

Its secondary camera options leave much to be desired, though. There's just a 12MP ultrawide lens — no telephoto camera — and a 12MP selfie camera. You do get 2x optical zoom by the way of sensor crop, but that's it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a well-rounded system with three rear cameras. You get a 50MP main camera sensor paired with an upgraded 48MP ultrawide lens. Best of all, there's a 48MP telephoto camera supporting 5x optical zoom. The Pixel 9 Pro XL's secondary cameras will blow the Galaxy S25 Edge's ultrawide camera out of the water.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-battery-life-and-charging-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Battery life and charging</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EQTBiMfFUo4QUp5yXgaFYi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-hands-on-11" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge from the botton, showing the USB-C port, speaker grille, mic, and SIM tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EQTBiMfFUo4QUp5yXgaFYi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life and charging typically don't receive their own section in our comparisons, which is a sign of just how important it is when it comes to the Galaxy S25 Edge. The smartphone has a 3,900mAh battery capacity. That's smaller than the base-model Galaxy S25 while packing the same exact screen as the Galaxy S25 Plus. In other words, the display will draw the same amount of power as it would on the Galaxy S25 Plus while using the much smaller battery on the Edge.</p><p>In our testing, the battery manages to last roughly a full day, but you'll likely be on fumes by bedtime, and power users may not be so lucky. Add in the slow 25W wired charging speeds — another casualty of the phone's tiny battery — and the combination is a recipe for disaster. It's definitely something you need to consider when thinking about buying this smartphone.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is on another planet with its massive 5,060mAh battery capacity. The charging speed isn't <em>that</em> much faster at 37W wired, but it's better than the Galaxy S25 Edge.

At $1,099, you’re paying the exact same price as the Pixel 9 Pro XL while getting arguably worse battery life, a less versatile camera, and a bigger display. On the other hand, the 221-gram Pixel 9 Pro is exactly why the Galaxy S25 Edge exists. It’s thinner, lighter, and easier to handle, and that’s its sole appeal. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">I love thin tech</a>, so the Galaxy S25 Edge is incredibly exciting to me, but it’s not for everyone.</p><p>By comparison, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is certainly the better value and the more practical option for most people. It addresses three major gripes with the Galaxy S25 Edge by offering a 5,060mAh battery, 37W “fast” charging, and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom.

The tablet is identical to the regular model, but it comes with the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, delivering much better power.</p><p>The Pad 7 Pro is available for £369 ($498) in the U.K. for the 8GB/256GB version, and it costs just £60 ($81) over the standard Pad 7 in the same storage configuration. There's also a 12GB/256GB model that costs £419 ($565), and interestingly, Xiaomi is rolling out an edition with a matte glass panel that can be bought for £459 ($619).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZGxMEfwcmwRfJpa6QNXBZb" name="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZGxMEfwcmwRfJpa6QNXBZb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The matte glass model comes with 12GB of RAM and 512GB storage, and it uses a custom AG nano-coating layer that ensures you don't see any glare, and it has a better texture if you're interested in using the Pad 7 Pro as a note-taking tool. Xiaomi is being strategic about where it launches the Pad 7 Pro, with key regions like India not getting the tablet — the brand is only selling the Pad 7 in the country.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Nr3a6vgfDZ6G8jJrFzgNob" name="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nr3a6vgfDZ6G8jJrFzgNob.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I still don't understand why Xiaomi chose to imitate the iPad's aesthetic; the Chinese manufacturer has a clearly-defined design language with its other products, and the Xiaomi 15 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">15 Ultra</a> look great. But with the Pad 7 Pro, you're once again getting something that looks identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-ipad-air-2020-review">iPad Air</a>, down to the packaging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yARZkYyAqSsEquk3XAnDab" name="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yARZkYyAqSsEquk3XAnDab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The plus side of the design choice is that the Pad 7 Pro is immediately familiar; it has a balanced heft, and isn't too heavy in regular use. At 500g, it is 40g heavier than the iPad Air while offering a bigger 11.2-inch panel and larger 8,850mAh battery. Much like Xiaomi's phones, the Pad 7 Pro has flat sides, but it has slight bevels that make holding it a little easier.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="6wDu2ifac7i8KdXzXViyKb" name="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wDu2ifac7i8KdXzXViyKb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi didn't change a lot of things with the Pad 7 Pro; it has the same dimensions as the regular model, and the same weight. In fact, the biggest difference between the two is that the Pro model has beefier internals. It also gets better cameras, but honestly, you'll get much better photos and videos with your phone.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3yRqWhzcfipVTUSVJZRhgb" name="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3yRqWhzcfipVTUSVJZRhgb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qAdTHYvrexEf72r4fD3gcb" name="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qAdTHYvrexEf72r4fD3gcb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Other than that, there are no differences between the two, and considering you pay just a little extra, that's not a big deal. The Pad 7 Pro is just as easy to use, and the 11.2-inch panel has good color vibrancy and contrast levels. It isn't an OLED panel like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, but it costs less than half as much.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5012px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="RL3NxN6XzSijtBJaYiLGPb" name="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RL3NxN6XzSijtBJaYiLGPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5012" height="2823" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Considering its mid-range roots, the panel is one of the best around. If you must have AMOLED tech, Xiaomi just debuted the Pad 7 Ultra in China. It's unlikely to make its way to global markets, but it is powered by the brand's new Xring O1 platform, and it is interesting.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZjxZcBNiqQ59nDPvXx2Ajb" name="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjxZcBNiqQ59nDPvXx2Ajb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming back to the Pad 7 Pro, what I like the most about it is that it has excellent power. While the regular Pad 7 did a decent job in this regard, it didn't quite deliver in demanding gaming scenarios — that isn't a problem on the Pad 7 Pro. I didn't see any issues in regular use or with visually-intensive games, and while it doesn't obviously measure up to the iPad Pro M4, it is a fantastic choice if you need an Android-based alternative.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="6wDu2ifac7i8KdXzXViyKb" name="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wDu2ifac7i8KdXzXViyKb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There really isn't much else to talk about the tablet; it uses the same Android 15-based software as the regular model, and you get the same set of features. The tablet will get the same four Android OS updates alongside six years of security updates as the standard model, and that is in line with other products in this category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BuQM5h3uvdnswL6YH9dFZb" name="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BuQM5h3uvdnswL6YH9dFZb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the Pad 7 Pro, Xiaomi is providing a tablet with better gaming potential than the standard model. That's the biggest draw here, and if you don't intend to play many games on the tablet, you'll be better served by the regular Pad 7 instead. But if you need a tablet that does well in demanding games, then you'll need to pay a little more and get the Pad 7 Pro.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7c6609a1-1f3a-43d1-b987-e874e8720e58">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:95.63%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VhKYJaEKp6UFeGmJbCjnQH.jpg' alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro"><span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro</span></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title"></div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Pad 7 Pro has the same design and battery as the regular model, but you get better power, and it makes a difference while gaming. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung's Weather app, Reminder, Health, and Auracast also receive major updates with this new release.</p><p>Considering the rollout of the new Beta has just begun, we can expect Samsung to gradually announce more beta versions and compatibility for additional devices.

For about the same price, you could go with a foldable from Motorola or a flagship, non-folding phone from Samsung. When making the comparison between the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, the difference is clear if you know which basic design you want. However, if you’re not yet sure, you might be weighing the pros and cons of both, as these are two very impressive phones for their respective categories.</p><p>We’re here to help by running through how they stack up against one another in all the most important ways.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-the-design-and-basic-features-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: The design and basic features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xFNMPhveqeXd67tk9F6JRC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-37" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 outside in tent mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFNMPhveqeXd67tk9F6JRC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3963" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you think you automatically get a significantly larger screen with the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 since it’s a foldable, think again. The inner screen is indeed an oversized 7 inches, but that’s only marginally larger than the size of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. With that said, the advantage with this phone is that you can also fold it down to half its size and still enjoy the outer 4-inch screen for crucial notifications, selfies, apps, and more.</p><p>The larger inner screen is a punchy and crisp 1,224p AMOLED HDR10+ Super HD with adaptive 165Hz refresh rate, 4,500 nits peak brightness, and is Pantone-validated for ultra-accurate colors and skin tones. The external screen, meanwhile, is a P-OLED HDR10+ 417ppi screen with an adaptive 165Hz refresh rate, as well as a slightly lower peak brightness of up to 3,000 nits.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes in several colors</a>, including Pantone colors Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Train, and Cabaret, as well as the option for a luxe satin-inspired finish or durable leather-inspired finish. Derrek Lee says in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">review of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> that he loves the brushed metal versus glossy frame, advising that it affords a “rustic sheen.”</p><p>There’s also Italian Alcantara if you’re feeling extra special. If you’re not familiar with that material, it’s the same type used for luxury items like bags from Louis Vuitton or premium cars. Finally, opt for an FSC-certified wood housing if you want something a bit more rustic. Bottom line: you get options <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">not just with colors but materials</a>, too.

The hinge is reinforced with titanium, making it strong and able to withstand frequent folding and unfolding throughout its life, more so than the company’s previous generation devices. Lee says it springs open with a satisfying click and is noticeably stronger and easier to open.</p><p>While you only have a limited view of content on the external screen, you can customize it to your liking through the use of dedicated panels.

You get a higher-resolution Quad HD+ (3,120 x 1,440) Dynamic AMOLED 2x display, but a lesser 120Hz refresh rate. Peak brightness is just 2,600 nits, which is still decent for viewing in bright sunlight. In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">review of the Samsung Galaxy Ultra S25</a>, Andrew Myrick says the screen looks “absolutely stunning.”</p><p>The S25 Ultra is available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-color-should-you-buy">a few more color options</a> than the Razr, including Silverblue, Black, Gray, Whitesilver, and the Samsung-exclusive Jetblack, Jadegreen, and Pinkgold. The phone is built with a strong titanium frame alongside Corning Gorilla Glass Armor 2.

Andrew's one issue with this phone, when it comes to usability, is that he misses having the external screen of a foldable, which he has found to be invaluable for multitasking.</p><p>One area where the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra excels is in terms of longevity.

Now, it's a product you can actually use as Gemini Live on millions of smartphones — both iOS and Android devices. However, there's a lot more to Project Astra than the live video and screen sharing capabilities that recently became available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> users.</p><p>Focused initially on bringing versatile, multimodal AI capabilities to Android, Project Astra has evolved into a far-reaching research project aimed at achieving Google's vision for a universal AI assistant. That means Project Astra is working on key AI features like agentic intelligence, native audio, memory, accessibility, tool use, and much more.</p><p>In other words, the upgraded Gemini Live experience isn't the finish line for Project Astra — it's just the beginning. If you're curious about all Project Astra encompasses and how it'll affect platforms like Android and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, you're in the right place. Let's break down everything you need to know about Project Astra and how you can try it now.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-project-astra-what-is-it"><span>Project Astra: What is it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5953px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="h3HBCreJv6uMev4xjqHrpE" name="Project-Astra-1" alt="The Project Astra sign at Google I/O 2024." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h3HBCreJv6uMev4xjqHrpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5953" height="3969" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Project Astra is known for a few high-profile applications already, but Google's definition of the project is simple. It's a "research prototype exploring breakthrough capabilities for Google products — on the way to building a universal AI assistant," according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/models/project-astra/" target="_blank">Project Astra website</a>.</p><p>That's a vague explanation of Project Astra, and it's probably on purpose. While the project began as a vector for testing multimodal Gemini support for live audio and video, it's expanded to become much more. Now, parts of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">Project Astra are operating under the Gemini app arm at Google</a>, like the ones working on Gemini Live. Others are still working on experimental prototypes and applications for Google DeepMind.</p><p>Here are a few Project Astra features and applications we currently know about:</p><ul><li>Multimodal live video and screen sharing support (Gemini Live)</li><li>Native audio dialogue</li><li>Proactive responses without lag or interruption</li><li>Context-aware dialogue</li><li>Agent highlighting that understands the context of your device screen</li><li>Tool use and interface control to complete actions on your behalf</li><li>Personalized reasoning specific to the user</li><li>Content retrieval from the web or past interactions</li><li>Multimodal memory</li><li>Visual Interpreter to support the blind and low-vision community</li><li>Integration with prototype Android XR glasses</li></ul><p>Currently, many of these features are still in the prototype stage and are only available to select testers. The big exception is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">Gemini Live</a>, which we'll talk about in detail later.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-project-astra-how-it-works"><span>Project Astra: How it works</span></h2><p>Project Astra is a tweaked version of Gemini with enhanced multimodal and agentic capabilities. For trusted testers, Project Astra is available as a standalone app. It works by utilizing multiple knowledge sources and advanced reasoning to provide more comprehensive assistance than a typical search engine or AI chatbot. This could include Gemini models, information found on the web, visual or auditory cues, data that's on your screen, or personalized knowledge from your Google activity or past interactions.</p><p>It works by quickly processing all these data points at once, and the result is Project Astra being able to communicate with a user in natural language with accurate context. This is achieved by using native audio dialogue that can understand different accents and emotions in 24 languages.</p><p>Newly announced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">Google I/O 2025</a> are Project Astra's agentic capabilities. In other words, the prototype AI assistant will soon be able to take actions on your behalf. It can understand what's on your screen in the context of your conversation, using visual cues to show you where to look. It can also utilize Google features such as Search, Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and more to complete tasks on your behalf.</p><p>You can see this in action in the I/O demo video for Project Astra, which demonstrates how a user can control their phone and solve daily problems hands-free.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JcDBFAm9PPI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>We see the person in the video asking Project Astra to find manuals, highlight key points in PDF files, and call businesses on their behalf. This is a perfect, real-world example of Google's vision for Project Astra. In the end, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-vision-world-model-explained">universal AI assistant</a> should be able to control your phone — and perhaps your computer or smart glasses — without you needing to lift a finger.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-project-astra-features-and-platforms"><span>Project Astra: Features and platforms</span></h2><p>The long-term goal is for Project Astra to expand to multiple platforms, and for now, Google has its sights on smartphones and smart glasses. The company says that this prototype "integrates seamlessly with prototype glasses to see the world as you see it — for an even more immersive and helpful experience."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-5" alt="Android XR prototype glasses and Pixel smartphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After trying the experience on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">prototype Android XR glasses at Google I/O</a>, it's clear Astra aims to bring everything we've already covered — including multimodality, memory, visual analysis, and agentic control — to a wearable form factor. This is a long way out from reaching consumers, as Google's smart glasses aren't expected to hit shelves until 2026 at the earliest.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DBpTh8fifHXNyQzbx6AePW" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-5" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DBpTh8fifHXNyQzbx6AePW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Available now is the Project Astra experience for Android and iOS smartphones, also known as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a>.

The document details the EU's "Ecodesign Regulation," which will soon begin to force smartphone OEMs to provide five years of updates (at minimum) for their devices and consumers.</p><p>There's speculation that this regulation could have a lasting impact on how smartphone makers provide updates globally, too.</p><p>Now, there's a major note to be taken here with this new information: this new five-year rule applies to OS and security updates <em>after </em>"the end of sales." This new rule will also reportedly involve tablets, too.

These eco-friendly design rules for devices in the EU require manufacturers to state how tough their phones/tablets are to drops/dust/water and to ensure their batteries are strong enough to "withstand 800 charge and discharge cycles while retaining at least 80% of their initial capacity."</p><p>Repairability of a device is also required to be stated by OEMs. Moreover, makers should make sure parts for repair are available for at least "7 years after the end of sales of the product model on the EU market."</p><p>It's worth remembering that Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">just like Samsung</a>, has shifted to a seven-year update cycle for devices.

What this means is your device is still relatively constricted to the tech packed inside it. For example, Samsung states many of its AI features depend on its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">Personal Data Engine</a>," a software that essentially needs the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>Older chips aren't going to cut it this time.</p><p>This is likely a hurdle consumers will still have to grapple with, more so if they're interested in using these newer, more advanced AI features.

Does that mean they hear everything around them all of the time?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p><p>Hi Rob. That's a great question that I think a lot of people wonder about: how much does their smartphone or "smart" device actually hear?</p><p>The easy answer is everything. Yes, <em>Always Listening</em> means just that — it is always listening. It has to so it can recognize when its trigger word or phrase was spoken, then it can try to do something useful. This means that all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-integrates-gemini-for-smarter-home-automation" target="_blank">smart home</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-home-compatible-devices" target="_blank">assistant-powered devices</a> from every company, including Amazon, Google, and Apple, must work this way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HoTM2nNJVAhKsstdBNfEY3" name="Nest-Hub-2nd-gen.jpg" alt="Nest Hub next to a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HoTM2nNJVAhKsstdBNfEY3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The better answer is to explain how it's supposed to work, according to the people who make the products and those who have tested them. Always listening doesn't mean always recognizing or always doing something. I'll use a simple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-mini-vs-amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen">Nest Mini</a> as an example, but as mentioned, this is pretty much the same across all ecosystems and platforms. Any sort of AI or assistant on your phone has to work this way.</p><p>As soon as you plug in and set up a Nest Mini, its microphone goes to work. Every sound that it picks up is analyzed using some low-power software and hardware, and unless you've said "Hey Google", that's the end of it.</p><p>If it <em>does</em> think it's picked up its command phrase, other processing starts to happen. The software tries to interpret the words it has heard into commands the device can recognize, and then tries to act on those commands.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="byQxwxMvsUNpH4Ji9er97S" name="Govee-RGBIC-LED-Strip-Lights.jpeg" alt="Govee RGBIC LED Strip Lights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/byQxwxMvsUNpH4Ji9er97S.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>An example is if I say, "Hey Google, turn off the porch light," My Nest Mini catches the phrase Hey Google so it knows it needs to process what comes next. In this case, it uses speech recognition to determine my request, ensures it recognizes a device named "porch light," and then sends a signal to shut it off.</p><p>If it didn't recognize the key phrase of "Hey Google," it would just keep listening for it.</p><p>If it recognized its key phrase but was unable to figure out what was being asked, or if it were asked to do something it couldn't, it would respond with a generic error like "I'm sorry I don't recognize porch light" or "I'm sorry I can't do that".</p><p>If it "thought" it recognized the key phrase, it would try to figure out what to do next as described above. Usually, it can't do anything because we never really asked it to do anything. In that case, it just goes back to listening. But sometimes, it can be goofy and <em>think</em> it found a command and do something you never asked it to do.</p><p>I have a first-generation Google Home here that will start playing YouTube videos out of the blue at least three times a week because it thinks I asked it to do it. Goofy little gadget.</p><h2 id="what-about-privacy-2">What about privacy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA" name="google-nest-mini-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Nest Mini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tech companies are very specific about what their voice-activated devices will do and how they do it. That's good because having something that hears everything could be a little problematic if not kept on a short leash.</p><p>For example, some of the commands it "hears" are recorded and sent back for someone to check. If it was told to turn off the porch light, someone wants to make sure it did turn off the porch light. It does keep track of everything it hears that it thinks is a valid request for a certain amount of time. Some think that this information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/cox-media-group-active-listening-controversy">is sold to advertisers</a>, though the companies making the smart devices say otherwise.</p><p>If it heard something that wasn't a valid request, it won't keep track of it, according to the companies who make them.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fANtCWfwKDAUisnEp6zesm" name="google-pixel-fold-google-assistant.jpg" alt="Google Assistant on a Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fANtCWfwKDAUisnEp6zesm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, this is a very valid privacy concern. Most people don't want Google to spy on everything they say. I know I don't. Not that I'm saying or doing something I shouldn't be (you never know) but it's the fact that it's none of Google's damn business.</p><p>You really only have two choices: trust that it's doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing by only processing and acting on things it thinks are valid requests, or don't. I can't tell you what to choose here, but if you don't trust it, you should totally not use it.</p><p>Myself? I only ever fully trust something I built with my own two hands while I'm using it myself. I do use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant" target="_blank"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini" target="_blank">Gemini</a>, and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini" target="_blank"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> products, but I'm mindful of where, when, and how. I'd never have one in my bedroom, for example. <em>Especially</em> one with a camera. I do not use any voice-activated smart "stuff" through Apple, Microsoft, or Amazon because I only want to worry about one platform getting more than I want to share.</p><p>You probably shouldn't follow my example and decide if you trust it or not, then go from there. Giant tech companies don't care about you as a person, but are almost assuredly doing exactly what they describe with voice-controlled services and products. Not to be kind, but because it's not worth the problems that would arise if they got caught doing something differently.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, HMD Global — which has never made a Wear OS or Android Wear watch — may have two Android smartwatches in the pipeline.</p><p>Frequent HMD Global leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/smashx_60/status/1928116848127525318">@smashx_60</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Leak-HMD-s-first-smartwatches-will-run-Wear-OS-and-have-a-camera.1026975.0.html">NotebookCheck</a>) posted last Thursday that the company would launch the HMD Rubber 1 and HMD Rubber 1S, with both watches running Wear OS.</p><p>The Rubber 1 sounds like the premium model, with a 1.85-inch OLED display, 400mAh battery capacity, Bluetooth 5.3 and WiFi support, NFC payments, HR and SpO2 sensors, and 2MP camera sensor. Given that display size, it most likely uses a squircle display, which would be a first for Wear OS.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HMD RUBBER 1- oled 1.85" display - 5ATM Waterproof - BT5.3, WiFi, NFC, Accelerometer, heart rate, SpO2- 2MP CAM- Wear OS- 400mAh, USB-C, QiHMD RUBBER 1S- oled 1.07" - 5ATM Waterproof - BT5.0, WiFi, Accelerometer, heart rate, SpO2- Wear OS- 290mAh, USB-C, Qi<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1928116848127525318">May 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We don't know what purpose this watch camera would serve, but given that Apple allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-reportedly-cancels-its-apple-watch-with-a-camera-this-could-be-the-reason">canceled its camera-embedded Watch in May</a>, it's intriguing to see HMD take a shot at one. If it faces upward, it could support selfies, face authentication, or video calling; if it points outwards, it could take photos, though not with very good resolution quality.</p><p>We assume the HMD Rubber 1S is the budget model, with a 1.07-inch OLED display, 290mAh battery, Bluetooth 5.0, and no NFC or built-in camera. It does have an accelerometer for step counting and activities, with HR and blood oxygen data for (presumably) health and sleep tracking.</p><p>We don't have any leaked details on price, release date, or whether the HMD Rubber 1 would use the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> or a different version. But the name "Rubber" implies that it may use rubber materials, possibly to make them durable enough to survive rough treatment from kids.</p><h2 id="these-hmd-watches-may-target-kids-rather-than-adults-2">These HMD watches may target kids rather than adults</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4167px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.40%;"><img id="PXYyxQEwrmsSumxQ7rGTaE" name="Galaxy-Watch-for-Kids-press-promo" alt="A press graphic showing various "Galaxy Watch for Kids"-themed Galaxy Watch 7 LTEs with bright silicone protective cases and kid-themed watch faces, plus various Samsung Galaxy S Ultra phones with the Google Family Link app controls showing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXYyxQEwrmsSumxQ7rGTaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4167" height="2350" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notebook Check points out that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_ng/press/hmd-and-xplora-technologies-press-release">Nokia partnered with Xplora</a>, "a leading provider of smartwatches for children," last October. Their promised aim is to deliver "responsible and mindful devices for young people" and "introduce them to the world of technology in a safe and balanced way."</p><p>This is a growing focus for HMD, which also announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-makes-an-android-phone-that-teens-might-actually-want-to-use">HMD Fusion X1 phone for teens</a> earlier this year. And when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kids' smartwatches</a>, many of our current favorites have either one or two cameras, most commonly a selfie cam for calling parents.</p><p>Normal smartwatches rarely need cameras. They need to sync with a phone to work, so why bulk up the watch with an inferior sensor to whatever's on your phone? But a kid may not have a phone yet, as a standalone watch is easier for parents to monitor and prevents too much screen time.</p><p>Google and Samsung announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-and-google-teamed-up-on-new-galaxy-watch-7-experience-for-kids">Galaxy Watch for Kids</a> earlier this year, adding a new version of Wear OS to the Galaxy Watch 7 LTE with dedicated "teacher-approved" kids' apps, activity monitoring via Google Family Link, and GPS-based location monitoring.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iVKQjD5otADiDj3GMDLoyW" name="fitbit-ace-lte-games-01.jpg" alt="Browsing the games list on the Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iVKQjD5otADiDj3GMDLoyW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Fitbit Ace LTE kids watch </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps Google will announce a more general "Wear OS for Kids," one that's designed to work with squircle displays — possibly similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> OS.</p><p>The leak didn't mention LTE calling, GPS geofencing, or other common kids' watch features, so it's not a guarantee that the Rubber 1 series targets kids. It's just the most likely possibility.</p><p>Whatever the target audience, we're just as fascinated by the idea of the first squircle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> shapes its content for rounded display edges; it wouldn't fit a square-shaped display. But if the HMD Rubber 1 has a 1.85-inch OLED display, that's far too large for any normal circular display, making a squircle most likely.</p><p>That would require a serious Wear OS UI redesign for Google. And if it pulls off this redesign for HMD Global, other OEMs like Samsung <em>could</em> use the squircle UI for their own watches, in theory.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d28a6316-8477-430c-8117-028ce86478a7">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fkfzAa3nceSUcsYgLmsYP.png' alt="Render of the green Samsung Galaxy Watch 7"><span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>The current Wear OS watch for kids</span></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 LTE can be converted into a standalone kids' watch, provided you have a Samsung phone to set it up.

They feature a powerful and capable ANC profile and a slick, clean design that buyers love. The biggest downside is probably the headphones' high price tag, so snagging them for under $300 is a certifiably good deal.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="bf246e4d-5080-4f2b-b18a-90893bb54fa3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: $399.99" data-dimension48="Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: $399.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want industry-leading ANC, EQ, and overall audio quality; you need wireless headphones with a mic and clear call quality; you'd like to have headphones with a long battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you prefer a pair of headphones that can be easily folded and stored; you want headphones that will let you charge and listen at the same time; you'd rather spend more on the new Sony WH-1000XM6.</p><p>Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones are our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones#section-best-overall">best wireless headphones </a>for a number of reasons. Backed by Sony's QN1 processor and a dual-noise sensor, the WH-1000XM5s have ANC audio blocking that's more powerful than those of competitors, and the Sony Connect app makes it easy to customize EQ and the overall audio profile.</p><p>These also include multi-point connection, a battery life of up to 30 hours per charge, and fast-charging through a USB-C cable that adds roughly three hours of playback for every three minutes they charge. Additionally, their suite of four microphones allow for crisp call quality and easy access to voice assistants. It is worth noting that these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">noise-cancelling headphones</a> aren't particularly easy to store away, though this isn't a big deal for most buyers.</p><p>Needless to say, if you don't mind spending a pretty penny on the latest headphones from Sony, the recently-released XM6 are the better pick. But if you want premium headphone technology at an excellent price, skip the newer cans and grab the XM5 today.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It doesn't seem as though this "shortcut" will throw Pixel users into their Now Playing history. Instead, according to the tipster's findings, this button will reside in the Quick Settings pull-down menu.</p><p>After getting it to work, the tipster claims users will be able to tap this button to immediately begin their Pixel's song identification capabilities. When engaged, the shortcut assumes whatever color your Material You theme is to indicate its activation.</p><p>Moreover, the tipster noticed that Google is working on a persistent notification that says "Searching for song..."</p><h2 id="pixels-android-2">Pixels & Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="jmuFbze4VgVDnocNepn8LZ" name="google-pixel-now-playing-notification-example-leak" alt="A snapshot of Google's supposed now playing shortcut's notification, which may show users that it's "Searching for song..."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jmuFbze4VgVDnocNepn8LZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's still more to come with this feature, as the publication states the most important part (song discovery) wasn't working. At face value, it seems like this persistent notification will morph into the song's name alongside the artist and maybe its album title, too. It's still too early to tell, despite Google's development of the shortcut seemingly far in its process.</p><p>As previously stated, Pixel users currently have their Now Playing history to dive into if they have this feature active. If your device is listening for music, it will identify and list those songs on that page. Users can then "heart" their favorite songs or interact with them to receive a YouTube, YouTube Music, or Spotify link. If Google is working on a shortcut for this, one that you manually activate for quicker info, maybe these links will be more forward-facing/present to use.</p><p>Something that might impact more than just Pixel users is Google's apparent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/gmails-new-material-3-expressive-design-is-secretly-hitting-some-inboxes">Material 3 Expressive redesign for Gmail</a>. Some users have reportedly already noticed an entire rework of the layout. Emails will supposedly sit on a dedicated card for added depth. Additionally, the changes seem to facilitate room for more colors, delivering a Gmail UI that is a little more <em>expressive</em>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xrrom-android-16-to-android-xr">which is what Google wants</a>.</p><p>During I/O 2025, the company discussed its biggest UI overhaul, Material 3 Expressive. The whole purpose of this new direction is to design a language that "feels good, makes sense, and helps you do things with ease." More than that, it seems like this will arrive for Android 16, and that's expected to happen in June.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thinness is the name of the game for the S25 Edge and, according to Nelson's research, the phone is "a tad over three-quarters" thick. On the Moh Scale of Hardness test, the device's screen begins displaying scratches at a level 6 before becoming more apparent (and deep) on level 7.</p><p>The titanium sides scratch pretty easily, at least with a sharp box cutter involved. Additionally, Nelson was able to pop the volume and power buttons off the S25 Edge quite easily with it.</p><p>The durability test moves on to some heartache as Nelson scratches up the in-display fingerprint sensor before taking a flame to the screen. For the former, even when scratched quite rigorously, the S25 Edge is still capable of scanning/reading your assigned fingerprint (or thumbprint). Interestingly, after 30 seconds under a lighter, the S25 Edge's display showed no signs of damage.</p><p>More than that, the device surprisingly survived Zach Nelson's bend test. However, Nelson briefly touches on a small compromise to the device's water resistance during this bend test. So check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/yQHFCpO6gHE">the rest of the durability test</a> to see that, and a little about the compromises Samsung had to settle for on this thin phone.</p><h2 id="almost-30-days-later-2">Almost 30 days later</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQHFCpO6gHE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Samsung dropped the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> on May 12, and the device became the fourth official member of the new series. From the leaks to Samsung's official in-person teaser of the device, everyone knew the S25 Edge was designed to be an "even-thinner" phone. Samsung's goal was to strike a balance in power and a premium design despite shaving off a little more.</p><p>The S25 Edge debuted with a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, and a 200MP wide-angle lens.</p><p>Like Zach Nelson also highlighted, the display is akin to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's; however, it lacks much of the glare resistance we've come to enjoy. Moreover, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">in our hands-on</a>, the Galaxy S25 Edge seemed to fare quite well. It was better than expected, but that doesn't mean everything was good, especially with its longevity. Speaking plainly, the Galaxy S25 Edge compromises severely with its battery (remember: they wanted it thin!).</p><p>The phone features a 3,900 mAh battery with 25W wired charging. If you're looking at the Galaxy S25 Ultra or even the Plus, there's a strong argument <em>against </em>the phone in terms of battery life. Nevertheless, if you overlook the compromises, perhaps you've got yourself a new phone.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a95753e5-8a75-40fa-bb46-faecbc2578bc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qR9jhpW8ExE78Mxtp6TGf.jpg' alt="Official render of the Galaxy S25 Edge"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Thin, Powerful Edge</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge bridges the gap between Samsung's powerful flagship phones in a thinner form factor.

We especially love the inclusion of a stylus at a mid-range price point,  the 120Hz AMOLED screen which measures 6.7 inches, and the long-lasting and fast-charging battery.

Also, the pricing is believed to be starting at €850.</p><p>That said, showing up on the Android Show I/O edition, CEO Carl Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-summer-price-confirmed">confirmed</a> that the Phone 3 is on the way this summer and will cost "somewhere around" £800.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tSRJTR9jhzEwzXDLSVJJD5" name="Nothing-Phone-3-leak" alt="Nothing Phone 3 specs leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tSRJTR9jhzEwzXDLSVJJD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roland Quandt on Bluesky)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tipped pricing is significantly larger than the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> when it launched in 2023. It is still understandable as the Phone 3 is touted to be a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a> from Nothing, unlike the predecessor that targeted the higher mid-range Android phone market.</p><p>Quandt further adds an interesting detail about a new Nothing product, their new pair of headphones allegedly dubbed Nothing Headphone 1. Up until now, Nothing has designed and produced earbuds since the company’s inception, but just last month, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-is-talking-big-for-its-debut-over-ear-headphones-landing-this-summer">teased</a> these headphones in a YouTube video where the design team broke down what they’re after, though they’re still keeping the name a mystery.</p><p>The tipster has also shared the expected pricing of the Headphone, which should be starting at somewhere around €300, and it is also tipped to be coming in black and white color options.</p><p>The details of the upcoming products from Nothing are still scarce. Yet, they appear to be targeting the flagship space, and the signature Nothing design language is also expected. Besides, Nothing was also seen dropping hints about the upcoming Phone 3 as it is believed to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1928058744698482832">dropping the popular Glyph interface</a> this time around in favor of a dotted matrix interface, which the latest teaser from the company indicates to some extent.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone (3).

Now, we’re getting a clearer picture as that fresh look slowly starts landing in some users’ Gmail.</p><p>Material 3 Expressive adds some serious flair with responsive animations that make your phone feel way more fluid. Dismissing a notification now comes with this neat little peel-away motion and a matching haptic nudge.</p><p>Gmail’s latest update (2025.05.11) seems to have synced up with Google quietly pulling the trigger on a server-side change, setting the stage for its Material 3 Expressive revamp. Over on Telegram, SparkRadar caught the visual shake-up in action and shared some snaps of the fresh new look (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gmail-material-3-expressive-better-look-3563125/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>At present, Gmail’s look leans on a bold primary color for most of the main screen. That said, areas like the Search bar, bottom nav, and Compose button stand out with their own accent.</p><p>But with the Material 3 Expressive update, the whole layout gets a makeover. The message list now sits on its own raised card with soft, rounded corners and a lighter backdrop, giving it more depth and focus.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.26%;"><img id="armxpf8u8Ewa95v9UmxLvj" name="Gmail-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive update for Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/armxpf8u8Ewa95v9UmxLvj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.26%;"><img id="cUozbRKTYH2gEwTKBJcEpj" name="Gmail-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive update for Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUozbRKTYH2gEwTKBJcEpj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.26%;"><img id="wPTVUg8PCBAzXTThnf6Dnj" name="Gmail-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive update for Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wPTVUg8PCBAzXTThnf6Dnj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="color-explosion-2">Color explosion</h2><p>The Compose button has also had a glow-up.

Thanks to the new card-style layout, there’s way more room to play with tones and shades, making everything feel more layered and visually dynamic.</p><p>On one Gmail account, the account switcher has popped out of the search bar. Other screenshots still show it tucked inside the search bar, which makes sense since server-side rollouts like this often hit accounts individually and not all at once.</p><p>You can spot the card-style UI making another appearance on the email view screen.</p><h2 id="pill-shaped-swipes-2">Pill-shaped swipes</h2><p>Also, true to Google’s earlier teasers, Gmail’s Material 3 Expressive update brings in a new pill-shaped button animation that pops up when you swipe around.</p><p>Like mentioned before, these design tweaks are rolling out slowly through server-side switches. We’re still waiting to see how the rest of Material 3 Expressive shapes up across the rest of Google’s apps and tools.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/sneak-peek-superfans-could-score-an-early-glimpse-of-the-next-pixel-before-everyone-else">hosting a Pixel Superfans event in London on June 27</a>, and while the invites don’t name-drop the Pixel 10, the timing pretty much gives it away.</p><p>It’s looking like an early sneak peek at the new flagship. If that’s the case, it lines up with Google’s recent habit of speeding up its hardware and software launch cycles.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google rolled out the update to make it easier to skim long threads at a glance.</p><p>Starting this week, if you’re using Gmail on Android or iOS, you’ll notice Gemini stepping in with quick summaries right at the top of your emails, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/05/gemini-summary-cards-gmail-app.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> says.

Back then, you had to tap “Summarize this email” to get a quick recap. That summary now shows up on its own right at the top when you open a thread.</p><p>These summaries might actually come in clutch, especially with long or messy email threads. Google says they’ll only show up when Gemini thinks they’re worth it, but if they start feeling more like clutter than help, it could get old fast. If that’s the case, you can turn them off—just know you’ll have to disable Gemini completely in Gmail to make that happen.</p><p>If you’re using Gmail through a school or company account, your admin is the one who decides whether these smart features are on or off. Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10095404" target="_blank">support page</a> says they’re turned off by default in places like Europe and Japan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And in the U.S., it's getting even better as the company is finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/samsung-wallet/tap-to-transfer/">rolling out</a> the new Tap to Transfer feature.</p><p>The new feature's aim is to make peer-to-peer (P2P) payments “quick and convenient” in the U.S. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introduces-new-tap-to-transfer-feature-for-samsung-wallet/">company announced</a> the feature early this month, the feature is now broadly rolling out this week.</p><p>Samsung has collaborated with Visa and Mastercard, with which users will be able to use a debit card that is already stored in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/what-is-samsung-digital-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a> to send money to friends and family — straight into their bank accounts. It works by the NFC tech utilized by Samsung Wallet that swiftly connects to the recipient’s debit card stored in their respective digital wallets — be it Samsung Wallet, Google Wallet, and even Apple Wallet for that matter.</p><p>Additionally, the new Tap to Transfer feature also works with recipients who have their physical debit card, which supports tap-to-pay capabilities — as it will have a connecting chip, which can be used by Samsung Wallet similar to what users pay at a retail store.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.50%;"><img id="QFunmZmWthQvnjw433ibmB" name="Samsung-Wallet-Tap-to-Transfer-feature" alt="Samsung Wallet Tap to Transfer feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QFunmZmWthQvnjw433ibmB.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="594" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another important thing to remember is that Samsung Wallet wouldn’t charge any fees for the Tap to Transfer feature. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/samsung-wallet/tap-to-transfer/#:~:text=Yes%2C%20a%201.75%25%20fee%20(minimum%20of%240.25%20cents)%20is%20applied%20to%20each%20transaction.%20The%20fee%20only%20applies%20to%20the%20sender.">FAQ page on the website</a>, however, mentions that “a 1.75% fee (minimum of $0.25) is applied to each transaction. The fee only applies to the sender.”</p><p>Other than the new Tap to Transfer, Samsung Wallet is the go-to application for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cheapest-samsung-phones-you-can-buy-today">Galaxy phone</a> users as they can store essential things like driver’s license, credit cards, passes, gym membership cards, loyalty and boarding passes, and gift cards, and more. Some college students can even store their student ID cards as well.</p><p>It is encouraging to see Samsung bringing interesting features to its Wallet app as users won’t have to rely on third-party apps for money transfer at least in the U.S. for now, and we hope the feature expands to even more countries soon.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Native Union got an early start thanks to the Voyage, a foldable charging mat that allows you to charge a phone and the Apple Watch together. The design makes the Voyage inherently portable, and the ability to charge two products makes it a decent choice for use on the road.</p><p>I've tested the Voyage for the better part of six months now, and having used it while traveling, I can attest to its charging potential and durability. Native Union may be a new entrant, but it clearly knows what it's doing, and the Voyage combines good build quality with 15W Qi 2 charging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="c6vLNTAHMMD9te5AaQbAmR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c6vLNTAHMMD9te5AaQbAmR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4995" height="2814" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I looked at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/satechi-onthego-3-in-1-is-the-best-qi-2-travel-charger">Satechi's OntheGo collection</a>, and what's evident is that these two products are nearly identical. The Voyage made its debut a year before the OntheGo collection, and Native Union alleges that Satechi stole its designs. I used enough charging accessories to know that brands often end up using the same manufacturer, and we'll have to wait and see if Native Union gets anywhere with its infringement claim.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WpmLpL3jnScrcXAubZqRfR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpmLpL3jnScrcXAubZqRfR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4960" height="2794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming back to the Voyage, it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Native-Union-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger/dp/B0DJCS5Q2N">available for $99 on Amazon</a>, and it is sold in two options — Sandstone and Black. The only limitation is that it doesn't include a GaN charger in the box, so you will need to plug it into a PD charger that delivers at least 27W of power.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5099px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Y7hiJdrsAD6bqEoH6nQRaR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y7hiJdrsAD6bqEoH6nQRaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5099" height="2872" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Voyage has rugged build quality, and the Sandstone color looks elegant.

It goes up to the standard 15W over Qi 2, and you can just as easily charge accessories on the charging mat.

It has an angled design that lets you raise the puck, and it does a great job. Another bonus is that you can use the charger on the side, and this will unlock StandBy mode when an iPhone is charging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4911px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="EbhkNX3dPsLFxYT5Mqh7iR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EbhkNX3dPsLFxYT5Mqh7iR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4911" height="2766" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Voyage folds down when not in use, and the magnets on either mat are strong — I didn't see any issues while charging a dozen or so phones and accessories in the last six months.

The charger goes up to 18W with just the iPhone in use, so it makes sense to use at least a 27W wall plug if you need to charge your smartwatch along with a phone. I paired the Voyage with UGREEN's 160W Nexode Pro, and I didn't see any issues whatsoever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="J8739iAX3QDFoXQM73WgtR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J8739iAX3QDFoXQM73WgtR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Voyage is a good choice if you need a Qi 2 travel charger that's easy to take anywhere.

I only ran 23 miles after averaging 60 my first four months. Several work trips like I/O wore me out, but I have to be honest: The biggest issues are motivation and weather. It's getting hotter in California, and I'm months out from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/youve-quit-your-new-years-resolutions-already-heres-how-to-get-back-on-track">New Year's resolutions</a>. I need a training reboot.</p><p>I suspect many of you are the same. That's why June is the right month to retool our goals, with wearable tech to help.</p><p>The people who organized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://run.outsideonline.com/news/global-running-day/">Global Running Day</a> recognized that people need a training reboot in the summer. They encourage people of all fitness levels to run, jog, or fast-walk a few miles on the first Wednesday of June every year.</p><p>It's a lovely concept, and I encourage people to join the fun with their local running org or shop. Many fitness watches and apps like Garmin, Apple, and Strava will reward you with digital swag. But this is just one day a year, and not everyone loves running like I do.</p><p>So I worked on a more comprehensive three-month plan to survive the summer heat and come out of the season in better shape than when I started, using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> and other tools to keep me accountable. Here's how I recommend you do the same.</p><h2 id="june-focus-on-steps-before-everything-else-2">June: Focus on steps before everything else</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qiyo4WfeEBRQGJxhhJczpj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-vs-Garmin-Fenix-8-steps" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 (left) and Garmin Fenix 8 (right), both showing their respective step counts of 11,442 and 11,747." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qiyo4WfeEBRQGJxhhJczpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even though the 10,000 steps a day rule started off as a marketing gimmick, I truly got much healthier when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walked over 10,000 steps every day for a month</a>. The exact number is arbitrary; the important part is prioritizing consistency more than intensity.</p><p>Why? Because there's plenty of valid reasons to skip a hard workout after a workday: Tiredness, lateness, or responsibilities like cooking dinner will add up until you've spent a whole week slacking. But the only reason to skip a walk is lethargy. You can walk an hour whether it's blazing hot or at night by streetlight, even if you're worn out.</p><p>Plus, if you start doing a summer activity like golfing, pickleball, or softball, you'll naturally get steps even if you're not tracking a specific "activity" like a run or hike. Your smartwatch will keep you honest on how much you've <em>actually</em> moved and if you've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/make-sure-your-smartwatch-calorie-burn-is-accurate-with-this-scientific-calculator">burned enough calories</a> to earn that post-match beer or dessert.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nscnS29GJni7WyKUPAeLU3" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-walking-streak-2.jpeg" alt="A 31-day walk streak graph on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nscnS29GJni7WyKUPAeLU3.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most smartwatches have a widget or Tile showing whether you've hit your steps goal. My Garmin watch gives me badges for hitting 30 miles of walking or 300,000 steps per month, while a Galaxy or Apple Watch will praise you for closing your daily rings. It's a useful way to motivate yourself.</p><p>If you don't do anything else this June, take advantage of the late sundowns and pledge to walk for at least 8,000 steps a day.</p><p>Buy an epic fantasy audiobook or download a podcast that'll keep your mind occupied for dozens of hours, or else use the time to call family. Planned multitasking makes it feel less like wasted time, and you'll end up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">losing weight in the long run</a> simply by staying agile.</p><h2 id="june-to-july-stay-accountable-with-tech-and-people-not-just-money-2">June to July: Stay accountable with tech and people, not just money</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cZbJQ7pnaQLkWeZWYjCEZX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-daily-suggested-workout" alt="A daily suggested workout for an anerobic run on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZbJQ7pnaQLkWeZWYjCEZX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Several watches and apps have great self-guided training tools I'd recommend. Garmin Coach and daily suggested workouts tailor runs, walks, or strength training to your ability level. A Pixel Watch will give you a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">target cardio load</a> and daily run suggestions like Tempo or intervals. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/">TrainingPeaks</a> has well-regarded paid training plans, while brands like COROS have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.coros.com/training">free training calendars</a>.</p><p>All of them share one key problem, though: Only you can keep yourself accountable and motivated, and you wouldn't be reading this if motivation weren't a challenge! Trust me, I get it.</p><p>People use paid incentives like gym memberships to pressure themselves to work out, so they're not "wasting money." But negative motivation only goes so far before shame takes over. You can always tell yourself you'll "go tomorrow" repeatedly when, again, only you are holding yourself accountable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aEoDnzoLj7iS7ZzwE7FyCR" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-team-sports" alt="A Garmin Forerunner 970 sitting atop a pink soccer ball on pavement, with a kid's baseball bat next to it leaned against a bush." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aEoDnzoLj7iS7ZzwE7FyCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's what makes summer a great time for adults to reboot their goals. Unlike students who have sports clubs all year <em>except</em> summer, adults can typically find community activities this time of year for people looking to rekindle their love of sport and make connections.</p><p>Join a flag football league, running club, pickleball class, or any other team or community sport. You're much less likely to flake out without a legitimate excuse because others expect you. It's more fun than a solitary workout, so it feels less like work.</p><p>Some of these activities will continue into fall, but summer is usually when sports and training orgs recruit new members. So take the time this weekend to Google your best nearby options and get signed up for <em>something</em> fun before end of June. You'll still have to work out properly other days of the week, but these community days will keep you limber and motivated.</p><h2 id="july-go-all-in-on-sleep-tracking-2">July: Go all-in on sleep tracking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3850px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="PmC2GCnBzhjJroVcCkEcXB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-03" alt="Sleep data on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PmC2GCnBzhjJroVcCkEcXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3850" height="2166" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to studies cited by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230315-how-the-seasons-change-our-sleep">BBC</a>, people get (on average) an hour less sleep in June than in December, and 30 minutes less REM sleep. Early sunlight wakes you, the long days keep you out and active for longer, social drinking worsens your sleep quality, and warmer temperatures make it hard for your body temp to drop the 2–3º necessary for unimpeded sleep.</p><p>You'll hopefully spend June getting steps and joining team sports that tire you out for better sleep.

My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> notes stats like HR drop, skin temperature, time in sleep stages, restlessness, and duration.</p><p>Of course, many fitness smartwatches track the same stats, if you'd rather not buy two separate devices. What's important is using tools like Garmin Body Battery, Fitbit Daily Readiness, Samsung Energy Score, and so on to keep yourself accountable.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-clinical-sleep-lead-has-cool-ideas-for-future-of-smartwatch-sleep-tracking">interviewed Google's clinical sleep lead</a> earlier this year, and he warned that people are "terrible estimators" of their own tiredness and can function with a "severe amount of sleep impairment that you're not even fully cognizant of."

href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-and-display">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> feels like a breath of fresh air. The standard Galaxy S25 sports a 6.2-inch AMOLED display, which is the smallest of the major Android flagships. That's either a pro or a con, depending on whether you prefer a more compact form factor. This model is also the cheapest of the bunch, starting at just $800 and frequently available for much less with post-launch discounts.</p><p>Don't be fooled, however — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-arent-the-same">the Galaxy S25 isn't like the rest of Samsung's flagship lineup</a>. The base model has shortcomings compared to the pack, like 128GB storage, no support for UWB, and a lower-resolution display without ProScaler AI. Although other AI features, like Now Brief, are available on the base Galaxy S25, the above omissions are notable oversights.</p><p>The cameras also haven't been updated since 2022, and leave a lot to be desired.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-3" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, for the good.

The AMOLED 2X display supports variable refresh rates up to 120Hz, plus loads of other specs like HDR10+ and 2,600 nits of peak brightness. The FHD+ display (1080 x 2340) is still gorgeous to use and plenty bright.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-11" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a 4,000mAh battery and support for slow 25W wired charging, the Galaxy S25 isn't outstanding for battery life.

You can get a full day of charge with moderate usage, easily.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is for the smartphone user who just wants the basics in a compact form factor and at a fairly affordable price.

It's not very original, with the same general design and few hardware upgrades compared to its predecessor. Like the base Galaxy S25, the Galaxy S25 Plus retains the same camera hardware as the Galaxy S22 series. Still, at $999 and packing a 6.7-inch display, the Galaxy S25 Plus tends to hit the right price and size for a lot of people.</p><p>It builds upon the building blocks of the Galaxy S25, elevating them to provide a more comprehensive experience. The device features a larger battery with a 4,900mAh capacity, and the larger size enables a 45W wired charging speed. That addresses a common gripe with the base model, and it's not the only one.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus also starts at 256GB of storage with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care" target="_blank">UFS 4.0</a> support, a UWB chip for precise location finding, and a larger (and improved) QHD+ display with ProScaler AI.

At $1,299, the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn't cheap by any means. However, it tries to justify that starting price with loads of features, including a massive 6.9-inch display, an inbuilt S Pen, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">robust camera system</a>.</p><p>It's the only Galaxy S25 model to receive a camera upgrade this year, although the primary 200MP camera sensor is unchanged. Instead, the ultrawide camera is now using a 50MP sensor, up from 12MP. You also get a 10MP, 3x telephoto lens and a 50MP, 5x telephoto lens. In other words, the Galaxy S25 Ultra offers the best camera system available on a Samsung phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's for power users first and foremost, with a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, 12GB of RAM, and a 5,000mAh battery capacity.

Mixed in with articles about aquarium heaters, the effect of Saharan dust on Florida's ecosystem, and doing your own front-end alignment (don't, trust me), I recently saw that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/tsa-issues-warning-smartphones-devices-172509328.html" target="_blank">TSA has issued another warning about juice jacking at the airport</a>.</p><p>Juice jacking is even dirtier than it sounds. It's when someone plants a computer inside a USB charging station that can try to send <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tech-talk-more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-malware">malware</a> to the things you plug in to charge. We've all seen those charging kiosks, and there's plenty of room to sneak a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> inside to redistribute software you<em> really</em> don't want to tangle with.</p><p>The TSA recommends that you never plug a smart device directly into one of those kiosks. I don't know if they have new intel they aren't sharing or they just wanted to remind us about it, but with that warning in mind, let's talk about how you should charge your stuff on the go.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3979px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-01" alt="Charging the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3979" height="2238" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a couple of ways to make sure you aren't presenting a direct path for malware to get to your phone or laptop through the USB port. One is to carry around a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cukteks-40000mah-battery-pack">battery pack</a> and plug it into the public USB charger, then plug your phone (or whatever) into the battery. Both will charge at the same time.</p><p>Another way is with a power-only cable. A USB cable needs to have two wires to charge your phone, but usually has a few extra wires to carry data back and forth to other things you might want to plug in, like headphones or a thumb drive. You don't need those data wires to charge your phone.</p><p>You can buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Charge-Only-Power-Only-Protector-USBSCHAC1M/dp/B09479KTC9/" target="_blank">a power-only USB cable</a> from anywhere that sells electronics, like Amazon. You can also buy little adapters that only pass through power; plug them on the end of your cable, and it effectively cuts off all the wires except for the ones you need for power transfer. Either is a good choice.</p><p>Use your "regular" cable when you use your own charger — the thingy you plug into the wall. Any other time, use the one that only provides power.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1548px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aR5umpaonXg2VoBZQj4EoW" name="battery-packs-169.jpg" alt="Battery packs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aR5umpaonXg2VoBZQj4EoW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1548" height="871" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The third option, and the one I like, is to use a cable with a switch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OSOM-Privacy-Cable-Blocker-Prevent/dp/B0C41BW4N8/" target="_blank">OSOM Privacy Cable</a>. I picked up a couple of these a while back, and anytime I might need to use a public charging kiosk at a train station or airport, I use one.</p><p>It's simple, and if you're handy, you could make one yourself. It has a tiny switch at the end that connects the data wires when it's in one position and disconnects them in the other. It's not really any better way to protect yourself than using a battery pack or a power-only cable, but to me, it's more convenient than carrying around stuff I don't need.</p><p>What's important is that you use one of these methods. I don't think this happens too often, but I have seen a "compromised" USB kiosk at Oakland International Airport. I know it was, as they were there removing it because it had a small computer inside that was spreading malware. It was kind of cool seeing inside, but not very cool thinking it might have contaminated someone else's belongings. People can be bad.</p><p>We can't tell you what to think or what to do. We can tell you how easy it is to protect yourself from things like this, though. Trust me, spending $20 on cables is way cheaper than getting bitten by malware in the long run.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It will break down, go bad, or wear out eventually, so it's worth thinking about even just a little, but few people do.</p><p>I'm not here to change your mind or tell you how to think, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones" target="_blank">repairability</a> is one of the most important factors for me when it comes to the features of the products I buy. Maybe because I'm good enough at it to be dangerous, or maybe because I'm cheap, but knowing I can fix something at half the cost instead of replacing it is important, even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">my favorite phone</a> is impossible to fix. Dammit.</p><p>If you're one of the people who do care about fixing your stuff, you gotta love seeing what's happening in the world of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> lately. I'm not talking about improvements in the sound department, though I understand that is getting better, but about how companies are starting to make stuff you can either fix yourself or get someone else to fix for you. Awesome.</p><p>Sony's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-post-malone-noise-cancelling-headphones-launch">WH-1000XM6 headphones</a> (man, these stupid names) are the latest set making a bit of a buzz in the way you want your headphones to make a buzz. As iFixit shows us in a teardown video, screws replace a lot of glue, and everything is laid out so you can get to it without cutting open any plastic.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zRyc5aU8pZ0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>It still might look a little confusing once you see all the parts, but compared to the way companies used to bury those parts in glue and plastic, it's a big change. And it's a good change — even if you never plan to fix something like a pair of headphones yourself, this will let a qualified technician do it at half the cost. That's money saved you could spend on other stuff like groceries or weed.</p><p>You might think that fixing an old pair of headphones is nothing new, but we're talking about Bluetooth technology here. You know, with little circuit boards and batteries and ribbon cables. That's a lot different from your old headset held together with electrical tape and speaker wire. Yeah, I have those, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RTvQZUpM864zgAJRcgyg8m" name="fairphone-fairbuds-black-colorway-parts-hero.jpg" alt="The Fairphone Fairbuds in black with replaceable parts scattered about." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RTvQZUpM864zgAJRcgyg8m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even more encouraging is seeing earbuds becoming repairable. I don't just mean the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/fairphone-fairbuds-user-replaceable-parts-launch">Fairphone Fairbuds</a>, though they are the ultimate fixable set of buds you can buy. Companies like Sony, PQ, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/are-amazon-echo-buds-waterproof">Amazon</a> make earbuds that aren't impossible to crack open and fix once they go bad. <em><strong>When</strong></em> they go bad, because they will.</p><p>Unfortunately, we aren't seeing the same from every company. Apple, Samsung, and Google sell some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">very recognizable earbuds</a> that a lot of people use with their smartphones.

Some<em> shouldn't</em> be repairable, like things you plug into the wall or a charging cable, because someone somewhere will get hurt trying to mess with them. Someone like me, probably.</p><p>In the meantime, seeing more of the stuff we buy when we pick up a new phone, being more friendly when it comes to you and your toolkit, is great. Here's hoping other companies see the light and get on board.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One UI 8 brings all of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a>'s perks to the Galaxy S25 for the first time, and beta-enrolled users try out new features before they're publicly released.</p><p>To start, Samsung's AI Select tool is now faster than ever.

One UI 8 also takes multitasking to the next level, with this 90:10 feature, which lets you resize a split window down to 10% of its normal size, helping users switch between two apps with a single tap without feeling like the app is crammed when the screen is split.</p><p>Samsung's Weather app, Reminder, Health, and Auracast also get major glow-ups with this new update. Furthermore, Samsung also confirmed that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">next-gen foldables phones</a> will launch later this year with a stable version of One UI 8.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><hr><h2 id="galaxy-watch-8-series-allegedly-clears-another-certification-2">Galaxy Watch 8 series allegedly clears another certification</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.67%;"><img id="QVzVDQzpLvuF7L8BAZt7Qg" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-and-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-CMIIT-certified" alt="Galaxy watch 8 and galaxy watch 8 classic leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QVzVDQzpLvuF7L8BAZt7Qg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="680" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XpertPick)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/alleged-galaxy-watch-8-series-clears-another-certification-new-leak-claims"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>We might be just mere<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york"> weeks away from the next Unpacked event</a>, and it has been raining leaks.</p><p>The most recent one comes from folks at Xpert Pick who claim to have spotted both watches from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8 series </a>pass through the CMIIT certification (Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology).</p><p>As we can see in the screenshot, both certificates mention model numbers attached to the alleged upcoming wearables, SM-L3350 and SM-L5050, respectively. Previous leaks have indicated that these model numbers seem to be associated with the Galaxy Watch 8 (LTE) and the Watch 8 Classic (LTE).</p><p>The certification notes within the screenshot describe both these devices to have eSIM technology with an independent eUICC chip, which will allow users to connect to cellular networks without the phone, which is what the previous leaks have been indicating as well.</p><hr><h2 id="nothing-is-giving-up-its-glyph-lights-2">Nothing is giving up its Glyph lights</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N" name="nothing-phone-2a-camera-hump-02.jpg" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone (2a) with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-is-giving-up-the-one-thing-that-sets-its-phones-apart"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Nothing has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-emoji-teasers-impending-launch">dropping several hints on X</a> about its upcoming flagship Nothing Phone 3. In its most recent post, it suggested that its next flagship will not have the signature Glyph Light interface on the rear panel, which has been featured on previous models.</p><p>In an almost straightforward post, the company announced the end of the Glyph Interface in an X video, captioned "we killed the Glyph Interface," where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-hands-on-preview-impressions">Phone 1</a>'s lights dramatically blink out to black.</p><p>This could potentially mean that its next flagship device, Nothing Phone 3 may not show up with those rear light, a feature that drew several people to buy the Nothing phones in the first place.</p><p>That said, if the company takes away the one thing that sets it apart, what would its rear panel actually look like? Some speculate that the phone could come with a dot-matrix display on the back. The teasers of Phone 3 had videos with the same dot-matrix pattern, showing a pixelated "3" or Pac-Man-style animations with dots, majorly hinting at a change in visual design.</p><hr><h2 id="oneplus-snuck-in-two-new-phones-on-the-ace-5-series-2">OnePlus snuck in two new phones on the Ace 5 series</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4VvBrdBd4AwWSb6jqNSjzM" name="OnePlus- Ace-5-Racing-series" alt="OnePlus adds two new phones to Ace 5 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4VvBrdBd4AwWSb6jqNSjzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: GSM Arena)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-quietly-launched-two-new-ace-5-series-phones-and-they-look-spectacular"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>OnePlus has just launched two new phones: the OnePlus Ace 5 Ultra Edition and the Ace 5 Racing Edition.</p><p>Designed with gaming enthusiasts in mind, these phones combine sleek design, powerful hardware, and impressive battery life for an "ultimate gaming experience."

Both devices come in three colorways, starting at roughly $346.88 and $249.71, respectively.</p><hr><h2 id="pixel-10-series-colorways-may-have-leaked-2">Pixel 10 series colorways may have leaked</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="w7a4n2raZJiYfYBubQ3fcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders-01" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w7a4n2raZJiYfYBubQ3fcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-color-palette-series-rumor"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-spotted-in-commercial-shoot-revealing-its-familiar-design"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Leaks are pouring in about Google's upcoming Pixel series, and the most recent one speculates on the potential colorways of the device.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/mysticleaks/111?single" target="_blank">MysticLeaks on Telegram</a> claims there might be four options available during the Pixel 10 series launch.

They always felt like enthusiast watches for runners or outdoorsy types, neither of which I am. Additionally, the buttons and confusing UI made them difficult to pick up. However, the Garmin Vivoactive 6 seems to be a remedy to this, offering a fairly affordable alternative with a simple design and a more user-friendly UI.</p><p>The Vivoactive 6 feels like the perfect entryway into the world of Garmin watches, especially if you’re not really a runner. You may not get all the latest and greatest features or specs, as anyone looking for those will have to spend significantly more on a watch. However, the Vivoactive 6 is great for getting the basics, tracking workouts, and keeping you active.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-vivoactive-6-price-availability-and-specs"><span>Garmin Vivoactive 6: Price, availability, and specs</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3683px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="fCUXNW4gNNfAue46C9XxCA" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-07" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCUXNW4gNNfAue46C9XxCA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3683" height="2072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Vivoactive 6 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">announced</a> in April 2025 and went on sale the same month.

It's on the smaller side, which may not suit you if you have larger wrists, but the plus side is that it's neither thick nor heavy. In fact, the watch is very light and comfortable to wear. This is great not only in everyday use, but also when wearing it to bed, as I hardly notice it's on, unlike other smartwatches.</p><p>It's fairly tough, too, although probably not as sturdy as pricier models. You still get solid water protection with 5 ATM, meaning the watch can be submerged up to 50 meters deep, which should appeal to casual swimmers. Gorilla Glass 3 protection should also help keep the display intact, while the aluminum bezel and fiber-reinforced polymer case give the watch a soft feel.</p><p>The OLED display is very vibrant and fairly easy to maneuver, despite the rather large bezels. It's incredibly responsive and bright enough to use outdoors. At just 1.2 inches, I wish the display were larger, but it still serves its purpose.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="bYbMgLLaxKMxfPwAQYTGiB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-06" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 on a concrete surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bYbMgLLaxKMxfPwAQYTGiB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing I noticed immediately after setting up the Vivoactive 6 is that the UI is a significant improvement over the Venu 3, which is the only other Garmin watch I've used. It's not perfect, but menus feel more logical, and other UI changes make more sense, such as accessing notifications by swiping down from the home screen and then Glance shortcuts by swiping up. Quick settings are accessible by swiping down, or you can press and hold the main power button. Settings can also be accessed by holding the back button.</p><p>I think part of what makes this easier to navigate, aside from the revamped software, is that you only have two hardware buttons. As I found having a third button on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> to be confusing, I appreciate the simplicity.</p><p>Overall, the UI feels significantly more inviting for casual fitness enthusiasts and anyone looking to purchase their first Garmin watch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Myc8F9E9a9ayZqH426eeZB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-08" alt="Music controls on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Myc8F9E9a9ayZqH426eeZB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4068" height="2288" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life is quite solid on the Vivoactive 6. Garmin claims you can get up to 11 days of battery life per charge, which I don't doubt. I consistently get a full week of battery life, with one or two workouts tracked per day and the display set to gesture activation. You'd get less battery with the always-on display activated, but I find the gesture option to be perfectly adequate.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-vivoactive-6-fitness"><span>Garmin Vivoactive 6: Fitness</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="warDH6o9Dgr6nmLNSBpWKC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-14" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6, Venu 3, Pixel Watch 3, and Oura Ring 4 next to dumbbells" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/warDH6o9Dgr6nmLNSBpWKC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-venu-3"><strong>Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Venu 3</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately"><strong>Garmin Connect Plus hands-on</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-io-2025-health-connect-support-details"><strong>Garmin is getting Health Connect support</strong></a></p></div></div><p>The Vivoactive 6 doesn't come with Garmin's latest Elevate sensor technology, meaning you won't get the improved accuracy found on models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-and-570-revealed-all-key-upgrades">Forerunner 970</a> or even the Venu 3.

That said, it's clear that this watch is more focused on encouraging users to be active than on pushing them, which, again, would be more characteristic of a Forerunner.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PXefbBe2tNuAhWvQJ2oNT3" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-18" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 daily workout suggestion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXefbBe2tNuAhWvQJ2oNT3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The watch features built-in GPS and supports various navigational systems, which are pretty accurate and handy for tracking your route on runs or hikes. Keep in mind that you don't get an altimeter, which is a downside if you enjoy the outdoors and hiking. You also can't download maps to the watch, which may be a downside for some.</p><p>You do, however, have access to workout videos directly on the watch, which is helpful when following the pre-made workouts created in Garmin Connect. You can also curate your own workout within the app, although this feels like a very time-consuming and tedious task, and I would quit halfway through.</p><p>If you're a weightlifter like me, you'll likely be pleased with the workout tracking. It can automatically detect reps and rest between sets. It's not perfect, but it's quite handy and more accurate than Galaxy smartwatches in my experience, and significantly more accurate than you'll get with a Pixel Watch.</p><p>Otherwise, the watch comes with a variety of workout modes, which should please most users.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4109px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-12" alt="A workout animation on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4109" height="2311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sleep tracking has been fairly accurate, even when compared to my Oura Ring 4.

Notifications can often take up the entire screen, which can be quite annoying when you're actually trying to do something on the watch. Furthermore, the vibration intensity can't be altered, so you'll get a pretty jarring buzz unless you turn the vibration off.</p><p>Speaking of vibrations, the watch features a Smart Alarm that utilizes sleep tracking to wake you up at the optimal time, so you feel less groggy. It sounds great in theory, but I've found this feature pretty useless or annoying. Oftentimes, I wake up ahead of my set alarm, so the Vivoactive ends up just being late to the party when the smart alarm finally goes off. It also only has a 30-minute window, which doesn't seem like enough time to take advantage of a feature like this, especially if your sleep schedule is as erratic as mine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eTYwPtjmSaJ9VV5GsTqVMB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-17" alt="Move Break alert on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eTYwPtjmSaJ9VV5GsTqVMB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3814" height="2145" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Vivo<em>active</em> also has Move Break alerts to remind you to get up and move, which makes sense.

Measuring 5.8mm thick (excluding the camera bump), it’s currently the thinnest flagship phone, although it is still much thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a>, which is 4.21mm thin when unfolded. For comparison, the Edge is between 1.4mm and 2.4mm thinner than the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup.</p><p>It’s not just about the thickness, as arguably the more impactful feature is the weight. At 163 grams, it’s just one gram heavier than the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, but features the larger display of the Galaxy S25 Plus and the primary camera of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> weighs 27 grams more, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is a whopping 55 grams more, or over a third of the total weight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-vs-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-thickness-1" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Galaxy S25 Ultra (left) and Galaxy S25 Edge (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These numbers may seem inconsequential, but they are core to the Galaxy S25 Edge offering. It combines the best features of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> into a phone that’s thinner, lighter, and much more pocket-friendly.</p><p>Once you hold the Galaxy S25 Edge in your hands, the thin profile and light weight quickly assuaged many of my concerns around missing features, the smaller battery, or the lack of a telephoto lens. I didn’t realize that phone thickness was important to me until I used the Galaxy S25 Edge.</p><p>Beyond the design, you get a structure that Samsung has refined over the past few years. There’s a titanium build that feels extremely premium, and it’s paired with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. Despite some concerns about the thickness, especially considering other phones in history that have been thin and bent easily, the Galaxy S25 Edge has shown no signs of bending easily during daily usage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yRPgT7JZSbnDWsdgnDvG5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-16" alt="Left side mmWave antenna and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yRPgT7JZSbnDWsdgnDvG5Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-10" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-11" alt="Right side buttons and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fF77UXEr7SF8QynYJxn45Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-4" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fF77UXEr7SF8QynYJxn45Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The 6.7-inch display on the front is protected by Corning’s new Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, which is virtually identical to the Ceramic glass used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, but lacks the anti-glare finish.

When Samsung first revealed the battery capacity, I expected this to be my biggest challenge, but as it turns out, this is only partially true.</p><p>Like many phone makers, Samsung has been promising all-day battery life on its phones for many years, and most phones deliver with some charge remaining at the end of the day. The Galaxy S25 Edge also delivers all-day battery life, but it gets dangerously close to needing a recharge before the end of the day.</p><div><blockquote><p>Battery life isn't phenomenal, but it's also not as bad as you would expect.</p></blockquote></div><p>Everyone’s usage varies, so what does all-day battery life look like? Charging to full at 11 a.m. (having forgotten to charge it overnight), the Galaxy S25 Edge lasted a total of 28 hours on a full charge with just under seven hours of screen time and around seven percent battery remaining. It’s fairly representative of the maximum battery life you can expect, and that was with light gaming, a lot of streaming, web browsing, and some calls, with half the day on Wi-Fi and half without.</p><p>The battery life meets my expectations for moderate to heavy usage in a day, and should be sufficient for most users. However, it’s much harder to excuse the slower 25W charging, which takes around 80 minutes to charge the phone. Samsung opted against including the 45W charging from the S25 Plus, despite the S25 Edge costing more, which is harder to accept considering the price.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-cameras"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Cameras</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-3" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge camera sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>200MP primary camera from the S25 Ultra.</strong></li><li><strong>12MP ultrawide camera.</strong></li><li><strong>No telephoto lens, quality degrades after 2x.</strong></li></ul><hr><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge has two rear cameras.

the OIS is somewhat ineffective, and the camera is unable to compensate for the loss of detail. Instead, you get photos that have slight motion to them and lack the finesse of other cameras. You also need the larger pixel size to compensate for light in low-light conditions, so the 12MP photos tend to be the best overall.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

Unlike Samsung’s past Edge phones, such as the Galaxy S6 Edge and its waterfall display design, there are no exclusive software tricks on this phone. Rather, you get the same, great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, Galaxy AI, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> experience that you’ll find across the rest of the lineup.</p><p>That includes a smooth interface with bubble-like, rounded edges; a split notification center and quick settings similar to iOS; an app drawer that can finally be laid out vertically in alphabetical order; and greater consistency with other Android devices. I’ve been a fan of One UI for many years, but One UI 7 feels better than ever before.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-32" alt="All three colors for the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another great addition to the software is the deep partnership between Samsung and Google.

Everything else was likely to be extremely solid. Having spent time with the Galaxy S25 Edge, it delivers on two out of the three, but the camera falls short.</p><p>Yet, for some people, this could be the ideal phone.
