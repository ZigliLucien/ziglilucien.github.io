<ul><li>Google announced today that it will be integrating Gemini's multimodal capabilities into AI Mode on Google Search.</li><li>This will help expand Search's capabilities by answering comprehensive questions in one go.</li><li>Google Search's AI Mode becomes available to more "Labs" users in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-multimodal-search/">announced</a> today that it will give<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode"> AI Mode</a> on Google Search more powers to perform its tasks. In a press release the company said that it is expanding its Gemini Capabilities to AI Mode on Google search, with the help of Google Lens.</p><p>"This experience brings together powerful visual search capabilities in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens </a>with a custom version of Gemini, so you can easily ask complex questions about what you see," Google stated.</p><p>It allows users who have access to AI Mode to be able to snap a photo or record a video and ask the chatbot a comprehensive question about what they see. For instance, users can ask exploratory and open-ended questions in AI mode, along with more complicated tasks — "like comparing two products, exploring how-tos or planning a trip," the Keyword added.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MXBH2Hn49YAQcsTHszYWxF" name="AI-Mode-Google-Search-Lens" alt="AI-mode-multimodal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MXBH2Hn49YAQcsTHszYWxF.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI Mode gets this ability from Gemini’s multimodal capabilities. The tech giant added that once this mode is enabled, it can understand every scene in an image, including the different materials, colors or shapes, and arrangements of multiple objects, as seen in the gif above. For example, AI mode is able to read the titles of the books, capture the theme and commonalities of these books, and suggest similar high-rated books to the user.</p><p>It uses a “query fan-out” technique, just like the text-based search option and AI Mode, then issues multiple queries about the image as a whole and the objects within the image. It is important to note that AI Mode will be made available on both mobile and desktop search versions. However, it remains unclear if it's the same for the Lens feature, as the gif shows only a phone using this new capability.</p>

<p>That said, Google started testing the AI Mode only last month and has since received positive feedback from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium subscribers who were able to try it out. Users felt that AI Mode was able to quickly answer their complex and nuanced questions and also gave them a lot more information about a certain topic than a general Google Search.</p><p>Lastly, Google added that it's constantly testing to improve AI Mode based on feedback that comes from users in "Labs." AI Mode is now available on both Android and iOS via the Google app for those with a Google One AI Premium subscription.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini Live's new features are arriving on the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 series starting today.</li><li>The live video streaming and screen sharing features can be unlocked with a Gemini Advanced subscription.</li><li>These features will expand to all Gemini Advanced users on more Android devices in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's slow rollout of Gemini Live's new video streaming and screen sharing features is now reaching all users of the newest Google and Samsung smartphones. Starting today, April 7, owners of the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 series can use the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> features with a Gemini Advanced subscription. The company announced the expanded availability in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-live-android-tips/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>Although the tools are starting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> lineups, they'll later be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-lives-new-video-streaming-and-screen-sharing-to-work-on-any-android-device">available on any Android device</a> that can run the Gemini app. In theory, that means Gemini Live with video streaming and screen sharing should work on Android phone, tablet, or foldable running Android 10.0 or higher.</p><p>The big requirement is the Gemini Advanced subscription, which is available through the Google One AI Premium plan for $20 per month.</p><p>With the new features, users will see two buttons added to the Gemini Live user-interface following the update. There's a camera icon on the left that starts a live video stream, and the stream supports both the front and rear cameras. The button to the right of it is for screen sharing, which only supports sharing the entire screen.</p>

<p>Google provides a few examples of how Gemini Live's live video capabilities can be used, such as for help organizing a drawer or fixing a record player.</p>

<p>For the screen sharing function, Google suggests using Gemini Live to help shop for a particular outfit online. Or, you could use Gemini Live as an extra set of eyes proofreading your work.</p><p>These features are available now for Gemini Advanced subscribers on Pixel 9 or Galaxy S25 hardware, and will roll out to more Android devices in the future.</p>

<p><em><strong>A lot of people ask:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I need to buy a new phone and a particular model caught my eye. Should I buy it or not?</strong></em></p>
<p>A variation of this question is the one I get most often. There are so many phones to choose from, some are obviously going to be better than others, and there is the whole value proposition to look at; you don't want to spend more than you need to or spend it on the wrong thing.</p><p>This question is also one that's impossible for someone else to answer. Good thing it's easy for <em>you</em> to answer, provided you take a bit and consider all you options.</p>
<p>I know, I know, this sounds like a cop-out or a non-answer to a legitimate question. I promise it's not. I have spent more hours than I can count dealing with all aspects of technology and have a good idea of what is good and what isn't, but I don't know what you need and can never know what you want unless you tell me.</p><p>Part of the answer is easier to answer because there are some phones you just shouldn't buy if you need something reliable. If it's made by a company nobody has ever heard of or one we've heard a lot of bad things about, don't consider it. Likewise, read what people who did buy one have to say; if everyone hates it, skip it.</p>

<p>I also tell everyone that being an early adopter often means you end up with a lemon. Never buy the first generation of any new technology if you need something you can depend on; let the people who want one for fun have the first dance. Gen one foldables and their janky busted screens fit nicely here. A few generations later, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">they're fine, dependable products</a>.</p><p>That leaves what you <em>should</em> buy. And here's where you have to answer your own question.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-versus-what-you-want-versus-what-you-can-afford-2">What you need versus what you want versus what you can afford</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tvVexUZxsDbhWduioNC7v4" name="google-pixel-8a-back-bay-10.jpg" alt="The back of the Bay blue Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tvVexUZxsDbhWduioNC7v4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you know these three things, your choices will be narrowed down quite a bit. the trick is being truthful to yourself so you make the right decision.</p><p>I (technically, my wife) was in this situation not too long ago. She needed a phone and she needed it now. She also needed it to be reliable enough to use every day all day, and we didn't have a mountain of money to spend at the time. She decided on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>, and I thought that was a smart decision. It's not fancy, it <em>is</em> reliable, and the price was right.</p>
<p>Of course, she <em>wanted</em> more; something a little more fancy or a little more high-end would have made her happy. But knowing what was needed (a basic, reliable phone with acceptable battery life) and what was priced right (we got a great deal thanks to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a> promotion) helped me make the right decision. We can put a few dollars back and get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">something she wants</a> later.</p><p>This was a phone emergency, replacing something that was damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p>You have to do the same thing. Something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Galaxy A phone</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel A</a> phone might be a good fit at the right price. Maybe you need to step down and buy an ultra-budget phone (or you just want to save money because you're frugal like that). Or maybe you can splurge and get the latest from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus</a>.</p><p>The point is that only you really know the answer here. Make sure whatever you buy is exactly what you need, with as much of what you want and can afford thrown in.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus president Louis Lee teased what will replace the Alert Slider on the 13T: the new "shortcut key."</li><li>The key is said to be "very practical" while also paying homage to the Alert Slider by including various notification modes.</li><li>The 13T was previously teased to arrive with a 6.3-inch flat display and (potentially) a 6,000mAh battery when it launches later in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is continuing to tease its next smartphone launch by giving users some early details about a new feature.</p><p>Over the weekend, OnePlus president <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/Pm85QiJQd?pagetype=profilefeed">Louis Lee teased</a> what consumers can expect from the OnePlus 13 Mini, otherwise known as the OnePlus 13T (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/07/oneplus-13t-alert-slider-button-flat-display-teaser/">9to5Google</a>). In a post on Weibo, Lee stated the OnePlus 13T had been "upgraded;" however, this change will see the company's famous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-alert-slider">Alert Slider</a> disappear (once again), replaced by a "shortcut key."</p><p>Lee didn't get too descriptive about this new physical button, but he mentions (machine-translated) the shortcut key lets users "easily switch between options in a series of operations, which is very practical." The shortcut key pays tribute to the Alert Slider by supporting different notification modes: silent, vibrating, and ringing. There is more to this new button, which Lee states will be revealed "at a later date."</p><p>Meanwhile, Lee builds hype for the OnePlus 13T's display. The post highlights OnePlus user feedback by stating it questioned users who enjoy small-screen phones. The information received reportedly influenced the Chinese OEM's decision behind the 13T's small, flat display. Lee claims, "Everyone who has used it likes it very much."</p>

<p>You could say the Alert Slider is an iconic part of the OnePlus design, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-wants-to-change-alert-slider-and-fans-arent-having-it">many others may agree with you</a>. The OEM's CEO, Pete Lau, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-to-ditch-alert-slider-in-favor-of-new-button">announced</a> in March that it was moving away from the button, opting for a new option that's more personalized. There was quite an uproar on the company's official forums from long-time users who've come to love the unique piece of utility. However, OnePlus seems to feel otherwise as Lau stated the new button (shortcut key) is “incredibly intuitive” and “future-ready.”</p><p>While Lau expressed love for the Alert Slider, there were also concerns that it would eventually be reduced to "minimal functionality." The Alert Slider is reportedly non-reprogrammable due to certain limitations.</p><p>In other news, April held a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-exec-teases-the-oneplus-13t-will-be-a-tiny-phone-with-a-big-battery">teasers from a OnePlus exec</a> who stated the 13T will feature a 6.3-inch display with a large battery. Nothing's confirmed; however, it's been rumored that the phone could sport a 6,000mAh battery, similar to its flagship sibling. Moreover, that could be boosted further by 80W wired fast charging, at least according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-oneplus-13t-just-inched-closer-to-launch-with-fresh-details-surfacing">regulatory listing</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 13T is expected to launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-teases-its-upcoming-13t-as-a-part-of-an-april-fools-prank">later in April</a> with a rumored price tag anywhere from $600-$900.</p>

<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has announced that it will allow users to create their own avatars with the help of Meta AI to make the messaging platform more engaging.</p><p>After the update, users can head over to the Meta AI assistant on the messaging platform and use "imagine" prompts to create their new avatars, which the company terms as upgraded avatars.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="C6ARk5Bk9yvMQESZx6UamM" name="whatsapp-upgraded-avatars" alt="WhatsApp Meta AI upgraded avatars" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C6ARk5Bk9yvMQESZx6UamM.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, as shown in the video, interested users can create AI avatars with prompts like "imagine me in a professional headshot" or some other similar prompts indicating to change your hair or outfit, per your preference. It appears Meta AI is able to create some accurate avatars, which are worth sharing and on the whole it seems to be a fun tool to play around with.</p><p>The company has been testing the upgraded AI avatar feature for quite a while now. The feature was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-could-soon-let-users-create-ai-images-of-themselves">first spotted</a> in testing back in 2024. Users have to bear in mind that these new ones notably differ from what we are used to, the avatars that can be found in Avatar settings in WhatsApp preferences.</p>

<p>There is another new, notable ability on the messaging platform and has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/add-music-to-your-whatsapp-status">rolled out</a> more recently. Users who often share WhatsApp Status updates will be able to do so by adding some music from artists. It is pretty similar to the feature widely popular on Instagram Stories.</p><p>Before hitting the share status option, users would be able to add music by tapping the 'music note' icon at the top and searching/selecting a song that is likely to go along with the photo/video that they want to share.</p>

<ul><li>Amazon highlighted the start of its newest AI test, "Buy for Me."</li><li>The feature will be present to a limited group of U.S. customers in the search results when looking up products.</li><li>The Buy for Me AI will purchase a user's desired product from a given brand's website specifically, delivering your name, address, and payment info on its own.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon's newest AI-based feature enters testing to put users on the fast track when purchasing products from other websites.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-shopping-app-buy-for-me-brands">blog post</a>, Amazon states it has kickstarted a test for its new "Buy for Me" shopping experience on Android and iOS for a "subset of U.S. customers." To sum it up, the company says Buy for Me leverages its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/">Bedrock AI software</a>, which provides "agentic capabilities." It's because of this that the feature can handle the entire task, from beginning to end, without user interference after the command.</p><p>To get started, those with access to the feature will notice it when viewing the "Shop brand sited directly" category in the search results. Tapping such an item will produce a page of product details. Afterward, Amazon states users can tap "Buy for Me" to request the company's AI to purchase the item from that other brand's website directly.</p><p>Amazon's shopping director, Oliver Messenger, said, "We’re always working to invent new ways to make shopping even more convenient, and we’ve created Buy For Me to help customers quickly and easily find and buy products from other brand stores if we don’t currently sell those items in our store."</p><p>Users will find the agentic capabilities of Buy for Me take over by "securely providing" your information: name, address, and payment. The company stresses that it does not have access to what you've previously purchased on another website.</p>

<p>Once completed, Amazon states customers will receive a confirmation email from the brand (website) its AI made the purchase from. However, you will be able to track is whereabouts from "Your Orders" in the Buy for Me Tab in Amazon's Shopping app. If anything goes wrong, like you're unsatisfied with the order and would like to return it, the post states users will have the ability to contact the brand's customer service.</p><p>While the test starts in the U.S. for a limited group of customers, Amazon says brand stores and products are also limited. It adds that there are plans to "incorporate more" brands and products alongside wider availability of the Buy for Me test.</p><p>Amazon continues to plug more AI into its shopping experience after it debuted its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-rufus-beta-rollout">Gen AI assistant, Rufus</a>. The AI is a conversational tool customers can utilize while shopping as it's trained with product information and the ability to answer a person's queries. Moreover, Rufus can make product recommendations and help you find new items when shopping.</p>

<ul><li>Google has launched a fun interface for all those Pokémon fanatics out there, to relive their childhood.</li><li>The fun animation pops up when users search for a Pokémon, and they're prompted by a Pokéball to catch it.</li><li>Google even provides hints for this Pokémon hunt, so the user can catch 151 first generation Pokémon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google comes up with fun ways to interact with its users. Be it through Google Doodles or fun puzzles to make Google Search less redundant. This time, the tech giant is taking the Easter egg hunt to another level.</p><p>It looks like a collaboration between Google and the Pokémon Company that allows users to "catch" 151 first generation Pokémon and then add it to their Pokédex within their Google search profile.</p><p>To participate in this hunt, users must sign in to their Google account and look for the first Pokémon that pops into their heads. Then, a Pokéball appears at the bottom right corner of their screens. When tapped, it will attempt to catch the Pokémon in question.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:201.50%;"><img id="u58G2zvc2rphyE4QoTZXNf" name="Pokemon-hunt-google-search" alt="Attempting to catch Onix" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u58G2zvc2rphyE4QoTZXNf.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="806" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once the Pokémon is caught, the user will be prompted to continue searching for the rest of them with a hint to each Pokémon in the list.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/553132/google-pokemon-pokedex-easter-egg-secret">Polygon</a>, Google sent them a news release stating that a  Legendary or Mythical Pokémon will require Master Balls to catch, which can be earned by catching regular Pokémon. For instance, once you catch the first 20 Pokémon, you'll be given a Master Ball with a hint for the legendary Pokémon.</p><p>At each checkpoint, you can only capture the specific legendary Pokémon that corresponds to the silhouette that Google shows you. Any attempt to catch a different legendary Pokémon will cause the Poké ball to open, and users will lose the Pokémon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fvAvBV7GJ7nKJkFrLXMf98" name="Pokemon-hunt-google-search" alt="Pokémon in Google Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fvAvBV7GJ7nKJkFrLXMf98.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication further adds that Google didn't cite any reward for the person who catches em' all. However, it did note that “searches for ‘Pokemon card’ reached an all-time high in the US” this February.</p><p>Still, it's probably just a fun interface to bring back nostalgic memories for some, while the satisfaction of catching all the Pokémon without running around the city for them.</p><p>It is important to note that Google's new Pokédex widget is only available on mobile and requires logging into a Google account to save your progress.</p><p>This isn't the first time that Google has tapped into nostalgia. Last year, for Easter, Search was turned into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-retro-block-breaker-easter-egg" target="_blank">retro </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-retro-block-breaker-easter-egg">"Block Breaker" game.</a> Like the original game, Breakout, users had a single paddle, one ball, and four rows of Google-colored bricks to break into.</p>

Although the Boom 4 came with a few improvements, including the addition of a USB-C port instead of a Micro-USB, the Boom 3 still boasts impressive audio quality, IP67 water and dust resistance, and a solid battery life. It's also easy to pair up with other Ultimate Ears speakers, in case you want to double up while the discount price is available or you already have another one.</p><p>This is also the lowest price this speaker has ever been, so it might be worth picking up if you don't mind the outdated micro-USB charging port.</p>

<hr>
<p>T'is One UI 7 rollout day(Apr 7)! Samsung seems to have kept its promise as it has begun rolling out the stable build for Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6 users in Korea and other regions.</p><p>According to Tarun Vats via his X post, Samsung has first released the stable One UI 7 for Galaxy S24 users, who were already on the beta version in Korea. These are supposedly the build numbers for the trio-bearing F956NKSU2BYCK/ F956NOKR2BYCK/ F956NKSU2BYCG versions. Similarly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and Z Flip 6 users in the Korean region have also started getting the stable release.</p>

<p>The rollout seems to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1909174186276159805">quickly reached</a> non-beta users too who are using the Galaxy S24 series with the S928NKSU4BYCG/ S928NOKR4BYCG/ S928NKSU4BYCG build numbers.

Although Samsung started releasing beta versions of One UI 7 for the Galaxy S24 series and the aforementioned foldables last year, the stable release has been delayed when compared to the previous iterations’ rollout.</p>

<p>The One UI 7 is a notable upgrade as it brings tons of new features, improvements, and more Galaxy AI innovation. The Galaxy S24 series was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">promised</a> with seven years of OS upgrades, and this stable marks as the first one as they shipped with One UI 6 when launched last year.</p><p>While the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6 are the first ones to get the stable One UI 7 starting in Korea, the predecessor models, including the S24 FE, are expected to be receiving it within the same month.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is a new entrant in the budget space and is the successor to the Galaxy A35 5G. The most notable upgrades include more years of OS upgrades, HDR video recording with the front camera, faster charging, and a brighter display. The A36 5G also has a more premium design, which makes it a solid phone to have on your  shopping list. For roughly $100 more though, there's also the Pixel 9a that's worth considering for its flagship-grade processor and software.</p><p>While the new Galaxy A56 5G is more of a direct competitor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>, that's coming later in the year whereas the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A36 5G</a> can be bought right now, in the U.S.. Looking at the Samsung Galaxy A36 5G vs. Google Pixel 9a, should you spend that extra $100 for the Pixel or get the Samsung and spend that money on accessories? Let's find out.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a36-vs-google-pixel-9a-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy A36 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="x29TmvkFSEihfYMYfBi3Gb" name="samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-lifestyle-official-169.jpg" alt="Galaxy A36 5G lifestyle ad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x29TmvkFSEihfYMYfBi3Gb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1062" height="598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has tweaked the designs of the new A series once again, making them look more up-market than before. The Galaxy A36 5G features flat sides with curved portions for the button area and narrower bezels around the display compared to the older model. The camera bump design has changed from individual cutouts for the lenses to a singular vertical pill-shaped layout. The phone is available in two colors, Awesome Black and Awesome Lavender, the latter of which is the better shade in my opinion.</p><p>The Galaxy A36 is slimmer than the Pixel 9a at just 7.4mm, but it's heavier at 195 grams. I don't mind this since the A36 5G is one of the few budget phones to sport a glass back, and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus at that. This is the same scratch-resistant glass used over the massive 6.7-inch display. It's a Super AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate and a high peak brightness of up to 1,900 nits. The body of the phone is also IP67-rated for dust and water resistance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HqrWLy2Ro9cTHCgLrY4HcA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-iris-in-hand" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a held in hand, the photo taken downards to emphasize its color and size." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HqrWLy2Ro9cTHCgLrY4HcA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a has an interesting new design which will take some getting used to. It's lighter than the Samsung at 186 grams, but is thicker at 8.9mm. The back panel is plastic which is what contributes to the lower weight. The 9a does come in some cool pastel colors like Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony. All those that hate rear camera bumps will love the Pixel 9a's design as the back is nearly all flat. You do get an aluminum frame though which is sturdier than the plastic frame on the Galaxy.</p><p>Despite being $100 more, the Pixel 9a's display looks more of the budget variety than the A36, mainly due to the thick bezels. Scratch protection is not the best either as it uses the much older Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display is pOLED though, with a 120Hz refresh rate and up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness. The size of the display is smaller than the Samsung A36, which is not ideal for media consumption but it is a lot more pocketable. Google has kicked it up a notch with weather resistance as the Pixel 9a now gets an IP68 rating, just like most flagships.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fBis82cK9vYnAaS27WKZ3V" name="samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-official-battery-ad-169.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A36 5G in front of battery shape segmented into lifestyle images" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fBis82cK9vYnAaS27WKZ3V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has launched just one variant of the Galaxy A36 5G in the U.S. with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage for $399.99. Other regions will have more variants like 8GB RAM and up to 256GB of storage. The 6GB of RAM is a bit concerning considering this phone will be supported for the next six years. Powering the A36 5G is a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chip, which is presumably a small step down from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-6s-gen-3">Snapdragon 6s Gen 3</a>, which was not too different from the Gen 1 chip from 2021. It's a strictly mid-tier processor, so you can expect similar performance, which is to say, decent multitasking and casual gaming but not much else.</p><p>The Pixel 9a on the other hand uses the Tensor G4 SoC, which is also found in Google's flagship phone range. While it's no match for Qualcomm's best, it will certainly be better than the processor in the A36 5G. This makes the Pixel 9a better suited for gaming and heavier workloads. The 9a starts at $499 and goes on sale on April 10, 2025. It has 8GB RAM and two storage variants of 128GB and 256GB.</p>

<p>Samsung doesn't specify how long the Galaxy A36 5G will last but given the 5,000mAh capacity and mid-range chip, you should expect at least a day and a half, if not more, on one charge. A lot of it will also depend on the types of apps you use and how many run in the background. Charging is fairly quick thanks to 45W wired charging speeds, which is something we haven't seen before for this series. The charger will have to be bought separately though. Wireless charging is missing, which I don't think many would care about at this price.</p><p>The Galaxy A36 5G features a 50MP main, 8MP ultrawide, and a 5MP macro camera. There's a 12MP camera on the front. Compared to the previous model, the A36 can now shoot 4K HDR video with the front camera as well. We've yet to test the Galaxy A36 so it's hard to say how good or bad the cameras will be, other than they should do just fine for your Instagram posts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2176px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ekcYdE9agPmm82HBkVrasA" name="google-pixel-9a-official-ad-1-169.png" alt="Google Pixel 9a cover variants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ekcYdE9agPmm82HBkVrasA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2176" height="1224" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a comes with an equally large battery of 5,100mAh, which again, should easily offer multi-day battery life. This is the largest battery we've had yet on any Pixel. Charging speed is much slower though, at just 23W with Google's 45W adapter. As a consolation, you do get wireless charging at 7.5W if you're a fan of this technology.</p><p>Cameras is one area where the Pixel 9a will no doubt dominate. The 9a has a 48MP main and a 13MP ultrawide on the back, and a 13MP module in the front. Just like the Samsung, the 9a can also shoot 4K with the front and rear cameras. It might not have a macro camera, but it supports features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus.</a></p>

<p>Both phones are pretty evenly matched in terms of software support and features. The Galaxy A36 5G ships with One UI 7 which is based on Android 15, and will be getting six generations of OS upgrades and six years of security patches. This is the first time Samsung has pledged such as long-term support for its A series phones. The A36 5G also gets some AI features from the flagships like Circle to Search and Enhanced Object Eraser, but not the full roster. To differentiate this AI suite from the S series, Samsung is calling it "Awesome Intelligence" instead of Galaxy AI.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9a has the same software as every other Pixel 9 series and that's great, because you get all the AI features from the more expensive models. The 9a will also be getting seven years of OS and security upgrades, which is more than the Galaxy. However, Google already has an expiration date in mind, which means the 9a will get whatever Android version was launched before that. The A36 on the other hand has been promised six "generations" of updates, so depending on how Google plans its future Android releases, the Galaxy might just end up getting the same number of Android versions as the Pixel.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a36-vs-google-pixel-9a-which-one-offers-better-value-2">Samsung Galaxy A36 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Which one offers better value?</h2>
<p>It's actually a lot tougher to pick a single winner here since they both deliver incredible value at their price points. At $400, the Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a>. It offers similar features as the Pixel 9a and does a few better like the 45W charging, a slimmer design, and a more scratch-resistant screen. You're not really missing out on much other than maybe gaming performance, limited storage, and no wireless charging.</p><p>The Pixel 9a starts at $100 more, but offers a more robust IP rating, a brighter display, a more compact body, a lighter design, wireless charging, and a more potent processor. It also has more AI tricks than the Galaxy and an extra year of updates.</p><p>If you happen to find both at a similar price at some point during sales, I'd pick the Google Pixel 9a in a heartbeat.

Maybe you are holding onto an older model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a> or even still sporting the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Google Pixel Watch</a>. As you explore everything it can do, you have probably looked into ways to make it personalized as well. This might include choosing a cool watch face and adjusting the view of apps, which can be organized in either a list or grid view.</p><p>With a list, you’ll see the alphabetized names of each app line by line. Scroll up and down to find and select the one you want. With grid view, the apps create an icon formation on the screen, displaying three in a row. Scroll through and you can find and select the one you want based on recognition of the symbol. But how do you switch this view? It’s super simple.</p>

<p>1. From the main watch face, tap the <strong>side Crown</strong>.</p><p>2. When the App List opens, <strong>scroll</strong> all the way to the bottom.</p>

<p>4. The apps now appear in the Grid View.</p>

<p>Note that alternatively, you can also swipe up from the top of the home screen to open Settings. Select General, App View, and switch to Grid View from there.</p><p>Many people prefer the grid view since quite frankly, it looks cooler. And once you’re familiar with your apps and the usually easily identifiable icons, you’ll love this view. If you find, however, that it looks too cluttered after you download more and more apps, you can switch back to List View at any time using the same steps.</p><p>Switching from List to Grid View and vice versa works, it should be noted, on all three Pixel Watch models to date, including the original Google Pixel Watch, the Google Pixel Watch 2, and the latest Google Pixel Watch 3, one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">the best Android smartwatches</a> on the market today. You just need to make sure you’re running wearOS 5.0.</p>

<p>Garmin recently refreshed both its Instinct and Fenix product lines with new offerings, and they've immediately become two of the best long-lasting sports and adventure watches available. The Garmin Instinct 3 and Fenix 8 can be found in multiple case sizes and AMOLED or MIP/Solar configurations, so there's almost certainly a style that meets your needs between them.</p><p>When considering the Instinct 3 or Fenix 8, the decision comes down to a single question: is the Fenix 8 worth double the price of the Instinct 3? On paper, the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> handily outdoes the midrange <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Garmin Instinct 3</a>, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the better value. Let's break down exactly how these two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">great Garmin smartwatches</a> compare, and who they're each made for.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-instinct-3-vs-fenix-8-design-and-display-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. Fenix 8: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZZBTbeicHteBzFibiwPv8X" name="IMG_9788" alt="A Walking activity on the Garmin Instinct 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZBTbeicHteBzFibiwPv8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 and Fenix 8 are both rugged watches built for the outdoors, but the latter features a more premium design. The Instinct 3 uses a mix of fiber-reinforced polymer and aluminum, giving it a softer, rubber or silicone-like texture. Meanwhile, the Fenix 8 uses a steel or titanium construction with Gorilla Glass or sapphire cover glass.</p><p>Both watches have a 10ATM water-resistance rating, with the Fenix 8 taking that a step further with dive capabilities and a MIL-STD-810H certification — a military-grade durability standard. As a result, the Fenix 8 is heavier, with the steel variant weighing 74 grams and the titanium option weighing 64 grams. The Instinct 3 weighs just 59 grams by comparison.</p>

<p>Garmin ships the Instinct 3 and Fenix 8 with silicone bands by default, but they each can be configured with nylon and leather straps instead. The Fenix 8 also has a metal band option available, which could dress the steel or titanium chassis up for special occasions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RCxiWbRBqe4ySWPAXTcZsW" name="IMG_9791" alt="A left-side view of the Garmin Instinct 3's three buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RCxiWbRBqe4ySWPAXTcZsW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Fenix 8 is available in more case sizes, starting at 43mm and topping out at 51mm. There's also a 47mm configuration right in the middle. Garmin sells the Instinct 3 in two size options: 45mm and 50mm. You'll see a 43mm Instinct watch on Garmin's website, but that's the Instinct E, a cheaper watch with a completely different feature set.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eJdCTaTDPe9awCzVhgfudX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-side-view" alt="A close-up side view of the Garmin Fenix 8 with the default watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eJdCTaTDPe9awCzVhgfudX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin's Fenix 8 has better hardware and more software features than the Instinct 3, full stop. It starts with the display, where the Fenix 8 uses a 1.3-inch or 1.4-inch AMOLED panel compared to the Instinct 3's 1.2-inch AMOLED panel. As previously mentioned, there are MIP options that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">tend to look worse than AMOLED and are less responsive</a>, but offer longer, "unlimited" battery life with solar charging.</p><p>We don't know which processor powers the Fenix 8, but the Instinct 3 is powered by the ARM Cortex M4. The Instinct 3's lowly processor, paired with its comical 17MB of RAM and up to 4GB of onboard storage, is the reason why it doesn't support many software features. It can't save offline maps, and you may find yourself needing to delete or offload saved workouts just to install updates because the storage threshold is so tight.</p>

<p>The Fenix 8 gives you a lot more to work with, featuring 1GB of memory and 32GB of storage. That's plenty to store workouts, offline maps, music, and more. It also has Wi-Fi support, but otherwise matches the Instinct 3 in terms of connectivity. Both watches support Bluetooth, ANT+, NFC for Garmin Pay, and multi-band GPS.</p><p>The differences start to come in the hardware health sensors, starting with the heart rate sensor. The Instinct 3 uses the same, older sensor as the Instinct 3. The Garmin Fenix 8 is equipped with the latest Garmin Elevate v5 sensor, which is more accurate and adds an ECG function. For what it's worth, while the Elevate v5 sensor is more consistent, our reviewer found the Instinct 3 reaches the same average BPM as a good armband monitor.</p><p>Plus, GPS accuracy is on par with the Fenix 8, so not everything on the Instinct 3 is a downgrade. With that being said, the Fenix 8 just has <em>so many more</em> software features, including a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone"><u>rucking mode,</u></a> offline maps, estimated hydration and electrolyte loss widgets, dive capabilities, ski maps, strength training tools, and the fully featured Garmin Coach.</p><p>It's impossible to ignore the fact that the majority of Fenix 8 features are available on the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>, which isn't as rugged as the Instinct 3 but still offers up to 23 days of battery life.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6yCzpWUu8vnDcukBcpqwDM" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-vs-2X-vs-2-rocks-close-up" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, Instinct 2X Solar, and Instinct 2 Solar sitting on rocks next to one another." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6yCzpWUu8vnDcukBcpqwDM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Arguably, the only reason the Garmin Instinct 3 can challenge the Fenix 8 is due to the AMOLED upgrade this year. It's still not a touchscreen, so you'll need to fiddle with clunky buttons to navigate Garmin OS at times. However, the screen is beautiful and bright, and fun color combinations help the Instinct 3 add to its sporty look. With plenty of health sensors and basic Garmin training features, the Instinct 3 does give you <em>almost</em> everything you need.</p><p>Certain things, like the lack of offline maps, GPX exports, and a touchscreen, are going to leave some adventurers wanting more. To get those features, you're looking at the $900 Enduro 3 or the $1,100 Fenix 8. As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-has-underwhelmed-me-despite-how-great-it-is">whether the Garmin Fenix 8 is worth more</a> than double the price of the Instinct 3, that's for you to decide. If you're someone who regularly pounds the pavement or the trails, or is a multi-sport athlete, I could definitely see the appeal.</p><p>For most of us, the Instinct 3 is hands-down the better value. But if you have high training demands and a lot of cash, it's hard to look past the Fenix 8's enticing features.</p>

Even in 2025, there are still plenty of devices from Samsung, Google, and other brands that ship with 128GB of on-device storage or less. That's why it's important to stay on top of your storage usage, cleaning up old files as necessary.</p><p>Luckily, Android includes a few built-in storage management tools with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-has-a-new-pdf-viewer-and-its-ditching-google-drive">Files by Google app</a>. Using the Clean tool, Trash bin, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-files-removes-photos-backed-up-to-google-photos">Smart Storage features</a>, you can make sure you have plenty of space for all your apps, music, videos, and more.

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-the-clean-tool-to-free-up-space"><span>How to use the Clean tool to free up space</span></h3>
<p>The easiest and best way to quickly free up storage space on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> is to use the Clean tool. It's built into the Files by Google app, and will work on any device. Essentially, the Clean tool will scan your device for old files, photos, screenshots, and more that you might not need. Then, you can browse through the selections, deleting anything unnecessary to save space.</p><p>Here's how to use the Clean tool in the Files by Google app:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Files by Google app</strong> and tap the <strong>three-button menu</strong>.</p><p>2. Press the <strong>Clean tab </strong>in the list.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Arrow</strong> <strong>icon</strong> beside your storage breakdown for a detailed look at what categories are taking up the most space.</p><p>4. Return to the <strong>Clean tab </strong>by swiping left and looking for suggested items to delete. Depending on your storage breakdown, you might see suggestions like <strong>Delete old screenshots</strong> or <strong>Delete junk files</strong>.</p><p>5. Select the <strong>files you want to delete</strong>. You can select them all, or select individual files, and press <strong>Move files to Trash</strong> when finished.</p>

<p>Smart Storage is a handy Pixel-exclusive feature that takes the hassle out of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android">manually deleting unnecessary photos</a>. When enabled, Smart Storage will "permanently delete media backed up to Google Photos that's been on your device for 60 days."

<p>1. Open the <strong>Files by Google app</strong> and tap the <strong>three-button menu</strong>.</p><p>2. Press the <strong>Settings tab </strong>in the list.</p><p>3. Flip the toggle beside <strong>Smart Storage</strong>.</p>

<p>Most people have likely found themselves needing to claw back megabytes or gigabytes of space on their phone at some point or another in crunch time. Maybe you really needed to download an app or take another video. Either way, many Android users don't think about storage until they run out.</p><p>However, the better solution is to keep an eye on your storage usage before it becomes a problem, regularly deleting unnecessary content. Things like photos, videos, and messages in particular can take up a surprising amount of on-device storage space. Whether you're using the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> or another Android smartphone, there are plenty of Files by Google features to help you clear space.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy S25 Enterprise Edition gets eight years of major OS updates, outlasting the regular models’ seven years.</li><li>These business-focused models get Android updates all the way to Android 23, plus security patches until January 2032.</li><li>The S25 Enterprise Edition is loaded with the full Knox Suite for top-tier security and business tools like Knox Manage, Knox Capture, and Knox Remote Support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S25 Enterprise Edition is set to outlast the regular models when it comes to major OS updates.</p><p>After making its global debut in January, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> lineup got another boost in February. That’s when Samsung officially rolled out the Enterprise Editions of the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and the S25 Ultra.</p><p>Unlike the regular Galaxy S25 models that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">set for seven years of Android and security updates</a>, the Enterprise Edition takes things a step further. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungknox.com/en/knox-platform/supported-devices/aer" target="_blank">Samsung Knox website</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-enterprise-edition-8-major-android-os-updates" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>), these business-focused versions are promised Android updates all the way to Android 23, marking a full eight years of major OS support.</p><p>These devices will also keep getting security patches all the way through January 2032, on top of those major Android upgrades.</p>
<h2 id="security-that-goes-the-distance-2">Security that goes the distance</h2>
<p>Built with businesses in mind, the Galaxy S25 Enterprise Edition comes loaded with the full Knox Suite. That means defense-grade security plus handy tools like Knox Manage for keeping devices in check, Knox Capture for smart data collection, and Knox Remote Support for quick IT help.</p><p>Thanks to Knox, these devices earn the “Android Enterprise Recommended” badge, meaning they’re built to handle long-term business use without breaking a sweat.</p><p>As a nice bonus, Samsung throws in a free one-year Knox Suite subscription with every Enterprise Edition device. You’re also getting Microsoft Office and Google Cloud preloaded, so it's ready to get down to business right out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="same-power-extra-muscle-2">Same power, extra muscle</h2>
<p>Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 Enterprise Edition packs the same punch as the regular models, including the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB of RAM, and more.</p><p>Furthermore, the Galaxy S25 Enterprise Edition comes loaded with smart AI tools like real-time call transcriptions with auto summaries and a Writing Assist feature to help polish your work emails.</p>

<p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">latest and greatest Samsung phones</a> have gone on sale worldwide, Samsung is taking a more selective route with the Enterprise Edition and rolling it out in just a handful of markets.</p><p>Samsung is no stranger to long-term support for its professional-grade devices, and the Enterprise Editions are keeping that tradition alive.</p><p>The fact that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> Enterprise Edition had the same update timeline as the standard model makes the S25 Enterprise Edition’s eight-year support stand out even more.</p>

<p>Last year, I wrote about how I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-im-done-with-heart-rate-monitor-chest-straps">done with heart rate monitor chest straps</a>, for both comfort and accuracy reasons. Cut to 2025, and I still don't find them especially comfortable to wear. But after testing the new Garmin HRM 200 against the Polar H10 and COROS HRM across multiple runs, I'm happy to admit that I was overly harsh on chest straps.</p><p>Garmin sent me the HRM 200 with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Instinct 3</a>, which I've been testing for months. By contrast, I shoved Garmin's chest strap into a drawer and <del>subconsciously suppressed its existence</del>, <em>ahem</em>, forgot about it until this week.</p><p>The Garmin HRM 200, like any chest strap, cuts out the wrist-based optical middleman and directly reads your heart's electrical signals for better accuracy. It's water resistant, highly affordable at $79, and lasts about a year before you need to swap out the batteries.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, I found it uncomfortable. But it did outperform my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>'s Elevate v5 optical sensor for accuracy, for the sticklers who need near-perfect data. It's not standalone like the Garmin HRM-Pro, but otherwise, chest strap fans should love it.</p><p>I decided to test the Garmin HRM 200 and Polar H10 against each other — and against my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HRM armband</a> that I much prefer — and give chest straps another chance to impress me.</p>

<h2 id="my-simple-beef-with-chest-straps-2">My simple beef with chest straps</h2>
<p>Chest straps aren't kind to people with dadbods. The strap naturally digs into my skin at the fit necessary to keep a consistent, non-slip connection.</p><p>I've lost enough weight in the past year that this is less of an issue than before, but my real complaint is how a chest strap keeps me out of the "zone." It hugs my chest with every breath, reminding me that my performance is being monitored and judged at all times, and making me self-conscious if my breathing rate gets high.</p><p>But I acknowledge that my dislikes may not apply to you. I think I'm more hypersensitive to tight clothing — like ties or skinny jeans — than other people. Just because <em>I</em> don't like chest straps doesn't mean I can ignore them; it's my job to give them a fair shake.</p>

<p>My more fundamental Polar H10 issue was how it produced bizarrely erratic results across several runs in 2024, no matter how well I adjusted the fit or wet the contact sensors.</p><p>Eventually, I discovered that my Polar H10 only worked as intended when connected to a smartwatch. I was using the option to track workouts directly in the Polar Beat app, and for whatever reason, the wonky phone-strap Bluetooth connection would sub in deflated readings at odd moments that badly skewed the results.</p><p>Once I started syncing my Polar H10 to a watch, it became a reliable control group for my accuracy tests. But I remained a bit suspicious that chest straps were overhyped.</p><p>Now that I had <em>two</em> chest straps, I decided it was time to see just how consistent these devices are, and if the accuracy gap is worth the trade-offs.</p>

<p>My only way to compare all three straps' data was to wear three smartwatches — Garmin Fenix 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS PACE Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a> — connected to each, with the Garmin HRM 200 and Polar H10 stacked atop one another on my chest and the COROS optical sensor on my arm.</p><p>Aside from being a goofy-looking setup, I could only hope this close chest strap proximity wouldn't interfere with the results.</p>

<p>My hour-long, high-aerobic run started off shaky, with COROS' data elevated by about 30 bpm, Garmin taking a minute to catch up, and Polar having one early, random dip. But everything stabilized quickly, and there were no other issues for the remaining 58 minutes.</p><p>The chart above shows how all three devices compare, while the chart below focuses on the two chest straps. All three straps measured a 168 bpm average.</p>

<p>Typically, wrist-based optical sensors fall 1–3 bpm short in my tests, with a noticeable delay when I change my pace or climb hills. The COROS HRM still shows a bit of that lag, but it's minimal enough that only the most fussy of runners would notice.</p><p>As for the two chest straps, they're in near-lockstep for the majority of the run, which impressed me!</p><p>The bigger accuracy test, as always, was the track workout. I foolishly ran it the next morning when I was still tired, so I struggled to hit my usual max-HR levels. But I still got almost three miles of sprints, hard running, jogging, and walking, challenging my heart rate monitors to follow the rapid changes.</p>

<p>This time, there were noticeable gaps between the three devices. Both COROS and Polar lagged slightly behind Garmin's HR peaks and valleys instead of the two chest straps leaving the armband behind.</p><p>That doesn't mean Garmin's HRM 200 is more accurate, necessarily. The Polar H10 may have been slightly disadvantaged, placed beneath the HRM 200 so it wasn't as close to my heart. And I don't know if Garmin's <em>spikier</em> graph than Polar's steady one means it was faster at catching tiny HR fluctuations or was just slightly more inconsistent.</p><p>(<em>Note: </em>Ignore the Polar H10's one awkward flat-line near the end; it's a known issue where Polar's data freezes on the last HR result when you pause a workout. I tried to avoid pausing, but like I said, I was exhausted.)</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Garmin HRM 200 and COROS HRM both showed a 174 bpm average and 188 bpm maximum, while the Polar H10 fell 1 bpm short at 173 and 187, respectively. I'm happy to chalk that up to awkward chest placement, and it's <em>much</em> better than how my H10 performed in the past.</p><p>If I contrast that with every track workout test I've done with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a>, some wrist-based optical sensors are better than others, but even the best will fall a few beats per minute short of the mark. I understand why people rely on specialized HRM straps for the best data.</p>

<p>I'm always happy to change my opinion when confronted with new information. After a week of dual chest straps and wearing multiple watches at once, I can state what most people would consider obvious: chest straps' data is more consistent than I gave them credit for.</p><p>But I'm <em>not</em> budging on the other part of my argument. Yes, the COROS HRM optical readings aren't as immediately responsive and accurate as the Garmin HRM 200 or Polar H10. But the gap is so <em>minimal</em>, and an armband vanishes from my consciousness after five minutes while a chest strap takes up mental real estate the entire time.</p><p>Basically, unless you truly need the best-possible accuracy, I'd point you towards a COROS HRM or Polar Verity Sense to improve on your watch's unreliable readings — and I hope Garmin considers an arm-based sensor of its own.</p><p>If you're not as hypersensitive to tight devices as I am, the Garmin HRM 200 is an excellent deal for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners.</p>

There are too many bugs!!11!!!</em>"</p><p>I get it, and sometimes I feel that way, too. In fact, I care more about the software powering a product than the hardware, so it might even hit me a little harder. It seems like companies are getting worse and churning out products that are more buggy than ever.</p><p>They're not. You just know about them all, thanks to the information superhighway of the 'net.</p>
<p>It's good to be informed; there is no denying that. But sometimes, we can lose focus and fixate on the problems, even when we're not experiencing them. Whether it's old information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-weather-widget-desync-old-forecasts-reported">on a weather widget</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/some-galaxy-phone-screens-are-showing-a-nasty-green-line-after-an-update">magic green line</a> appearing on the screen after a software update, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">Bluetooth dropping</a> and then reconnecting every few minutes, you know all about it.</p><p>It has always been this way. There was a time before Reddit, before every tech website on the internet (including this one) rushed to write an article about a software bug, and phones still had them — lots and lots of them. Coming from BlackBerry, I <em>know</em> what lots of bugs look like.</p>

<p>This isn't a brand or operating system issue, either, because they all are like this. The iPhone and iOS are filled with bugs, just like Google's own Pixel phones are. Android on your Samsung or OnePlus phone is filled with bugs. Windows Phone was filled with bugs. Even Palm and Nokia phones were a mess.</p><p>You either didn't care or (more likely) you only knew about the ones you noticed. I've been writing about tech for a long time, so I probably get extra exposure to these issues, but I can tell you that there are plenty of reported and verified problems that I've never been able to see for myself.</p>
<p>This is the new normal. It's not even a bad thing. It can become a bad thing when unhelpful people who might be endeared to a particular brand a little too much chime in with things like <em>"I don't have the problem, so it must be user error, or you probably just need to restart your phone,</em>" nonsense that inevitably pops up in places like Reddit or article comments and forums.</p><p>It's important to know about potential problems, though. For instance, if you have a Pixel, you should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported" target="_blank">install a different alarm clock</a>. Do it before things happen.</p><p>We want to think of this as a new phenomenon. It's as if phone makers are purposefully releasing products early, knowing that the software is still a wreck, and they don't care. Just ship it!</p><p>That's probably partially true, but it has always been true. You probably never had the displeasure of using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/goodbye-blackberry">BlackBerry Storm</a>, but it was rushed to market when the first iPhone came out, and RIM (the company that was BlackBerry) eventually admitted to it. They wanted a big touchscreen phone on the market and did not care that it sucked.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="ukcG9WrVnudWXbkA7b9wQi" name="USB-debugging-generic.jpg" alt="Using adb" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukcG9WrVnudWXbkA7b9wQi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's just one example from the past, but there are plenty more from every phone maker. Most of the time, they eventually get it right; you just get to use an unfinished product for six months or so.</p><p>It's always going to be this way. Apple rushed its AI suite before it was ready. Samsung is doing everything it can to push <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">One UI 7</a> out and will "allow" more bugs than we want to make it happen. Google needs a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">refresher on processor throttling and power management</a> if it wants to keep designing chips.</p><p>We love to hate it, and sometimes hate to love it. But we need to get used to it. This isn't just a phone problem — everything you buy with a battery and a microprocessor is this way and will always be this way. And Reddit will have every person affected talking about it for you to read.</p>

And I'm basking in this sudden new trend of open-source watches as the big-name brands trend toward subscriptions.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unawatch/meet-una-the-modular-gps-sports-watch/description" target="_blank"><strong>UNA Watch Kickstarter</strong></a> lists out its features: continuous heart rate, blood oxygen, steps, and floors climbed in normal settings, plus fitness features like HR zones, pace, laps, and (after launch) downloadable GPX routes. It has dual-frequency GPS and 10-day battery life.</p><p>Interestingly, it runs on the same Cortex-M33 coprocessor found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, only without the battery-guzzling Snapdragon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:695px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="z79C4GMKNGhbyPUSBXujiK" name="UNA-Watch-with-app" alt="The UNA Watch on a wrist while the person's other hand holds an iPhone, showing a companion app with fitness data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z79C4GMKNGhbyPUSBXujiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="695" height="391" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UNA)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I appreciate that the UNA Watch charges with a simple USB-C slot <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-charging-is-an-unsolvable-mess">instead of a proprietary cable</a> and that you'll be able to buy modular upgrades like music storage or a mic/speaker combo and install them yourself. It also won't have any subscription.</p><p>You can even buy the dev tool for an extra $40 to add your own apps and firmware!</p><p>Pebble is much less fitness-focused, making UNA a better fit for my lifestyle. However, both share an open-source, enthusiast philosophy where people can code their own apps or add their own sensors as needed. In theory, the community will build up the UNA Watch's limited feature set — just as Pebble asked its community for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/how-to-help-build-open-source-pebble-software">help developing new software</a>.</p><p>My limited coding background makes it unlikely that I can help either community. But smartwatch brands have moved away from letting indie devs into their closed systems, to everyone's detriment. That's why devices like UNA and Pebble are so important and have me excited to buy into their communities.</p>
<h2 id="una-and-pebble-are-fighting-against-the-tide-2">UNA and Pebble are fighting against the tide</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K" name="pebble-core-duo-2-time-2-smartwatches-hero" alt="A rendering depicting Core Devices' new PebbleOS smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and the Time 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2037" height="1146" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've reviewed almost every mainstream smartwatch brand out there today, and it feels like they're all starting to converge on the same priorities.</p><p>Some wearable brands are honing in on offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">medical-grade health tracking</a> and adding new data points like blood pressure and glucose. Others, like Garmin, are going all-in on AI as a pretense to charge more for premium features with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect Plus subscription</a>.</p><p>Basically, we're entering the heavyweight era of smartwatches, where brands bring in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">doctors for more accurate data</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">squeeze LLMs onto your wrist</a>. And while that's exciting in its way, it doesn't leave much room for experimentation — for smaller brands, tiny teams, or indie devs to try something new — because every watch needs a laundry list of features to compete.</p><p>Part of that is Apple's fault. I've previously written about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/eu-dma-ruling-could-completely-reshape-fitness-smartwatch-industry">Apple's locked watch ecosystem forced wearable brands to focus on fitness</a> and how brands like Pebble today can't offer messaging, third-party app stores, or other smarts because of Apple's restrictions. Until the EU forces Apple to open up its ecosystem, that won't change (on iOS, at least).</p><p>That's why I'm considering dropping money on the UNA Watch or Pebble Watch, even though they're objectively less feature-packed than other watches on the market. To support brands that will go off the beaten industry path and try new things.</p>
<h2 id="more-modular-smartwatches-please-2">More modular smartwatches, please</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="ZVsDMLGiqToXa3vmEnufhK" name="UNA-Watch-lineup" alt="Three UNA Watch models with different strap colors in a row on a dark table, showing different data on each watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVsDMLGiqToXa3vmEnufhK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="680" height="382" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UNA)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've seen other "hackable" watches recently like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pocuter/spectra">Spectra</a> that count on their community to come up with exciting ideas. But the UNA Watch is especially intriguing to me, assuming it lives up to the brand's promises.</p><p>I appreciate that you can take out the battery and replace it yourself. A lot of wearable tech isn't repairable — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-battery-tech-only-partially-solves-smart-rings-bigger-problem">especially smart rings</a> — and when your watch naturally loses capacity, manufacturers would rather that you buy a new watch than keep your old device chugging along.</p><p>With the UNA Watch, you can unscrew everything yourself, either to replace things or add new features years later. Based on the Kickstarter comments, they'll choose what new modules to make based on what the community asks for, such as the mic/speaker for Bluetooth calling.</p><p>Pebble originally tried letting people add "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-straps-failed-for-reason-but-deserve-second-chance">smart straps</a>" to augment their watches after the fact. I feel like UNA follows that legacy, except that the modules will slot directly onto the watch itself. The question will be how <em>many</em> modules you'll be able to add.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unawatch/meet-una-the-modular-gps-sports-watch/rewards">UNA Watch Kickstarter</a> will take place until May 2, with plenty of early-bird deals available to save $75 on the eventual list price. It's expected to ship in August 2025. Meanwhile, if you're more interested in Pebble, its new watches are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.repebble.com/">available for preorder now</a>, with lower prices but a later scheduled release date of December 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eW3YVYPBj8kfJrwTwMX6qg" name="Google-cloud-mwc-sign.jpg" alt="Google Cloud at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eW3YVYPBj8kfJrwTwMX6qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll start with a short explainer for people who aren't in the U.S. and might wonder what all this fuss is about.</p><p>People coming illegally into the U.S. across the southern border is one of the most polarizing issues in the United States. Half the country hates it, and half of those people hate even the legal immigration of people from another culture. The other half knows it's a problem but hates the first half of the people enough to pretend it's not. Yeah, it's stupid, but it is what it is.</p><p>With that out of the way, here's what's happening and how Google is reportedly involved. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theintercept.com/2025/04/03/google-cbp-ai-border-surveillance-ibm-equitus/" target="_blank">The Intercept</a>, U.S. Customs and Border Protection plans to revamp some old surveillance towers around Tucson, Arizona.</p><p>They want to install equipment that will use AI to identify every person and vehicle that approaches the border. That's OK, and even my cheap-ass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/older-nest-cameras-are-getting-the-google-home-app-treatment">Nest camera</a> can do it. But — there's always a but — they want to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/asset-inspection" target="_blank">IBM's Maximo inspection software</a>, which is usually put in factory machines to do quality control inspections, to ferret out people with backpacks or otherwise look like they want to do some crimes or something.</p>
<p>Google (and Amazon, of course) is allegedly facilitating this by providing hosting services for data streams and tools to train AI. There is surely a lot of money involved, and Google is thirsty for it.</p><p>A few years ago, Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud CEO, said the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/google-cloud-ceo-kurian-to-employees-not-working-on-border-wall.html" target="_blank">wasn't going to do anything</a> to help create a "virtual border wall," but that was then, and this is now. Android Central has reached out to Google for a comment on its involvement with the project and will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>But let's be clear: Google is not providing any of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">its own AI tools</a> to make any of this happen, so even if it is involved, it's not directly being evil. It's just profiting from it.</p>
<h2 id="google-knows-better-2">Google knows better</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NrC6Bo4HMBSdf7qf7Qq52f" name="Google-cloud-mwc-sign-02.jpg" alt="Google Cloud at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrC6Bo4HMBSdf7qf7Qq52f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might be asking, "<em>Jerry, why is protecting the border something evil</em>?" It's <strong>not</strong>. It's 100% definitely not evil in any way, shape, or form. A country needs to be able to control how people come in and out and what they carry through. I'm not part of the half who hate the other half enough to hide my head in the sand.</p><p>But there is a right way and a wrong way. First, you can't dehumanize people who just want a better life. This is the biggest point of contention among the U.S. populace, and you have to admit the current political administration has said and done some pretty dehumanizing things.</p><p>Doing anything to help here is a bad PR move for any company, let alone one the size of Google. The optics of this are terrible, and most of the people working for Google and using its products aren't going to like it. Best of all, internet tech websites will make sure everyone knows about it; it's what we do best.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-probably-not-going-to-work-because-ai-2">It's probably not going to work, because AI</h2>
<p>The other issue is that Google knows this <strong>isn't going to work</strong> but is probably still salivating to get involved and collect a huge amount of taxpayer money for hosting services. Sure, it doesn't have to be responsible for the problems and directly do evil shit, but it gets to sit back and watch, pass Go, and collect their money.</p><p>AI can be trained to find people wearing backpacks. That's probably simple to do; tedious and time-consuming, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-record-label-partnerships-but-is-it-a-good-idea">training an AI</a> for this is possible right now.

<p>You aren't naive enough to think some bad stuff isn't going to happen to anyone targeted by an AI super-robo-border-camera. Google <em>definitely</em> isn't. Google uses AI to monitor YouTube (along with other things), and even that is a bona fide mess that Google can't control. If AI can't learn to spot what is copyright protected and what isn't, it's not good enough to do <em>anything</em> to a human being.</p><p>The best thing that could happen is that a truck filled with real human agents intercept the target. I won't speculate on the worst-case scenario. Still, bad guy will be caught. Innocent people will also be caught.</p><p>I wouldn't go hunting or backpacking around Tucson if I were you.</p>
<p>Assuming Google really is involved, it isn't really in the wrong and is simply fulfilling another government cloud hosting contract. It's just one that's tied to a deeply politically dividing issue, and the company should know better.</p><p>It would be the same if Google were to develop an online repository to help register and track every gun in America: half the country would go crazy, and the other half would say it's great. It's not great — it's stupid, and there are plenty of different ways to get that government money.</p>

Plus, they let users connect via Bluetooth, USB-C, or a 3.5mm headphone jack, though they do miss out on a few modern features like active noise cancellation. If those aren't dealbreakers for you, these are definitely worth considering compared to other competitors around this price.</p>

Beats also says they offer up to 50 hours of battery life per charge, and they'll charge to around 5 hours of playback in just 10 minutes or so. You can also get them in four colors: Cloud Pink, Black and Gold, Matte Black, and Slate Blue.</p><p>While the lack of ANC might make these a no-go for some, the audio quality, broad connectivity, and comfort make it a competitive pick, especially with this discount.</p>

The rumor started after Kaya allegedly discovered the feature while searching "Activity Launcher" in the latest OS beta. And when you search for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a> it will bring up its respective page full of feature details, as well as its list of supported Samsung apps.</p><p>However, it's important to note that users won't be able to see the feature in action in the beta version. The<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MEMETCAN88/status/1906790896261067217" target="_blank"> tipster further indicated that</a> Samsung has "disabled it," which could indicate more work is required before it can be seen.</p><p>Another user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1892878357009699231" target="_blank">Josh Guy</a>, backs this claim by stating that the Now Brief feature appeared on the Galaxy S24 in One UI 7 Beta 4. The user states that they had to do some "root level" digging to find "traces of code" to even access the core function, which seemingly indicates the Galaxy S24's ability to run Now Brief.</p><p>Samsung confirmed One UI 7 will <em>finally</em> arrive on April 10 in the U.S. However, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-schedule-galaxy-dates-spotted-overseas">fully detailed rollout schedule</a> was discovered on its Czech Republic website, giving us a good idea of what to expect.</p>

There's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-needs-apps-like-photoshop-to-succeed">Galaxy Tab S10 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>, which are big, powerful, and expensive offerings. This week, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE and Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus joined the club as smaller, less expensive options starting at $500.</p><p>But where's the base-model Galaxy Tab S10?</p><p>When Samsung neglected to release a new Galaxy Tab S10 alongside the Plus or Ultra models in October 2024, it was a bit puzzling. Without a regular Galaxy Tab S10, the lineup of newest Samsung tablets started at a $1,000 and a large 12.4-inch screen.</p><p>Now, it's even more odd that the South Korean tech giant is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">releasing two more Galaxy Tab S10 FE tablets</a> without making a standard-sized Galaxy Tab S10. It might seem like a small detail to harp on, but Samsung is still selling the Galaxy Tab S9 six months deep into the Galaxy Tab S10 series, which underscores why this is the company's most confusing tablet lineup yet.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-going-on-with-samsung-s-2025-tablet-lineup-2">What's going on with Samsung's 2025 tablet lineup?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung's core tablet lineup currently consists of five models: the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, Tab S10 Plus, Tab S9, Tab S10 FE Plus, and Tab S10 FE. The company actually sells more than that, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9 Plus, Tab S9 FE Plus, and Tab S9</a> still available for purchase. But for now, let's focus on the main five models, which are the newest in their respective product lines.</p><p>Of those five Galaxy tablet models, there are five different screen sizes, two different display types,  and three different processors made by three different chipmakers between them.</p><p>This kind of lineup structure leads to customer confusion. If you want the latest processor, you'll need to get the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus or Ultra, but that means you'll have to settle for a bigger screen.</p><p>If you prefer a smaller screen, you can't get a Galaxy Tab S10 tablet at all — you'll need to buy the Tab S9 with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a>. It performs better in some situations — and worse in others — than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a> in the Galaxy Tab S10 series. The Galaxy Tab S10 FE lineup adds a new processor into the mix, the Samsung Exynos 1580, which also powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A56</a>.</p>

<p>Since they're made by different companies and use different fabrication processes, it's hard to compare these three systems-on-a-chip to one another. On a larger scale, it's difficult to compare these tablets to one another despite all being Galaxy Tab products.</p><p>I suspect Samsung knows this because it conveniently leaves the chip name of each tablet off its respective spec sheet. Instead, it only lists its chips' core counts and clock speeds on the product pages for each of those five Galaxy Tab models. You'll have to dig much deeper to find out which processor powers which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet</a>, as it isn't easily available on the company's product pages.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-empty-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra - Empty Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display sizes present a similar avenue for customer frustration. The Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus has a larger, 13.1-inch LCD than the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus' 12.4-inch AMOLED. You'd think that all of Samsung's plus-sized tablets have similar form factors, but that isn't the case.</p>
<p>The lack of consistency across the five models makes the lineup's scalability poor. It's not easy to look at the Galaxy Tab S10 FE and decide to upgrade to a more premium model because the Galaxy Tab S9 is the natural upgrade path — but it sounds like a downgrade despite costing nearly double.</p><p>You can apply this general situation to comparisons between the two Galaxy Tab S10 models, the two Galaxy Tab S10 FE models, and the Galaxy Tab S9. There are so many differences that customers will feel overwhelmed, or simply won't be able to make an informed purchasing decision.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-and-against-a-base-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-2">The case for (and against) a base Samsung Galaxy Tab S10</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-in-hand.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Generative Edit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, do we even need a base-model Samsung Galaxy Tab S10? The answer is probably yes. Samsung introducing a Galaxy Tab S10 would immensely reduce confusion by eliminating the Tab S9 from the lineup, which is now the odd one out. It would also reduce the number of display types and processor models from three to two, and that's a big deal.</p><p>On the other hand, I could see the argument that the 10.9-inch Galaxy Tab S10 FE fills the hole left by the 11-inch Galaxy Tab S9 in the new lineup. Perhaps buyers of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> want bigger screens and only budget buyers like smaller ones.</p><p>One thing's for sure — the Samsung Galaxy Tab lineup is currently broken. Instead of adding two new Galaxy Tab S10 FE models to the party this week, perhaps Samsung should've given us a base model Galaxy Tab S10.</p>

<p>For me, the cover screen experience is one of the most important aspects of the modern <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a>. At first glance, it can seem gimmicky, but the external display is actually pretty useful and helps keep the phone pocketable. In fact, I find myself utilizing the cover screen more than not when I use a flip phone. That said, no cover screen experience is perfect, although one company does come close.</p><p>Motorola has pretty much set the standard on what a cover screen should be with its Razr smartphones, while Samsung has gone a different route with the external display on the Galaxy Z Flip line. Still, both offer fairly similar experiences on both devices, and both have their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>With that in mind, I decided to put them to the test to see which was the easiest to use without opening the phone. I would spend a whole day using <em>only</em> the cover screen on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p>

<p>Off the bat, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> was a bit frustrating. Even before I got started, I had to go through quite a bit of set up to make sure I could get what I needed out of the cover screen, and Samsung doesn't make it easy.</p><p>Getting set up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">use apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a> is a bit of a chore in itself. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-multistar-button">One UI 7</a> update makes things a little more accessible, Samsung still limits cover screen interactions (especially notifications) to the apps you have set to use on the cover screen.</p><p>Furthermore, you can add more apps from the cover screen; you have to open the phone to edit cover screen widgets and add more apps that you may need. This is why the setup took some time, as I had to ensure I had all the apps I knew I would use within a 24-hour time span.</p>

<p>After everything was said and done, using the cover screen throughout the day was a bit of a mixed bag on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Using the panels was a fine way to check the weather, control music, and perform other quick, glanceable tasks. The apps I set to work on the external display also worked mostly as expected on the smaller screen, although it did pose some challenges.</p><p>The somewhat small display made apps appear vertically scrunched, and some UI elements would awkwardly overlap. This would limit my view and even hide functions on apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> and Google Calendar, although they weren't unusable. However, the limitations of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen would hinder me in other ways.</p>

<p>The quick settings menu on the cover screen is a fixed set of eight toggles that you can't change. Many of these are options that are actually useful, but the fact that I can't add others is really annoying, especially since I can edit quick settings on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watch</a>.</p><p>I also can't just tap and hold the Bluetooth toggle to add a new device. I would have to open the Settings app (which you also can't access from the quick settings menu) and do it from there, which is pretty inconvenient.</p><p>Multitasking is also just not really a thing on the cover screen. If I open one app, I can't  open a Current Apps view to switch to another app. I would have to exit the app, swipe back to the Launcher panel, and then open the next app I was looking for. This becomes incredibly inconvenient when I need to copy something from one app and paste it into another.</p><p>Oh, and did I mention that even if you have Gboard as your default keyboard, you're stuck with Samsung Keyboard on the cover screen? Yeah, that's a no from me, dawg.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 failed the experiment. The experience was just too cumbersome with the limitations when multitasking, interacting with notifications, or trying to perform certain tasks that would require me to open the phone.</p>

<p>Things were a bit different with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, and while I was able to get through an entire day without opening the phone, the experience highlighted some of the shortcomings of the Razr cover screen.</p><p>Unlike the Galaxy Z Flip, I didn't have to go through any lengthy setup to get the cover screen ready. There were no apps to download to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">get my apps to work on the Razr cover screen</a>. I just enabled the app widget, tapped the pencil icon on the cover screen, and chose what apps I wanted or didn't want. I could always add or remove apps whenever I wanted without opening the phone.</p><p>Just like with the Galaxy Z Flip, Motorola also has a host of panels for quick access to weather, contacts, games, and even widgets. The home screen also lets me set four app shortcuts for your most used apps, which is pretty handy and saves me from having to swipe over to the app screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4175px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-14.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4175" height="2348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as how apps work, it's pretty similar to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, although the larger cover screen means apps have more room to stretch. This keeps the app's own UI elements from blocking other parts of the app, although it also highlights another problem with Motorola's implementation: the cameras.</p><p>Because the dual camera system is set within the bottom right corner of the display, the sensors often block certain aspects of the UI. This is mostly a problem with text fields where buttons like Send are usually set to the bottom right side.</p><p>Fortunately, you can press and hold the bottom navigation bar to shift the bottom of the app UI up. It scrunches the app a bit, but you'll have full view of the parts covered by the camera, then you can press and hold it again to bring back the full screen view. It's not a huge issue, but it can feel cumbersome to do this constantly. Still, it shows Motorola thought hard about how to get the most out of the external display.</p>

<p>Social media apps like Instagram are also awkward to view on the Razr. Watching Reels or Stories will often just show a zoomed-in section of the video instead of a full view. The only time you can see the full view of Story is if you're watching your own, which is an odd behavior.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3y2gqgQXwrfKbCuJyG3Xqn" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-cover-screen-1" alt="Instagram on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3y2gqgQXwrfKbCuJyG3Xqn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3807" height="2141" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from that, most apps behave and function as expected, which is refreshing. I can even multitask with a Current Apps view, which is <em>extremely</em> useful, and using the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen, which doesn't have one, made me realize how much I rely on it. That also goes for the quick settings menu, which is much more robust on the Razr Plus and lets me have as many as 15 toggles that I unfortunately can't edit.</p><p>The downside is that Motorola doesn't allow me to open the Settings app from the cover screen, which is a weird omission. The Bluetooth toggle is also somewhat limited, letting me connect to previous devices but not pair with new ones. Fortunately, I didn't find myself needing to set up new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the Razr Plus cover screen plays nicely with Google Services. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is usable from the cover screen, but tapping a payment terminal won't pull up any sort of UI for visual confirmation, something the Razr will do.</p><p>I also cannot utilize 2FA on the Galaxy cover screen when signing into a Google account. It will just pull up a notification that I can't interact with, whereas the confirmation screen will appear on the Razr so I can tap <strong>Yes</strong>. I do this quite often, so it's an annoying limitation on the Z Flip.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-cover-screen" alt="YouTube Music on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are few reasons why you'll want to use just the cover screen on these phones, unless you find the main display broken or unusable for some reason. However, the experience really highlights how they're different and where their strengths and weaknesses lie.</p><p>It's clear the Razr Plus 2024 has a better cover screen, but Motorola should continue to optimize it with future updates. A Settings app would be nice, for example, and it would be cool to view vertical videos on social media apps in their entirety instead of just a partial view.</p><p>Samsung needs to revamp its cover screen experience, starting with eliminating the MultiStar requirement to use third-party apps. That would be a major step to improving the phone and would definitely help me consider making the Galaxy Z Flip my primary phone over the Razr.</p><p>Still, both the Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 are great phones, and even well into 2025, they remain two of the best flip phones on the market. That is until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr Plus 2025</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> arrive, both of which could bring welcome improvements to the cover screen.</p>

<hr>
<p>We've been seeing several Motorola Razr 2025 series leaks pop up lately, considering the duo could be nearing launch sometime this month (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-60-ultra-early-database-certification-spotted">rumors</a>). The most recent leak shows off the Motorola Razr 2025 and the Razr Plus 2025 in all its hues and angles. Additionally, we have details on possible specs that this duo could launch with.</p><p>Starting with the Motorola Razr Plus 2025, prominent tipster Evan Blass took to X to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1907512687237415340">post a 30-second teaser</a> of the device, which looks a lot like the official teaser from the company itself. The video shows off the phone in all the rumored colorways, including the new Red, dark green faux leather, and the wood finish models.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-motorola-razr-60-60-ultra-renders-specs-leak/">news site YTechB</a>, the colors will be called Pantone Scarab, Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret.</p><p>Additionally, Blass shared a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1907512689611649306">thread of images of the Razr Plus 2025</a> showing the device from multiple angles, along with the images of the cover screen and the rumored action button on the left side. Furthermore, they posted another image indicating that this year's Plus model will come packed with additional<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai#section-moto-ai-features"> Moto AI </a>features.</p>

<p>As for the specs, the material posted by Blass all but confirms previous rumors that the Plus model will be powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, much like some of today's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones"> best Android phones</a>, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series and the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13"> OnePlus 13.</a></p><p>Other rumors indicate that the device could pack a dual-cell 4,275mAh battery (possibly 4,500mAh), up from 4,000mAh, plus faster 68W charging. While the design stays similar to the 2024 model, the cameras get a level up with dual 50MP rear cameras and a 50MP selfie shooter as well.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2025 will reportedly have 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options, along with 8GB, 12GB, and 16GB RAM options, although it's not sure which configurations will be available in international markets or North America.</p>

<p>It wasn't only the Plus model that saw some massive leaks. Official-looking renders of the alleged 2025 standard Razr also showed up on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-motorola-razr-60-60-ultra-renders-specs-leak/">YTechB</a>. According to the publication, Motorola will launch the Razr 2025 in three shades: Pantone Gibraltar Sea(deep blue), Pantone Lightest Sky (silver), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/alleged-moto-razr-2025-shows-up-in-green-colorway">Spring Bug </a>(green), aligning with the previous rumors.</p><p>When it comes to design, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-razr-plus-2025-leaked-specs">recent leak</a> indicated that the phone could see a smaller 6.7-inch screen when compared to the 6.9-inch on the 2024 model. However, it seems like the company is sticking to the 6.9-inch foldable LTPO AMOLED display this year, according to YTechB. It will be powered by the new MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chip and 12GB of RAM.</p>

<p>While these leaks give away so many details about the clamshell duo, they must still be taken with caution. Motorola is yet to reveal its next flagship foldable and we expect that to happen sometime very soon. But while you wait, here's what we expect to see from this year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025#section-motorola-razr-plus-2025-design-display">Motorola Razr 2025 series.</a></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Although Amazon's Big Spring Sale is over, there are still a few leftover phone and tablet deals remaining. One such deal includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank"><strong>$120 OFF the Google Pixel Tablet at Amazon</strong></a>, nearly bringing this mid-range device back to its lowest price ever.</p><p>This deal is for the Pixel Tablet with 128GB of storage, and while it certainly isn't a premium-level device, it's plenty for most casual users and those with Google Home ecosystems. It also comes with 8GB of RAM, an 11-inch screen, and the user-friendly Pixel UI that many users like. While it probably isn't powerful enough for most hardcore gaming, it boasts the ability to multitask, manage smart home devices, and utilize Google AI features, along with quick compatibility with other Pixel devices. It's also worth noting that Google will be ending software updates for the Pixel Tablet next summer, though that might not be a big deal for some.</p>

This entry-level tablet is nothing too crazy, but it offers straightforward compatibility with other Pixel devices, Google smart home commands, Chromecast, and more, and it normally has a sticker price of $400.</p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-tablet-11-android-tablet-128gb-wifi-porcelain/6578701.p?skuId=6578701" target="_blank">Best Buy - $279.00</a> | <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_tablet" target="_blank">Google - $279.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="622fce8b-2e21-4111-b82d-06120b2ad394" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Tablet (128GB):" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Tablet (128GB):" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're a fan of the Google-Android UI interface and/or you have other devices within the Pixel ecosystem; you need a low-cost, user-friendly tablet; you want a device that will let you utilize multi-tasking or control smart home devices.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a tablet that includes many years of Android updates; you want a device that's powerful enough for gaming.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> is highly considered a great device by those who like the Pixel ecosystem, and by those who are more casual tablet users.  It features a good-looking 11-inch screen, 8GB of RAM, Google AI features, and a simple user-friendly interface with the Pixel design language. You can get it in either 128GB or 256GB storage configurations, and in either Porcelain or Hazel colors.</p><p>Arguably the biggest downside to this tablet is Google's decision to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet/i-dont-want-the-pixel-tablet-to-die"> stop deploying updates for the Pixel tablet</a> next summer, but if that doesn't bother you, then this could be a solid pick while it's under $300.</p>

<ul><li>With a day to spare, TikTok avoids another ban in the U.S. after President Trump granted the platform an extension.</li><li>This is the second extension TikTok has received, with the first one set to expire April 5 before this last-minute reprieve.</li><li>A U.S. law originally set a deadline of Jan. 19 for the sale of TikTok U.S. or a nationwide ban, which has now been extended twice.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TikTok will remain available for at least 75 more days as President Donald Trump extended the deadline requiring TikTok's sale of U.S. operations, he announced Friday, April 4 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114280893859636366" target="_blank">Truth Social</a>. This is the second time Trump has granted TikTok an extension, the first of which was set to expire on April 5 if the company did not reach a deal to divest its U.S. business.</p><p>TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">apprehensive toward the idea of a divestiture</a> in the past. TikTok previously went offline for a brief period starting Jan. 19, 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">but service was quickly restored.</a> The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title15/chapter123&edition=prelim" target="_blank">law banning TikTok</a> requires that any extensions made would require at least a path to the divestiture of TikTok U.S.</p><p>Statements from Trump and ByteDance spokespersons suggest that there could be a path to divestiture and a final resolution to this saga involving the world's most popular social media site.</p><p>"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress," Trump wrote in the Truth Social post. "The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."</p>

<p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/trumps-extends-tiktok-second-time.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, a ByteDance spokesperson said that "an agreement has not been executed" and that "there are key matters to be resolved."</p><p>ByteDance appears to be working with the U.S. government to reach a divestiture agreement, which would need to be approved by the Chinese government. Another key part of the deal is the tariff situation between the U.S. and China, which President Trump specifically called out in his post announcing the extension.</p><p>"We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between China and the U.S.A.!)," Trump added. "This proves that Tariffs are the most powerful Economic tool, and very important to our National Security!"</p><p>Months after the original TikTok ban was set to take effect as required by law, the social media platform has received another extension. That means users in the U.S. won't have to worry about the app shutting down or being <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-is-back-but-android-users-never-missed-out-in-the-first-place">unavailable for download in the region</a>.</p><p>"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark,'" Trump wrote.</p>

<hr>
<p>After staying mostly silent, rumors now claim to have discovered Samsung's next rugged smartphone.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-xvoer-7-specs">Android Headlines</a> claims users should look out for the Korean OEM's next XCover, the Galaxy XCover 7 Pro. Staying tough and durable throughout all kinds of weather and situations is the highlight of the XCover series, and that will seemingly continue. The publication purports the device will sport the U.S. military's MIL-STD-810H endurance standard.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung may provide it with an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance.</p><p>The next rugged phone may feature a 4,350mAh battery alongside 15W wired fast charging. This is rumored to power its 6.6-inch LCD, which has remained consistent over the XCover 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-announcement">the XCover 6 Pro</a>. While you wouldn't wow yourself with Samsung's rugged series cameras, the post suggests it could grab a 50MP primary lens and an 8MP ultrawide.</p><p>The selfie camera is reportedly 13MP, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">One UI 7</a> expected under the hood of it all.</p><p>The publication also purports the phone's starting price, which is supposedly €599 (~$654). Rumors claim the phone could launch in Europe "this month." There's no word yet about a global launch or at least one for U.S. consumers.</p>

<p>Some extremely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-next-gen-pro-rugged-devices-early-leak">early XCover leaks</a> surfaced in October, claiming Samsung was working on two Pro model devices. Those rumors said the company was developing a new XCover phone <em>and </em>tablet. The former was spotted with the model number SM-G766B; however, speculation said this would arrive as the "XCover 8 Pro." This assumption was based on Samsung's history in which the "Pro" version was always one number (generation) higher.</p><p>Strangely, Samsung might switch things up, as the current line of rumors purport the opposite.</p><p>Rumors continued two months later in December as the XCover 7 Pro (or 8 Pro) appeared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-next-pro-rugged-phone-battery-certification">SafetyKorea database</a>. Information remained light, but it gave us a look at its potential battery capacity: 4,350mAh. This lines up with the current line of rumors, so perhaps we could see this. Once again, it looks like Samsung will make its battery removeable, a common occurrence for the XCover phone.</p><p>Tipsters claimed the phone could launch in mid-2025.</p>

<p>YouTube is preparing users on its platform for a series of new features that should make the Shorts creation process worry-free.</p><p>The platform highlighted a handful of Shorts creation tools set to arrive "this spring" in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-creation-tools-youtube-shorts-2025/">blog post</a>. The bulk of these features concern the editing and final touch process of making Shorts. YouTube states users will soon notice a "new and improved" video editor in the app. The post states the platform is finally listening to user feedback by improving the ability for users to make "precise" edits for clips and specific times.</p><p>Users will have the ability to zoom in or snap in clips when attempting to strike the perfect timing. Moreover, the editor brings clip rearranging and deletion options "to create a rough cut," with timed text and music capabilities.</p><p>Regarding music, the editor will let content creators sync their Shorts clips with a chosen song. YouTube says this process happens "automatically" after selecting what song you'd like. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-longer-content-template-details">Templates</a>, which debuted last year, are receiving an update that lets users grab pictures from their phone's gallery and use them in Shorts.</p>

<p>Stickers in Shorts are receiving two updates this spring: one with AI and another that incorporates them into your videos. For the former, YouTube states its experimental AI software only requires a text description from users to create a sticker. The final update lets users take those newly created stickers and pop them into their Short.</p><p>YouTube has been slowly adding tools and features for content creation on its platform, but its AI is all wrapped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">in the Inspirational tab</a>. During its Made by YouTube event, the platform highlighted the new tab, which houses its AI tools for video creation, like the one for video generation. Users can "create a video" using text descriptions with its experimental AI that leverages Veo for six-second clips for Shorts.</p><p>YouTube's upcoming AI sticker generator will almost certainly fall into this Inspirational tab for users in the spring.</p><p>Elsewhere, the platform started testing its new AI-based remix option called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-song-restyle-ai-remix-test-spotted">Restyle</a>." Leveraging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-watermarks-for-ai-generated-music">Dream Track</a>, users can pick from a few official, liscenced songs and turn them into something new. Restyling will provide users with a 30-second clip that they can use as background music for their Shorts.</p>

<ul><li>A report suggests Meta's Llama 4 has encountered a series of internal and external issues, forcing it into multiple delays.</li><li>Sources claim the company experienced increased pressure to do more with its machine learning following DeepSeek's startling arrival.</li><li>Meta is also looking to improve the AI's performance, reasoning, and math skills as it chases an alleged launch "later this month."</li><li>Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg teased Llama 4's 2025 launch last fall; however, the company also announced LlamaCon for April 29.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A report claims the next iteration of Meta's LLM is still on the way, though it has run into a few roadblocks.</p><p>According to "people familiar with the matter," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-nears-release-new-ai-model-performance-hiccups?offer=rtsu-engagement-25">The Information</a> (paywall) claims Meta's Llama 4 model has run into issues that have severely hindered its progress. Allegedly, one of the problems Meta ran into was with its competition, namely the Chinese-based AI model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a>. The publication states these "challenges" concerned the performance of this new competitor and the "additional pressure" to "push the ball forward" with its upcoming AI model.</p><p>Sources allege Meta's Llama 4 model will "borrow" from DeepSeek's machine-learning approach by deploying a new method called "mixture of experts."</p><p>The post states this new method will split up the AI's training, focusing on separate parts so each becomes "an expert" in its own regard. This could impact the AI on a more technical and, perhaps, hardware level, as Meta wouldn't need to force the entirety of Llama 4 to activate just for one task.</p><p>Elsewhere, sources claim Meta's Llama 4 "didn't perform well" during its internal benchmark tests. Its ability to process math and the AI's reasoning skills were reportedly the hardest hit areas. As Meta chases the title of best artificial intelligence, another area Llama 4 struggled with was conversations. The company allegedly wants Llama 4 to feel more "humanlike" when engaging with voice — which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-trying-to-steal-scarlett-johanssons-voice-to-make-ai-feel-comfortable-is-the-reason-why-its-so-worrying">exactly what OpenAI did</a>, creating a surge of terrified responses.</p>

<p>Despite all the (reported) internal uncertainty of Llama 4, the publication purports the model is "aiming to release later this month."</p><p>We've been expecting Meta's Llama 4 for a while, ever since the company's CEO Mark Zuckerbeerg <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q3-2024-earnings">teased its upcoming launch</a> last fall. During its Q3 2024 earnings call, Zuckerberg stated Llama 4 is "expected" to launch in 2025 with improved capabilities. He highlighted that more users have utilized its AI model through Meta AI in places like Facebook, WhatsApp, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses</a>. However, the Information cites its alleged sources, stating the company could look to bring Llama 4 to business customers "more effectively."</p><p>Zuckerberg adds Llama 4 is expected to be "much faster" when it (hopefully) launches this year.</p><p>Also, Meta announced in February that it plans to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-announces-connect-2025-and-first-llamacon">LlamaCon</a>, a new developer event for those building with Llama, on April 29. The company said it plans to share "the latest on our open source AI developments" to help those developers build apps and products. Meta intends to spend roughly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">$65 billion on AI</a> this year, so the pressure is definitely on as it continues to develop the next LLM.</p><p>With rumors suggesting a Llama 4 launch "this month," perhaps it'll line up with LlamaCon — but we'll have to wait and see.</p>

The 40-minute show debuted 23 new games and updates, and it was a delight for indie game lovers.</p><p>This one comes hot on the heels of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/march-2025-vr-games-showcase-highlights">VR Gaming Showcase</a>, meaning there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> for you to look forward to this year. In fact, a ton of games came out just this week, including Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate, Ghost Town, Stay: Forever Home, and Pinball FX VR. If you're ready for the next batch of excitement, though, check out the full show on YouTube and read my highlights below.</p>

<h2 id="the-2025-ruff-talk-vr-gaming-showcase-2">The 2025 Ruff Talk VR Gaming Showcase</h2>

<p>The full 40-minute showcase can be watched above.</p>
<h2 id="vestiges-fallen-tribes-2">Vestiges: Fallen Tribes</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UZr4v-PAK5M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Wanadev Studio continues to flex its creative muscles with Vestiges: Fallen Tribes, a new take on the interactive board game concept. It's set in a unique sci-fi universe that blends the tribal desert style of Dune with the card-battling minifigure concepts in Demeo. After Ragnarock and the Propagation series, it's hard to think of a more different type of game for the team to tackle.</p><p>Like Demeo, Vestiges: Fallen Tribes is playable in VR and on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2511780/Vestiges_Fallen_Tribes/">desktop PC via Steam</a>, giving its gameplay a wide range of players and styles. Unlike Demeo, you control several units at a time, powering your army with a stack of cards that give them powers.</p><p>In addition to a seriously fantastic art style and fascinating universe, the game supports both PvP and PvE modes. That solo campaign features "dozens of missions, diverse objectives, and three playable tribes with distinct playstyles, offering players countless hours of strategy-based gameplay."</p><p>Expect the game to launch on April 24 on the Meta Quest platform.</p>
<h2 id="silent-north-2">Silent North</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Crh_NM4ZMjc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The developer behind Ghosts of Tabor is back with another banger, this time set in the snowy landscape of the Swiss Alps. What once was a picturesque landscape is now dotted with waves of the undead. Combat Waffle Studios might have popularized survival extraction games in VR, but Silent North is here to redefine the concept with its PvPvE gameplay.</p><p>You'll need to visit villages and scavenge as many items as you can. Anything from clothes to food, guns, ammo, bandages, or even scrap can be used to aid your survival in the harsh wilderness. Not only are the zombies after you, though, but so are the players. Team up with humans or take them down and take their stuff. The choice is yours.</p><p>Silent North can be preordered now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/silent-north/6245697225519539/">on the Meta Quest platform</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440750/Silent_North/">on Steam</a> with a special preorder discount.</p>
<h2 id="exer-gale-2">Exer Gale</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12-MKHOfh-0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Pilotwings is a series that's seriously underappreciated by Nintendo. Developer Chark is making up for that by giving us a game that lets us fly freely and land softly in VR, all with a simple control scheme that makes flying easy for anyone. Just spread your wings (arms), and you'll naturally glide through the skies, racing other players or challenging yourself to top the leaderboards.</p><p>Like many of the most popular Meta Quest games, Exer Gale aims to be a social landing point that eschews complicated controls for pure fun. The developers said the game has been in development for years, primarily targeted as a single-player release with multiplayer to follow, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">changes in the VR landscape</a> have them reworking things to be multiplayer-centric on release.</p><p>Early access begins in June, so wishlist the game now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/exer-gale/8008532059164602/">Meta Quest</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2078200/Exer_Gale/">Steam</a> platforms to get notified when it's available.</p>
<h2 id="disembodied-2">Disembodied</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcmQ01399JU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>As a fan of the weirdest games available — Katamari Damacy is among my all-time favorites, for example — Disembodied immediately caught my attention. You use your hands to control a disembodied pair of hands with the goal of hopping and grabbing your way through this mixed reality 3D platformer.</p><p>Seeing your hands tethered together and walking on their own is a crazy enough experience, but that feeling gets even weirder when you start grabbing objects and tossing them across the level. It's an incredible bit of innovation that I'd love to see more of, and it's easily one of my most anticipated upcoming VR games.</p><p>Disembodied is coming to Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets "at some point," hopefully this year.</p>
<h2 id="loop-one-done-2">Loop One Done</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBeBi-JYBGo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I've never really been interested in games like Factorio because they require a lot of calculation and far more time sitting in front of a screen than I want to do, but Loop One Done's physical interactions make this concept a lot more appealing to me.</p><p>You'll start by sending a drone to mine materials, guided entirely by your hand. That loop is then recorded and repeated forever, allowing you to focus on the next piece of the puzzle.</p><p>Directly interacting with your factory pieces and drones evokes a very "toy-like" quality that immediately gets me interested. This isn't just sorting through a visual spreadsheet of machines; it's actually placing the machines down, physically moving them, and even recording manual drone movements to make things happen.</p><p>The developer says he's been making the game for the last four years as it's evolved from a drone delivery game to a massive mixed reality factory automation game. It supports controllers and hand tracking, plus there's a miniature mode that makes it easy for players of any height to enjoy. Look for it to launch on the Meta Quest platform in early access on May 2.</p>
<h2 id="the-phoenix-gene-2">The Phoenix Gene</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2MQf5iUJy38" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Many years ago, Sega promised us a Panzer Dragoon VR game. While that never materialized, The Phoenix Gene seems to have risen from the ashes and thrown a little bit of Rez in for good measure. As a <strong>huge</strong> fan of the Panzer Dragoon series, I'm always excited whenever I can play a new release, and the VR motion controls for The Phoenix Gene look like the perfect way to take the concept into the 2020s.</p><p>The developers describe controlling your phoenix as "like holding a paper plane." You'll move it around with your controllers, ducking, diving, and shooting your way through the game's colorful levels.</p><p>What particularly intrigues me is the ability to shoot 360 degrees around you at any time just by moving. The Panzer Dragoon games allowed you to swivel the camera in 90-degree segments but it was always a bit harrowing trying to multitask between different directions. This seems to solve that problem entirely, thanks to natural hand and head movement. You can wishlist the game now on Meta Quest with a release date of some time this year.</p>

<p>VR exercise games are a dime a dozen these days, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/underdogs-meta-quest">some games are hidden workout gems</a>, Pedal Rebel VR aims to turn that dusty exercise bike in your closet into a sweat-covered machine in no time. Strap a controller to either of your legs and get pedaling in this neon-soaked, 80s-flavored, fast-paced racer with a twist!</p><p>Instead of biking the serene countryside, as some other VR biking games have you doing, Pedal Rebel VR gets you rip-roaring down a highway at breakneck speeds, weaving through and dodging traffic to get high scores. It's a great twist on the concept of exercising at home, and it does something unlike we've seen before in VR.</p><p>Hit up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pedalrebelvr.com/">the official website</a> and join the Discord for a demo!</p>

Previously, the carrier made headlines by selling the phone for $5 per month when you signed up for the Unlimited Ultimate plan, and this deal is even better.

<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is easily one of the most powerful <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> on the market today. Unfortunately, it's also quite expensive, which is why I was stoked to see Verizon give it away for FREE when you add a line with the Unlimited Ultimate plan.

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is peak Android technology, coming complete with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a stunning 6.9-inch AMOLED display with built-in stylus, and all of the AI-boosted software features that you could ever want in a phone. Like the rest of the S25 series, you&apos;ll also be guaranteed to receive seven years of OS/security updates straight out of the box, and the upgraded camera system is one of the best we&apos;ve ever used. </p><p>Verizon&apos;s Unlimited Ultimate plan is equally impressive, giving users unlimited talk, text, and data on the carrier&apos;s 5G Ultra Wideband network, international coverage in over 210 countries, and 60GB of premium mobile hotspot every single month. The plan starts at $90 per month for a single line, but you can drop that price down considerably by taking advantage of multiline discounts or other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a>. </p>

<p>About a year from now, you'll probably start seeing headlines talking about "the end of the Pixel Tablet." That's because, as of June 2026, Google will no longer be releasing regular Android updates for its only "current" tablet. Instead, it will only receive security updates until those come to an end in 2028.</p><p>Late last year, rumors were ramping up that Google was working on at least one successor, possibly two. But it didn't take long for those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-future-pixel-tablet-cancellation-rumors">rumors to get squashed</a>, leaving only the slimmest of hopes for a surprise. Unfortunately, that surprise has yet to be revealed, and since we haven't heard anything by now, it's <em>probably</em> safe to say that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google's latest tablet</a> experience is over.</p>

<h2 id="the-pixel-tablet-keeps-getting-left-out-2">The Pixel Tablet keeps getting left out</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QYMwvjLPKzPEPmp8v7Wq9H" name="google-pixel-tablet-review-pixel-7-pro.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QYMwvjLPKzPEPmp8v7Wq9H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few things that don't make any sense about Google's handling of the Pixel Tablet. First, I don't understand why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Pixel 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">7 Pro</a> will see OS updates until 2027. All three devices are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g2">Tensor G2</a>, while the Pixel 7 and Tablet both include 8GB of RAM. So if Google claims it's a hardware limitation, there's a pretty good chance it's blowing smoke.</p><p>Google changed its plans in December 2024 when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-confirms-the-pixel-6-pixel-7-and-pixel-fold-will-get-two-extra-android-os-upgrades">extended software updates</a> for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series by another two years. But nowhere in that announcement did Google have anything to say about the Tablet, almost as if it forgot that it even exists.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, the Pixel Tablet isn't perfect, but I like to think that it helped Google hone in on improving the Android experience on larger screens. If it weren't for the Pixel Tablet, there's a good chance that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everyone-was-wrong-about-the-og-pixel-fold">Pixel Fold</a> could've been a complete failure, resulting in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> being shelved.</p><p>That's probably just me overthinking things a bit, but it's also not outside the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>I also understand that the Pixel Tablet can't take advantage of everything that Gemini has to offer. This is a big reason why I thought we would've seen a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2">Pixel Tablet 2</a> by now. Gemini has continued to improve, and it's finally reached the point that it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-switch-from-google-assistant-to-gemini-might-kill-nest-speakers-and-displays">replacing Assistant</a> for good. And while you can use the Gemini app, practically none of its features will be performed locally on the Tablet, instead relying on the cloud.</p><p>Missing out on the full capabilities of Gemini might not seem like all that big of a deal, but there's still an unaddressed elephant in the room that Google continues to ignore — the Pixel Tablet is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-is-just-teasing-us-now-android-15-pixel-tablet">better Nest Hub Max</a>.</p>

<p>This is why I don't want the Pixel Tablet to die yet. I mostly keep mine on the Charging Speaker Dock, as it's more responsive than either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">Nest Hub Max in my kitchen</a> or the Nest Hub in my living room when I need to control my smart home. Plus, Hub Mode turns the Tablet into the hub for my smart home, putting all of the controls right on the screen and within arm's reach at my desk.</p><p>Again, I know that things won't just stop working even when Google stops sending security patches. But I'm not quite sure how I feel about letting the Pixel Tablet continue controlling my smart home when it's not as up-to-date or secure as it could be (granted, 2028 is still a while off). And like I said before, it's been better for me than the Nest Hub Max, so why would I want a downgraded experience?</p>

<p>I've taken a cursory glance at custom ROMs, just to get a basic idea of what might be available come this time next year. So far, I've found <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://e.foundation/e-os/">/e/OS</a>, but I still have more research to do before coming to any kind of decision. I mean, I don't want to go through the headache of dusting off my rooting skills just to find that the dock doesn't work or that there's some other feature that's missing. But that's for future me to worry about.</p><p>Ultimately, I would just love for Google to solve this problem for me by releasing either a new Pixel Tablet or Nest Hub Max. Or, it could do something it's never done and release an update that turns the former into the latter for good. Even if that means shipping the dumbed-down interface found on Google's smart displays, it would still be better than not having the Pixel Tablet at all.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="63xNAdwbFLnE9PYhFByPXS" name="made-by-google-pixel-8-event-ns-50.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G3 hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/63xNAdwbFLnE9PYhFByPXS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this rate, I'd settle for a refreshed Pixel Tablet, with the only change being an upgraded chip for the sake of longer software support. It doesn't even have to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, as the Tensor G3-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a> will receive updates until October 2030.</p><p>Do I think any of this is going to happen? Nope. But if something were to happen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">I/O 2025</a> is right around the corner, and that's probably when some type of announcement would be made.</p><p>I'm just keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best. Maybe putting this out into the ethos will result in getting what I want. It's already happened with Chromebooks, as I wrote about the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/where-have-all-the-chromebooks-gone">slow demise</a>" of the platform, only for MediaTek to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-kompanio-ultra-next-gen-chromebook-plus-announced">announce</a> a brand new chip. C'mon Google, make a liar out of me, please.</p>

Over the past eight years, many Android and x86 gaming handhelds offer more than enough horsepower to emulate even the most graphically intensive Switch games thanks to the likes of Ryujinx and Yuzu. But after years of mostly being quiet, Nintendo went on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">DMCA spree</a> last year, taking down the best Switch emulators, and now we know why.</p><p>Following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, the company published a series of articles and videos titled "Ask the Developers." As it turns out, Nintendo is doing the exact thing that it's trying to stop everyone else from doing — well, not <em>exactly</em> the same thing, but pretty darn close.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7KpJHS5PoZ8nqGpw836PSX" name="multiple-emulators-on-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg-z-fold-6-1" alt="Emulation on Android devices with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AYANEO Pocket DMG, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7KpJHS5PoZ8nqGpw836PSX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" target="_blank">one of the interviews</a> published, Nintendo's Kouichi Kawamoto and Takuirho Dohta were asked about backward compatibility with original Switch games. This might seem like an odd question, but it's because the Switch 2 is reliant upon a completely different architecture compared to its predecessor. As a result, it's not exactly as simple as taking your original Breath of the Wild cartridge, putting it in the Switch 2, and start playing.</p><p>When asked, "Does that mean the Switch and Switch 2 aren't compatible at a hardware level?" Dohta responded, "If we tried to use technology like software emulators, we'd have to run Switch 2 at full capacity, but that would mean the battery wouldn't last so long, so we did something that’s somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1138px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="QJVgRX5kQX5N2jStmDrrCf" name="nintendo-switch-2-and-nintendo-switch-gameplay-promo-render" alt="One person playing the Nintendo Switch, with the other playing with a Switch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QJVgRX5kQX5N2jStmDrrCf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1138" height="640" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reading between the lines a bit, it sounds to me like Nintendo wanted to just use an emulator to run Switch 1 games on the Switch 2. However, there isn't enough power in the upcoming NVIDIA chip to allow for that without severely sacrificing battery life. It's a common problem with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android and x86 handhelds</a> as newer consoles just chew through battery like there's no tomorrow.</p><p>To combat this problem, Nintendo took a slightly different approach, introducing something like a translation layer to relieve some of the pressure. This isn't unheard of, as Apple's M-series processors rely on Rosetta, and just last year, Microsoft introduced its Prism layer to accompany the Snapdragon Arm chips found in the latest Surface Laptop and Surface Pro models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="XsWQwguCiVAwk7xL4Atjm3" name="macbook-pro-14-microsoft-surface-pro-11-windows-central.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro 14 next to Surface Pro 11 on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XsWQwguCiVAwk7xL4Atjm3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, there's another layer (pun intended) to how we're going to be able to play Switch 2 games, and I have a feeling it's Nintendo's way of trying to prevent, or at least slow down, Switch 2 emulation.</p><p>Currently, when you buy a physical Switch game, all of the game data and information is held on that cartridge. Slot it into your Switch, and it might need to install an update, but generally, you can just start playing.</p><p>For certain Switch 2 games, that won't be the case, as the physical cartridge is nothing more than a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-game-key-card-overview">Game Key Card</a>." This means that you'll spend your hard-earned money, put the Game Cart into your Switch 2, and then wait until the game is actually downloaded from the cloud. It's sure to be a frustrating solution for some, but it's practically identical to what we've dealt with on Xbox and PlayStation consoles for years.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:940px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="UUyqBJfDRVjRFW36N8Y9Bf" name="nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-graphic" alt="Game Key Card label on upcoming Switch 2 physical cartridge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UUyqBJfDRVjRFW36N8Y9Bf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="940" height="529" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Opting for this Game Key Card method isn't solely an attempt to curb emulation. There are other reasons, too, as the Switch 2 cartridges are limited to a 64GB capacity. This is double the amount of the original Switch, but still might not be enough, which helps explain why the Switch 2 features 256GB of built-in storage, compared to the 8GB from the original.</p><p>With that in mind, it will be interesting to see what, if anything, comes to Switch 2 emulation on non-Nintendo hardware like Android handhelds.</p><p>Now that the cat's out of the bag, Nintendo's warpath on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulators </a>makes a lot more sense. And it's definitely a shame, as I love being able to play my favorite games using whatever device I want.</p><p>Ultimately, I think that we're going to experience a bit of a lull when it comes to Switch emulation. There have been quite a few attempts by others to pick up where Ryujinx and Yuzu left off, but it's just not the same vibe anymore. Thankfully, the Switch 2 release isn't too long of a wait, just long enough for me to still turn to my various Android gaming handhelds when the mood to play Switch games strikes.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>T-Mobile recently made the switch to the T-Life app, which is now a one-stop shop for all the carrier's offerings. You can claim rewards, manage your account, and pay your bill all in the app. However, a slew of recent T-Mobile policy changes now make using the T-Life app a necessity for most transactions — even while physically in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-t-mobile-phones">T-Mobile</a> store.</p><p>From the carrier's perspective, making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-old-t-mobile-app-is-officially-gone-for-good-time-to-download-t-life">T-Life app</a> a staple of both at-home and in-store transactions could be intended to improve consistency. Like most cellular carriers, T-Mobile stores nationwide are made up of corporate retail outlets as well as independent, authorized retailers. As such, the in-store experience could be different depending on which store you walk into.</p><p>Both customers and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> employees seem unsatisfied by the carrier's reported changes, as chronicled by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1j1cy39/migration_to_tlife_from_employees_pov/?share_id=W1WHib9e-Q-WN4m_oDHip&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=10&rdt=39554" target="_blank">multiple Reddit threads</a> on the r/tmobile subreddit. All the while, T-Mobile hasn't publicly acknowledged the policy shifts. Android Central reached out to T-Mobile for clarity on the changes, but the carrier didn't respond to our request for comment.</p><p>At least for now, it looks like T-Mobile's in-store experience is getting a lot more frustrating, and that's bad news for customers.</p>
<h2 id="t-mobile-is-pushing-t-life-hard-even-when-it-doesn-t-make-sense-2">T-Mobile is pushing T-Life hard, even when it doesn't make sense</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tayKpSosAMQZjqacPBJVcP" name="t-mobile-retail-storefront-169.jpg" alt="T-Mobile retail storefront" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tayKpSosAMQZjqacPBJVcP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2047" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have a unique perspective on T-Mobile's reported changes — not only as someone who changes SIM cards or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-esim-android">eSIMs</a> between phones every week or so but also as the person tasked with helping all my friends and family members with carrier problems. For transparency, I'm an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/att">AT&T</a> customer, but I have tested phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-verizon-phones">Verizon</a> and T-Mobile service in the past.</p><p>Even as someone who writes about tech for a living, it's often easier for me to walk into a store than make account changes online. Instead of jumping through a million hoops, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">2FA codes</a>, security questions, and IMEI numbers, I can tell a store associate exactly what I need — and they're happy to help. I'm usually in and out within a few minutes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CaZPop38EcXFxyZTngNwWZ" name="t-mobile-postpaid-magenta-on-s20.jpg" alt="T-Mobile Magenta plan information on an S20+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CaZPop38EcXFxyZTngNwWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's what the T-Mobile experience used to be like. Store representatives carried tablets that could be used to process transactions and assist customers on the back end. Now, both customers and employees claim that the bulk of T-Mobile transactions must be completed on the front end — also known as the T-Mobile app — even while in-store.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1jpntt9/bring_cash_if_you_want_to_transact_in_store">Bring Cash if you want to transact in store.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile">r/tmobile</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>There are seemingly endless reasons why this is a bad choice. For starters, certain groups of people, such as the elderly, are going to have a really hard time navigating the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-officially-kills-the-t-mobile-app-in-favor-of-t-life">T-Life app</a> to complete a transaction that should be simple. Yes, T-Mobile associates are going to be there to help, but it won't be as easy or as quick as just doing it themselves.</p><p>Additionally, there's the problem of people who have older or non-smart phones. Or, people whose phone has been lost or stolen. Or, people who want to pay in cash. What happens then?</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1jpntt9/bring_cash_if_you_want_to_transact_in_store/" target="_blank">Reddit posts</a>, employees can assist customers with their tablets in those cases. In particular, cash transactions can't be done with the T-Life app, so that's an easy way to avoid this situation. But that begs the question: if T-Mobile is still supporting its backend, retailer infrastructure, why not offer that experience to everyone?</p>
<h2 id="t-mobile-should-reverse-this-change-and-quickly-2">T-Mobile should reverse this change, and quickly</h2>
<p>To be clear, this isn't a problem that's exclusive to T-Mobile. For example, I've been denied at the Apple Store trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">buy an iPhone</a> because I didn't make an appointment beforehand. I was just as frustrated as I am reading the experiences of T-Mobile customers trying to visit brick-and-mortar stores now.</p><p>Put simply, people visit retail stores in 2025 because they want a person to help them with the task at hand. They don't want someone to hold their hand while being forced to use the T-Life app. Until this policy is reversed, I suspect more T-Mobile customers will express their frustration with the T-Life app, as they've been doing on Reddit for the past few weeks.</p>

<p>I have had the Magic Laptop Power Bank from Raycon with me for many moons now. Yet somehow, it ended up sitting unused in my pile of gadgets until very recently.</p><p>Raycon is a Bluetooth audio accessory brand primarily, offering a decent range of budget earbuds and headphones. The brand also dabbles in cables and chargers, some of which I have tested before.</p><p>This product claims to be a 5-in-1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable charging solution</a> that can be used to charge laptops as well as wireless charging phones and accessories. Let me preface this hands-on testing by saying that Raycon's charging tech isn't very popular. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/new-raycon-usb-c-cables-are-insanely-cool-and-functional">Their excellent USB-C cables</a> aside, the brand's audio accessory department is what puts them on the map.</p><p>For Raycon to sell the Magic Laptop Power Bank, it needs to provide a very good reason why you shouldn't stick with better, more reputable brands with higher-quality power banks that are also much more powerful. I'm not sure it succeeds here.</p>
<h2 id="how-not-to-sell-a-product-2">How (not) to sell a product</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3BEyLNzKFSJtiZyukyncKB" name="Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1" alt="Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3BEyLNzKFSJtiZyukyncKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As it stands, Raycon failed to effectively advertise the Magic Laptop Power Bank. Here's why.</p><p>Buying a portable power bank isn't the most straightforward process. Once you've figured out what capacity is suitable for your needs, you also have to figure out how many ports you're looking for, whether wireless charging is a priority or not, and how much power you require on the go. There are other factors such as the size and weight of the power bank that matter too.</p><p>So now you know what sort of information a potential customer would actively seek out when looking to purchase a power bank. It was unreasonably challenging for me to glean these details about Raycon's power bank from the online store listing.</p>

<p>The brand's product listing is basically a lesson on how not to sell a power bank, as it doesn't properly highlight or mention most of these details. For example, the Raycon 5-in-1 Magic Power Bank listing doesn't clearly mention the batter's capacity; you have to scroll down to figure this out.</p><p>Also, the power output and input ratings are vague at best. Sure, we know it's a laptop power bank because it's in the name. But what does that mean in terms of rated power?</p><p>A USB-C laptop charges at 60W and above. But since this is a multi-ported power bank, it's essential to know the total power output of the portable battery, which one of the ports supplies that power, and how the power splits when multiple devices are plugged into it at once.</p><p>Most brands like Anker, UGREEN, Baseus, and INIU provide detailed specifications about the ports on their charging tech as well as power distribution charts that showcase what charging speed the combined use of all the ports delivers.</p>

<p>The build quality isn't great either, the built-in cable feels very cheap, and the charging speeds are nothing to write home about. The USB-C ports support a 65W power output, but the USB-A port can only do a measly 18W, and the input is limited to an abysmal 30W with the prongs. If you need speedy recharging, the USB-C port supports 45W PD input.</p><p>Not only are exact charging speeds missing from the conversation, but the size and weight are also omitted. The only place you can even learn of this info is from the quick start guide inside the box. Why would you buy a product and <em>then</em> find out its exact specs?</p><p>But do you know what the website <em>does</em> advertise? A built-in stand for phones. However, the review sample Raycon sent me doesn't even have one.</p><p>I'm not happy with the quality of the Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1 or the way it skips key details when trying to convince people that it's a worthwhile buy.</p><p>Based on this I'm going to deduce that you, the reader, are not going to waste your time on Raycon's power bank. And I can't fault you with that, because there are so many better options out there.</p>

<p>All that doesn't even factor in the price, which is usually steep for high-quality power banks and battery packs.</p><p>Cheaping out is the worst thing you could do with charging tech because it's quite literally a potential safety risk. There's a good reason why airlines have such tight regulations around power banks. This is why most folks don't mind spending a little more on a solid portable power bank anyway.</p><p>Raycon's power bank is relatively cheaper, but it's very chunky and hefty for a 15,000mAh battery pack. You can easily score a GaN power bank that's more compact for the same amount of money and with better technical specifications.</p><p>On top of that, the current market for portable batteries, power banks, and hybrid chargers is insanely diverse. It's not difficult to find the right battery catered towards any individual for a decent price. Anker and UGREEN alone make enough power bank models to satisfy anybody out there, with a wide mix of ports, capacity, and power.</p><p>I don't recommend the Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1 at the end of the day. Why buy this when there are scores of fantastic, higher-quality options out there that disclose a lot more information?</p>

<hr>
<p>Intel Unison, a free Windows app that connects <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and tablets to PCs, is shutting down in just a few months. Users were notified of the impending shutdown this week on the Windows version of the app, and the Microsoft Store listing for Intel Unison was updated as well. By June 30, 2025, the app will be discontinued (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.neowin.net/news/intel-is-killing-an-awesome-free-windows-11-app-that-connects-pcs-with-phones/" target="_blank">Neowin</a>).</p><p>"Intel Unison will soon be discontinued," the Microsoft Store <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pp9gzm2gn26?hl=en-US&gl=US" target="_blank">listing</a> explains. "The first step in its wind-down process is ending service for most platforms at the end of June 2025. Lenovo Aura platforms will retain service through 2025."</p><p>Intel Unison offers a slew of features to make seamlessly connecting your Android devices to your Windows PCs. For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a>, Intel Unison enables wireless external display connection. It also makes it possible to make calls and send texts from your Windows PC using your Android phone. On top of that, you can drag-and-drop files and photos between devices.</p><p>While some of these features are available using the Microsoft Phone Link app, many viewed the Intel Unison app as a more robust experience with additional capabilities. Of course, all of those features will be discontinued by Intel by the end of June.</p>

<p>OnePlus is gearing up to release a smaller version of the OnePlus 13, and this week has been full of teasers. The company first revealed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-teases-its-upcoming-13t-as-a-part-of-an-april-fools-prank">the OnePlus 13T would launch this month in China</a> in an April Fool's Day gag. Now, President of OnePlus China Louis Lee took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/5150921408644564" target="_blank">Weibo</a> to share more about the upcoming "mini" OnePlus flagship.</p><p>First, Lee said the development of the OnePlus 13T began with a small goal. OnePlus wanted to dispel the notion that small handsets can't have large battery. This "small goal" underscores the company's larger goal in designing a smaller version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> — which Lee describes as to "make users who want to buy small-screen mobile phones but still have concerns more assured."</p><p>With a rumored 6.3-inch display, the OnePlus 13T would be miniature by OnePlus' standards, but regularly-sized by 2025 standards overall. It's tipped, but unconfirmed, that the OnePlus 13T could have a battery capacity in excess of 6,000mAh despite its small form factor.</p>

<p>This time, we have also made great efforts in terms of battery and endurance. It will be equipped with a new generation of glacier batteries," Lee writes in the post, translated to English. "[The] OnePlus 13T will be the small-screen mobile phone with the largest battery capacity and the best battery life in history. The proper small-screen battery life is the king!"</p><p>Other leaks surfaced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-oneplus-13t-just-inched-closer-to-launch-with-fresh-details-surfacing">OnePlus 13T in a regulatory filing</a>, referred to as PKX110, revealing that the device will come with 80W fast charging. It's also expected to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite </a>chipset and include a 50MP main camera sensor.</p><p>When it launches later this month, the OnePlus 13T will be the first "T-branded" device from the China phone-maker in three years. The last one was the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-10t-review"> OnePlus 10T</a>, which released in 2022.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is allegedly launching its slimmest Galaxy S25 Edge around May 13 via a virtual presentation.</li><li>Galaxy S25 Edge was reportedly scheduled to launch in April, but reports suggest that the company has pushed its launch due to technical issues.</li><li>While other sources say that the postponement came at the last minute, due to recent changes in the company's leadership following the death of Samsung DX head Jong-Hee Han.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>On Wednesday (April 2) we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-delays-galaxy-s25-edge-release-from-april-to-may-or-june-2025" target="_blank">reported</a> that Samsung is allegedly delaying the launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge. Early reports indicated that the phone would launch around the second week of April. However, yesterday, we heard some murmur that the company will now launch the device in May or June.</p><p>While we speculated several reasons for the Korean OEM's decision, we finally seem to have some answers. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,150033.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a>, sources close to Samsung told them that the launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge was postponed "at the last minute." The company said that they were dealing with some "technical issues with the device, which made further testing necessary."</p><p>Backing the publication's claims is German tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1907320951802315009" target="_blank">Max Jambor</a>. In his X post, he added that while people are eagerly awaiting its launch, Samsung continues to "fine-tune" the Galaxy S25 Edge behind the scenes. "While the device won't launch on April 15, it will still see the light of day somewhere in Q2 this year," Jambor said.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9fo8EsBntiCcnYkLJPARyh" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-parts-teaser" alt="Components for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on stage at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fo8EsBntiCcnYkLJPARyh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While these could be valid reasons for the Korean OEM to steer clear from launching a new phone,  the German website feels that there could be external factors at play.</p><p>For starters, the site states that Samsung wants to avoid a lack of public interest due to the tense political situation in its home country, South Korea. The company could be stalling the release "because the previous head of the mobile device division, Noh Tae-moon, recently suffered a heart attack and passed away at the age of just 64," the website added.</p><p>Whatever the reason behind the delay, the Galaxy S25 Edge has been one of Samsung's most anticipated phones yet, as it has been hyping the device since the start of 2025. While the company did not confirm the April 15 launch, several sources supported this claim. However, Samsung reportedly sent news of the delay to certain telecom operators in Korea, who were all set to sell this device in April.</p>

<p>As for when to expect the launch of the Samsung S25 Edge; a recent report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-may-2025-launch-date/">SamMobile</a> indicates that the company is pushing its launch date just by a month and sources told the publication that the slim phone will be unveiled on May 13.</p><p>"The South Korean company will launch the S25 Edge in a smaller online-only presentation, though this could vary by country," the publication added.</p><p>In terms of spec, the Galaxy S25 Edge is said to be 5.84mm thin, showcasing a titanium body and an Armor Aluminum frame. The phone could have a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>.</p><p>The phone is supposed to launch in three colors that match the Galaxy S25 Ultra: "Titanium Jet Black," "Titanium Silver," and "Titanium Icy Blue."  The Galaxy S25 Edge will have two rear cameras stacked vertically: a primary 200MP lens and a 12MP lens for ultra-wide shots, along with a selfie camera, which we don't have much information about. We also hear that the 256GB model will cost around €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400), while the 512GB version might hit €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520).</p><p>Lastly, WinFuture indicated that Samsung could soon release a video teasing the Galaxy S25 Edge, considering it could launch in the next two months.</p>

That means Android 16 has already achieved platform stability with the Beta 3 update, although it still isn't perfect. Any Google Pixel 6 or newer smartphone can test out the Android 16 beta by participating in the Android Beta Program, but what if you want out?</p><p>Luckily, it's possible to opt out of the Android Beta Program and uninstall the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 beta</a> if you have second thoughts. There are easy methods that completely erase your phone and one way to keep your data that requires a bit of patience. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-ways-you-can-uninstall-the-android-16-beta-2">All the ways you can uninstall the Android 16 beta</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DsBa2t3vEyHabPemsFwwK8" name="android-15-21.jpg" alt="Android 15 home page on Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsBa2t3vEyHabPemsFwwK8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We always recommend users back up their device before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">installing the Android 16 beta</a>, and there's a key reason for that — it's very inconvenient to uninstall the beta without erasing your data. The only way to uninstall the Android 16 beta is to wait for its official public release; all other methods require completely erasing your device. There are three options available:</p>
<ul><li>Opt out of the Android Beta Program and wait for an over-the-air (OTA) update that erases your device, reverting it to the latest stable version.</li><li>Opt out of the Android Beta Program and wait for the stable version of the update you're testing, which will be sent as an over-the-air (OTA) update — <strong>this option can take up to three to four months</strong>.</li><li>Install a stable version of Android using the <a href="https://flash.android.com/" target="_blank">Android Flash Tool</a> or ADB — <strong>this involves sideloading, will erase ALL of your data, and is only recommended for advanced users</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>For most users, we recommend using the first method to opt out of the Android Beta Program an applying the OTA update. It will delete all the data on your phone, but this can be restored from an older device backup.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-opt-out-of-the-android-beta-program-2">How to opt out of the Android Beta Program</h2>
<p>Before you can receive an OTA update with a stable version of Android, you'll need to opt out of the Android Beta Program on the web. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Open the Android Beta Program site's Devices tab</strong> (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta#devices" target="_blank">direct link</a>). Make sure you are logged into the same Google account as your Pixel phone.</p><p>2. <strong>Find the device</strong> you want to unenroll from the Android Beta Program, and click <strong>Opt out</strong>.</p>

<p>After opting out of the Android 16 beta on the web, you can return to a stable version of Android 15 by installing the OTA update sent to your device. This could take 24 hours to appear, and <strong>will delete your data</strong>.</p><p>If you didn't back up your device prior to installing the Android 16 beta, you <strong>should not</strong> install the update sent to your device within a day. Instead, you should wait for the stable version of the update to arrive. For example, if you are testing the Android 16 beta, you should wait for the first official Android 16 update in order to keep your data intact.</p><p>When you are ready to install the OTA update — either the rollback update or the official stable release — you'll need to follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Pixel phone.</p><p>2. Navigate to <strong>System</strong> > <strong>Software update</strong> > <strong>System update</strong>.</p><p>3. You may need to tap <strong>Check for update</strong> to find the latest OTA update.</p><p>4. When the update appears, follow the on-screen prompts to <strong>download and install it</strong>.</p>

<p>It may take a while for the update to be download and optimized for your device. Make sure your device is charged, or connected to power, to complete the update. Your phone might restart multiple times throughout this process, but when it is all said and done, you'll be running a stable version of Android 15.</p>

<p>There are many good reasons to uninstall the latest Android 16 beta, but they usually come to one key issue: bugs. Since the Android Beta Program entirely consists of pre-release software, it is riddled with bugs and issues. Even platform-stable updates, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Android 16 Beta 3</a>, are going to have problems you wouldn't face on a public version of Android — evidenced by the fact <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-android-16-beta-3-1-patch-with-crucial-bug-fixes">Google released Android 16 Beta 3.1</a> to fix some of those very bugs.</p><p>If you've had enough of the instability or simply want to patiently wait for the public version of Android 16, there's always the option to uninstall the beta using these methods.</p>

<p>Google Pixel 10 leaks have been popping up quite often since the past week. What started as full-blown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">CAD renders </a>of the device has turned into significant spec leaks. We heard some chatter that the standard model finally getting a tri-camera setup with an added telephoto lens, joining the other two devices in the lineup.</p><p>Now the most recent leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-pixel-10-camera-details-3540182/">Android Authority,</a> as the publication claims that it was able to view internal documents that reveal major camera changes chalked out for the Google Pixel 10 series.</p>

<p>According to an inside source, Google will finally shake things up with its standard flagship model this year, at least with its camera.</p><p>Usually, the base models come with a wide and ultrawide lens. However, this time, it might get a third telephoto lens, and the tech giant is allegedly going to downgrade the whole camera setup to accommodate the new lens, so much so that these leaked specs reveal it being closer to the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>.</p><p>The primary sensor on the Pixel 10 will allegedly be replaced by a Samsung GN8, a smaller one than the GNV sensor used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.</p><p>"Similarly, the ultrawide lens has been downgraded to a Sony IMX712 from the previous IMX858," the publication states, noting that it will have a lower 13MP lens. It's seemingly a downgrade from last year's 48MP ultrawide camera. The publication adds that the new telephoto lens will get an 11MP resolution and Samsung 3J1 sensor, similar to the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>At the same time, the specs for the front-facing camera remain unchanged (11 MP).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rNDVh9bKGPJxkMYx2CfFBm" name="Pixel-10-camera-spec-leak" alt="Infographic showing alleged camera specs of the Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rNDVh9bKGPJxkMYx2CfFBm.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While megapixels really don't dictate the quality of the image, the camera sensors do. And if this leak holds true, then the tech giant seems to be compromising on image quality to get an additional lens into the standard model.</p><p>While post-shoot edits and Google's computational photography will help improve image quality, a smaller sensor only makes shooting in low-light conditions even tougher. And seeing the specs of a budget model show up in a flagship device is certainly disappointing.</p><p>Rumors suggest that the Google Pixel 10 Pro and the Pro XL will keep last year's camera specs. However, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could see a minor change with its primary lens. "The primary Sony IMX787 (used in the Pixel 8a) will be replaced with the Samsung GN8 (used in the Pixel 9a)," the publication added.</p><p>That said, we know that all three phones will supposedly be retaining their designs as their predecessors, and will be powered by Google's new Tensor G5 SoC chip. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked">another leak indicated</a> that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be offered at a "lower price point" compared to last year, and will be powered by the Tensor G5 as well.</p><p>Lastly, these leaks should be taken with a grain of salt as there's no confirmation that these specs will show up in the actual device. While we wait for the ball to drop, here's. what we expect to see from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series.</a></p>

Like any good kids sleepover party, this one involved a lot of video games. Everyone had gotten a Meta Quest 3S for Christmas and they couldn't wait to play while everyone was in the same house.</p>

<p>Except they never got to play because of one bug or another. One headset lost tracking and refused to allow us to work unless it was in travel mode — something that doesn't work when you're trying to play a game like Dungeons of Eternity since it restricts movement. One of the other headsets refused to populate the friends list, making it impossible for them to join a game together. After an hour of troubleshooting, they all went back to their trusty Nintendo Switches for the rest of the night.</p><p>One boy, who had just upgraded from a Quest 1 to a Quest 3S, told me that he had never had problems like this with his first Quest, and he didn't understand how Meta could make a newer product worse than an old one. While I understood the technical reasons for the problems he was experiencing — mostly problems caused by the extremely buggy v74 update — they couldn't change the frustration he felt at the process.</p><p>The issue lies entirely in Meta's seeming inability to conduct a proper QA process for its regular system updates. The company is too focused on shipping new features regularly than being concerned with delivering bug-free updates. In many ways, it reminds me a lot of the Google Pixel series of phones, which have suffered from the same type of problem since the Pixel 6, and it's time Meta starts prioritizing stability over capability.</p>

<p>This year has been terrible for Meta Quest updates. There's no mincing words. Back in December, just as folks were unboxing their brand new Meta Quest 3S headsets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v72-bad-christmas-update">a bad update to firmware V72</a> began bricking devices. The company acknowledged the bad update within a few days but did a poor job communicating the issue to its customer service team.</p><p>That meant that not only could people <em>not use</em> the headset they just received as a gift, but some customers had to fight tooth and nail to get a warranty replacement in the first place. It wasn't a good first impression for new Meta Quest owners.</p><p>Not two months later, the V74 update rolled out, bringing amazing new features that could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v74-feature-is-set-to-revolutionize-immersive-experiences">soon revolutionize immersive experiences</a>. Except that the feature shipped with serious experience-breaking bugs. As evidenced in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Announcements/PTC-v74-Release-Thread/ba-p/1288416">official V74 testing thread</a> on Meta's community forums, <strong>a lot</strong> of people found the update to be less than satisfactory.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta is too focused on shipping new features regularly than being concerned with delivering bug-free updates, and that's a huge problem.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One Meta Quest V74 bug keeps the headset from charging fully, stopping at 74% for some unknown reason. Players noticed that severe network lag all of a sudden caused PC VR games to be unplayable. Secondary accounts on the headset wouldn't load games at all, and even after a "fix," there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Get-Help/PTC-v76-serious-secondary-account-issues/m-p/1309030">still severe issues</a> trying to play games on non-primary headset accounts.</p><p>A new bug causes the UI to randomly disappear when waking the device from sleep. Despite being flagged during the two-month testing phase, it was never fixed before V74 was released to the public. I could go on with several more examples, but you get the point: Meta Quest firmware updates are buggy, and they're causing people to get fed up with their headsets.</p><p>This doesn't exactly look good for a company that is actively fighting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">protect its image</a> among VR enthusiasts while developers face <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-joining-forces-to-solve-the-vr-visibility-crisis">a very real visibility crisis</a>.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Meta Quest gamers expect to put their headset on and play the game they want. They don't want to be bothered with troubleshooting or tinkering.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While it's true that Meta has been working hard to outplay potential competitors in the space with rapid feature evolution, the company isn't doing a great job of ensuring that existing users have a good experience. Mainly, that means having a <em>stable</em> experience.</p><p>One of the main reasons I stopped playing PC VR games years ago was because I was tired of the troubleshooting. Oftentimes, I would spend more time troubleshooting why a game wasn't working than I would actually playing the game. I went so far as to sell my PC last year and replace it with a Steam Deck so I could still play PC games without all the driver hassles and tinkering. I just want things to work, and that's why I play VR games on a Meta Quest.</p><p>Meta needs to remember that this is a gaming console. Like a Nintendo Switch 2, a PlayStation 5, or an Xbox Series X, Meta Quest gamers expect to put their headset on and play the game they want. They don't want to be bothered with troubleshooting or tinkering. That nonsense is for the PC players who enjoy graphical fidelity at the expense of tweaking and tinkering.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It's time for Meta to slow its update schedule down and ensure that updates are something people look forward to rather than fear.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As Meta moves forward with Meta Quest update V76, it's time the company starts taking stability more seriously and letting new features take a back seat to a quality experience. That means the company needs to start <strong>fixing bugs</strong> before releasing new firmware to the public. If a major bug still persists, a firmware update should be delayed until said bug has been squashed.</p><p>But as I've said, Google is just as guilty of this sin as Meta. Whether it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-6-devices-android-15-bricking-reports">phone-breaking Android updates</a>, weird <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">storage and display issues</a>, or even something as inconvenient as your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported">morning alarm not sounding</a>, Google's phones often feel more like a testbed than a stable platform.</p><p>Any human-made piece of software is going to have problems or bugs that need squashing, but a regimen of monthly updates isn't what the doctor ordered for a stable computing platform. Rather, companies like Meta need to slow things down a bit and ensure that updates are something people look forward to rather than fear.</p><p>When users are constantly looking for ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flash-tool-downgrade-pixel-firmware">roll back software updates</a>, you know you've got a problem.</p><p>As the Meta Quest platform gains traction and becomes more mainstream, Meta must keep buggy updates away from its headsets. VR gaming already has enough friction without bugs and problems as it is without these silly, needless problems being added to it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing has unveiled new devices for its flagship brand, but its more affordable sub-unit is just getting started with teasers.</p><p>Early today (Apr. 3), CMF by Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1907719990662340998">posted a teaser</a> for an upcoming device with a quick video that indicates one its core upgrades (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/04/03/nothing-shares-first-teaser-for-cmf-phone-2/">Gizmochina</a>). The short video seemingly shows off a singular camera lens on the back of an orange CMF Phone. The clip showcases the device with deep technological ridges and cuts. It's unclear if these could be real features on the phone's rear panel or just for visual effect.</p><p>Additionally, CMF by Nothing adds the tagline, "In search of the perfect shot," and finishes with "coming soon."</p><p>The publication also highlighted a recent discovery of a Nothing member's post of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/03/29/nothing-teases-4-new-devices/">several Pokemon</a>. It's been assumed that the Pokemon symbolizes the codenames for upcoming devices from the CMF sub-brand. Bulbasaur reportedly concerns the CMF Phone 2, while the remaining three Pokemon could indicate new wearables and earbuds from the affordable brand.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In search of the perfect shot.Coming soon. pic.twitter.com/tEbBVUB6UX<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1907719990662340998">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Showing a singular lens for this (ideally) second CMF Phone might seem odd when you remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">the first model</a> had a dual array. However, images for a set of alleged CMF Phone 2 prototypes appeared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NOTHING/comments/1jezu35/cmf_phone_2_and_i_think_its_compact/#lightbox">on Reddit</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/new-nothing-cmf-phone-2-leak-suggests-it-might-be-a-samsung-galaxy-a26-killer_id168658">Phone Arena</a>). The photos showcase the device in black, but the takeaway is that it sports a triple-camera array. The device is showcased with the vertical dual array that we've seen previously, but that third lens is off to the side with its LED flash right beneath it.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NOTHING/comments/1jezu35/cmf_phone_2_and_i_think_its_compact">Cmf phone 2 and i think its compact</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NOTHING">r/NOTHING</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The tipster on Reddit claims the phone is "compact." Unfortunately, the specifics of this extra lens weren't stated. The CMF Phone 1 delivered a 50MP main lens with EIS and a 2x zoom, portrait mode only lens.</p><p>We've had the idea of a "CMF Phone 2" in the back of our minds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-future-trio-specs-database-leak">since rumors about it</a> surfaced in December. The device was reportedly discovered within the IMEI database alongside Nothing's Phone 3a and 3a Plus. While the former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">have already launched</a>, the CMF Phone 2 supposedly holds model number A001 internally.</p><p>Little else about the device was discovered a few months ago, but if CMF by Nothing is teasing it, there's a chance launch isn't far away.</p>

And for now, that's probably the best we can hope for to make smart rings longer-lasting. But there's a more fundamental fix — patented by Oura, unsurprisingly — that I think Samsung needs to consider for the Galaxy Ring's future.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">report</a>, Samsung is considering using solid electrolytes instead of a traditional lithium-ion battery, increasing the energy density from 200 to 360Wh/L and offering greater flexibility that would be perfect for this rounded form factor.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring 2 could be the "first case" of Samsung using this tech, followed by the Galaxy Buds and Watch in later years. However, the report stresses that this battery tech is quite expensive; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> is already costlier than most smart rings at $399, and this battery could push the Ring 2 over the edge of what most people will pay.</p><p>But let's ignore cost and say that Samsung can increase its Ring's battery efficiency. Its <em>capacity</em> will still be limited by physics and thermals, and the lack of smart ring repairability means any battery problem will be fatal. That is unless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> start to become more modular.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-smart-rings-2">The problem with smart rings</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3sGWcko3E7aG2PnDTK5TxW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-battery-life-01.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring alongside the Samsung Wearables app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3sGWcko3E7aG2PnDTK5TxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultrahuman is one of the few smart ring brands to speak openly about battery health. On its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/faq/">FAQ page</a>, it promises that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> lasts 500 charging cycles "before there is any significant decline in battery performance," but that "a gradual reduction in battery life can be expected after 1 to 2 years" and wouldn't be covered by the warranty.</p><p>Even if other brands don't say it outright, smart rings are especially susceptible to battery issues. Most can only squeeze in about 20–30mAh of capacity while keeping the design skinny. They're optimized at the start to go a week on minimal capacity, but <em>any</em> loss of capacity will have an outsized effect over time. You'll probably notice the same issue with wireless earbuds.</p><p>Let's make an unscientific guess that Samsung's dream battery increases the Galaxy Ring 2 capacity to 50mAh, or even 100mAh. That's still on a scale well below a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> (300–425mAh) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> (4,000–5,000mAh), with natural drain after a couple of years but with capacity to spare.</p>

<p>More importantly, your Galaxy watch or phone is repairable; you can <em>replace</em> a deficient battery.</p><p>That wouldn't apply to Samsung's curved electrode battery, shoved into a dense, complex design. Generally speaking, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-are-disposable-tech">smart rings are disposable tech</a> because once they're constructed, you can't take them apart and put them back together again. This lack of repairability hurts consumers <em>and</em> manufacturers.</p><p>After I reviewed the Ultrahuman Ring Air, my fiancee decided to buy one and loved it. But after 3 months, it suddenly died, refusing to charge or reconnect to her phone.</p><p>Because it fell under warranty, Ultrahuman had to mail her a brand new one. It couldn't be repaired and sent back or refurbished for a new sale. It might not even be able to figure out what went wrong with it or if it was her fault (it wasn't). It just has to keep making new rings and throwing out the old ones — which must be expensive, depending on the failure rate.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BeCuwuZWt7RVvEXLSFfmU4" name="oura-ring-patent-module-1" alt="A patent figure showing a smart ring with a pre-designed cavity that an attachable module could slot into." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BeCuwuZWt7RVvEXLSFfmU4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UPSTO / Oura Health Oy)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When researching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-5">Oura Ring 5</a>, I discovered a ton of cool patents for redesigning its ring, mostly to make it one-size-fits-all. But I was most intrigued by patent US-12177997-B2, "Functional cover with wireless connection for ring wearable." As the patent figure above shows, the ring could have a removable module that slides into a predesigned cavity.</p><p>Why design it this way? For one thing, the battery is "frequently the module in a device that declines in performance most quickly," so when it fails, "a user may be forced to upgrade to a newer module...even though the previous wearable device otherwise operated as intended."</p><p>With Oura's design, the ring top would be removable, so users could slot in a new battery module, or slot in modules designed for other purposes like fitness tracking, contactless payments, location tracking, and so on.</p><p>Thus, buying a replacement module would be less expensive than buying a new ring, and you could hypothetically own two battery modules and swap between them when one dies, so you never have to take the ring off.</p>

<p>I have no idea how easy this would be to implement or if such a module would blend in as a normal-looking ring top. Oura has other patents it could use instead, like US-20240385649-A1 — "Wearable Ring Device with Battery in Cover" — that focuses instead on squeezing a thin, 360º battery layer into the cover so that it doesn't interfere with the internal components.</p><p>It's not about what Oura ends up doing; it's that Oura evidently knows that the status quo — short-lived rings you can't repair or improve over time — hurts them with consumers who don't want to spend $300–400 every two or three years on a new ring. And it's looking for solutions.</p><p>Samsung's solid-state battery is an intriguing solution, too! But it's a stop-gap measure. In theory, it'll build up the Galaxy Ring 2 battery life so much that even when it loses capacity, it'll still last long enough to avoid daily charges. But it's still a battery shoved into a device you can't open without breaking it.</p><p>So long as smart rings cannot be repaired or refurbished, consumers will hesitate to buy one after another, not knowing how long they'll last.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung was spotted publishing a patent for its smart ring that involves quite a unique charging method.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-could-use-a-novel-way-to-charge/">SamMobile</a> highlights this new patent in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025063477">WIPO</a>, which explains the idea of charging your Galaxy Ring with your Galaxy phone. The patent in question explores the possibility of slotting the device into a circular opening on the back of a Galaxy phone. Samsung's title for the patent is "Electronic Device Comprising Seating Structure."</p><p>The Korean OEM provided a quick sketch of the theorized product, which shows a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a> around a circular peg, similar to the device's current charging method in its case. The sketch doesn't explain if the Ring would be flush to the phone's back or if it would stick out a little while it's charging.</p><p>The illustration previews what the internal components would look like, which hold the pins for the electrical charge.</p><p>The publication spotted a few more details in the full abstract, such as Samsung's idea of bringing this method to foldables, as well as "certain cases." Elsewhere, it noticed the company mention the possibility for the Galaxy Ring to upload "health and fitness data" when slotted for charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:154.24%;"><img id="FmQqRAvQBEkJXopHWYR7G4" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-galaxy-phone-slotted-charging-patent" alt="Samsung recently published a patent that shows a Galaxy Ring charging method within a Galaxy phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FmQqRAvQBEkJXopHWYR7G4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="389" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WIPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's probably no surprise that the existence of a patent means nothing without official company statements. There's a chance we might never see this idea, especially when you consider Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-working-on-a-thin-galaxy-z-fold-phone-with-s-pen-support">recent trend of thin phones</a>. It's even been rumored to remove the S Pen digitizer from its next Galaxy Z Fold for the sake of making it thinner — and the stylus was able to charge from within, too.</p><p>We've seen unique (and cool) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-resizing-patent-discovered">Galaxy Ring patents before</a>, like one from October that showed elastic internals that could alter its size to fit your finger. Samsung published that new patent last fall in South Korea with illustrations of a smart ring with a "resizing structure." The company also described it as "transformable," depending on the person. The patent explained three resizing structures for its rings with three, four, and eight internal segments.</p><p>Those segments would enable more or less "resizing" for your finger.</p><p>It's a neat idea, but there's nothing actionable to make this feel real amid rising interests in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">Galaxy Ring 2</a>. There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-2-new-enhancements-launch-rumored">were rumors</a> that the Korean OEM could reveal this next device "earlier" with an increased battery life and a thinner build. Additionally, a more recent report from South Korea claims Samsung is looking to implement "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">dream batteries</a>," more commonly known as "all-solid-state batteries," in the Ring 2, which could give it a battery capacity boost.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has started rolling out yet another beta for its latest Android 16 operating system. The new incremental update comes right after two weeks when the Android 16 Beta 3.1 was rolled out for Pixel phones.</p><p>The latest Android 16 Beta 3.2 update, bearing <strong>BP22.250221.015</strong> version, includes a bunch of fixes, including for devices like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The fixes with the latest firmware include an issue that caused haptic feedback to be miscalibrated in some cases. An issue causing excessive battery drain on some Pixel phones even when they weren't in use seems to have been fixed as well.</p>

<p>Talking about the Pixel 6 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-pro-review">Pixel 6 Pro</a>, this update is fixing an issue of screen flickers while shooting pictures or videos on their devices. Additionally, other issues, which seem to have been impacting system stability and usability, have also been addressed with the latest beta 3.2 update.</p><p>For those unaware, the latest Android 16 Beta 3.2 is available for beta testers using Pixel 6 and above. They are likely to receive the Over the Air (OTA) update within the first 24 hours of the release, which was initially announced on April 2. Users can navigate to Settings> System> System updates on their aforementioned Pixel owners, provided they are already enrolled in the beta program.</p>

<p>It appears Google is cleaning things up for Android 16  stable release with incremental updates rolling out. As mentioned, the search giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-android-16-beta-3-1-patch-with-crucial-bug-fixes">rolled out beta 3.1</a> update in March, which also didn't include any new features but rather only included bug fixes.</p><p>Some of the notable ones comprised brightness levels fluctuating issues and some of the Pixel phones experienced Settings app crashes, which were also addressed in the same beta update.</p><p>On the other hand, Google is also gearing up for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">IO event</a>, which is scheduled for May 20 and is taking place at Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountain View, California. We expect to see more of Android 16 alongside Google's AI innovations at the event.</p>

<ul><li>Google recently published a support document that highlights new Gemini and Photos app integration for Android phones and tablets.</li><li>Users can "search for a specific memory or recall information" from their photo galleries with Gemini with detailed places, faces, dates, and events.</li><li>The feature is arriving for a limited group of invited users.</li><li>While the feature seems similar to its "Ask Photos" test, Google teased during a major Gemini app announcement that such capabilities were on the way.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently highlighted a brand new iteration of its Photos app integration with its  AI model, Gemini.</p><p>As Google upgrades the Gemini mobile app, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15734842">support document</a> states that users can "search for a specific memory or recall information" from their gallery. Users can do so in a variety of ways, beginning with Google's Photos app prompts. The document highlights the ability for users to use natural language with specifics about themes and past events.</p><p>Using the @Google Photos (or "my photos" alternatively) tag, the company gives the following example: "What themes have we had for Lena’s birthday parties?" Additionally, you can say something like, "What are the top 10 things we saw on our last trip?"</p><p>Specifically, the document states users can " ask for photos" and "ask about them." Users can find specific faces and relationships in photos stored in their gallery. The Photos app integration in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will also accept questions about locations and the dates a picture was taken. Moreover, users can attempt to describe the photo they're looking for and have Gemini take care of the rest.</p><p>Once Gemini discovers what you're looking for, Google says users can tap the picture in the AI's app, which will open it fully in the Photos app. Similarly, if the AI surfaced an entire album for you, interacting with it will open its entirety in Photos. Google adds that Android phones and tablets can "Drag and drop a photo from the Gemini on-screen overlay into another app."</p>

<p>These new Gemini and Photos app abilities are arriving in the model's Android app (tablets included); however, it's only for a "selected group of invited users." Google warns that not everyone will receive early access. Your prompts must be in English for this test. Elsewhere, if you do have access, you must ensure you're signed into Gemini with the same Google account as Photos.</p><p>Google will also give you the chance to connect your Photos content with Gemini when the time comes.</p>

<p>On the surface, what the company is highlighting seems extremely similar to its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">Ask Photos</a>" test currently in early access via Labs. In fact, Google directly mentions this in its recent support document, stating users can try and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15318661">opt-in</a>. Early Access in Labs kicked off in September with Google's confidence that Gemini could "understand the context" of your gallery.</p><p>The "Ask Photos" test involves a bit of Gemini's influence directly inside the Photos app, but Google's recent updates bring stronger integration via the AI's app on mobile.</p><p>With that in mind, perhaps it's a product of Google's huge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">Gemini app personalization update</a> announcement. In that press release, the company mentioned the Photos app directly, stating users can ask for help/questions "based on your photos." It didn't mention any 2.0 Flash Thinking experimental influence, but it could be there under the hood.</p>

<p>The listing reveals several graphics of the potential design the phone could carry. It shows multiple angles of the multi-fold device, both folded and unfolded. In the image above, we see four screen panels connected together with multiple hinges, allowing it to fold inward.</p><p>It looks like the multi-fold will see the same functionality as the "tri-fold" phone, only that it will have each panel folding inward instead of just one, as some tri-fold phones have been shown to do. Assuming there's just one display across all hinges, this would give the device a large, tablet-like screen when folded outwards or as a compact phone that they can slide into their pockets when all sides are folded in.</p><p>While this is still a patent and doesn't mean that these illustrations will turn into usable devices, there may be some solid foundation that Samsung is building on.  The tech giant recently showed off prototypes of multi-fold screens at this year's MWC last month— <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mwc-2025-coolest-things-we-saw#section-samsung-display-s-claw-like-foldable">showcasing its Flex G and Flex S designs;</a> these are foldable panels that look like what its future tri-folding and multi-folding devices would look like. The company also showcased a claw-like foldable that could close vertically, leaving a sliver of screen at the center.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-112">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is working on a desktop-style Chrome for Android with extension support, something mobile Chrome has been missing.</li><li>This new version is designed for larger Android devices like Chromebooks, and it’s a big step toward closing the gap between mobile and desktop browsing.</li><li>It’s still a bit rough—no easy way to manage extensions, no toolbar button, and installing them isn’t as smooth as on desktop.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is apparently working on a unique version of Chrome for Android with a full-fledged desktop-style interface. This version stands out by finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-how-google-could-safely-bring-extensions-chrome-android">bringing browser extension support</a>, something the current mobile Chrome completely lacks.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> might be huge on Android, but it has always lagged behind its desktop version, especially when it comes to extensions. Now, Google is working on changing that with a desktop-class Chrome for Android, finally bringing extension support into the mix, as per Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-for-android-with-extensions-demo-3540132/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>Thanks to a recent code tweak, users can now manually install extensions by simply dragging and dropping .crx files into the chrome://extensions page.</p>
<h2 id="built-for-big-screens-2">Built for big screens</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.70%;"><img id="SvXNPCUcg5kuHJc9pXdMEC" name="browser-extension-support-Chrome-Android" alt="browser extension support for Chrome on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SvXNPCUcg5kuHJc9pXdMEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="707" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>True to its name and the reports from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/desktop-chrome-android-extensions-3488455/" target="_blank">late 2024</a>, the Desktop Android version of Chrome is built to bring the browser’s core features to large-screen Android devices, including Chromebooks and other computers. With Chrome OS on its way out, a solid replacement is more important than ever.</p><p>Rahman has been putting these test Chrome builds through their paces, and the results speak for themselves. He's already got extensions like Dark Reader, Keepa, and uBlock Origin up and running, proving that an Android-based Chrome can fully support extensions.</p><p>Despite the progress, there are still a few hiccups. For one, users can’t access extension settings yet, and there’s no toolbar button to easily toggle extensions. Additionally, without a Chrome Web Store equivalent for Android, installing extensions still feels a bit basic. It works, but it's definitely not polished.</p><p>It appears that Google is currently putting all its energy into just making extensions work at all. So, to check on or manage your extensions, you'll need to head straight to the chrome://extensions page.</p>
<h2 id="regular-phones-don-t-hold-your-breath-2">Regular phones? Don’t hold your breath</h2>
<p>Adding extension support to Chrome for Android is a big step toward matching the desktop browsing experience. Sure, it’s still a bit rough around the edges, but make no mistake: this is the foundation for something huge.</p><p>That said, these changes probably won’t lead to extensions being available on Chrome for regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Google has purposely stayed away from adding extension support on Android, unlike Firefox and Microsoft Edge, signaling a clear strategy behind the decision.</p>

<p>Qualcomm has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8s-gen-4-mobile-platform#features">announced</a> the launch of its new Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 mobile platform today (April 2). This new chip is said to improve the performance of mid-tier flagship phones compared to the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3. It is specifically designed for smartphones that focus on gaming compared to the other features on the phone.</p><p>According to the chip maker's press release, the new chip features Kryo cores instead of Oryon like in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip. It sports a 1+3+2+2 core configuration that claims to clock speeds at up to 3.2 GHz, which is higher than its predecessor (3.0 GHz).</p><p>Regarding the changes in its GPU, the SD 8s Gen 4 is equipped with an Adreno 825 GPU, which increases the chip's performance by 49% compared to the 8s Gen 3 (features in phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>). This enables real-time accelerated ray tracing and global illumination, delivering improved lighting, shadows, and reflections during gameplay.</p><p>The chip is said to bring with it some of Snapdragon's elite gaming experience, "including the Qualcomm Adaptive Performance Engine and Adreno Frame Motion Engine 2.0." This will, in turn, improve the user's gaming sessions without using up a lot of the device's power.</p>

<p>Qualcomm has made significant changes to the chip's Neural Processing Unit (NPU), and its "Qualcomm AI Engine" is said to improve AI performance by 44%. This enables the chip to easily process and run multi-modal Gen AI models, much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google's Gemini</a> or ChatGPT within the phone. The chip gets 2x larger shared memory that speeds up the user's interaction with LLMs or LVMs.</p><p>This Hexagon NPU also has the intelligence to snap better pictures automatically and is now enhanced to support a 320 MP single-camera sensor, significantly higher than the 200MP on the SD 8s Gen 3.</p><p>Higher sensor support comes with better photography, including better object recognition of up to 250 different things in a single 4K image, and helps capture photos that naturally color-correct the image based on the lighting around them. Additionally, this chip will also support better nighttime photography, with Night Vision 2.0 recording ultra-low light videos at a smooth 4K30 FPS.</p>

<p>Other notable features of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 include uninterrupted entertainment with the Snapdragon Sound Technology Suite, featuring Qualcomm aptX Audio for lossless CD-quality music, and Qualcomm's eXpanded Personal Area Network (XPAN) technology, which "keeps earbuds and headphones connected via Wi-Fi" for uninterrupted audio during intense game sessions.</p><p>Lastly, when it comes to connectivity,  the chip gets the same Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF as the SD 8s Gen 3, which is said to increase download speeds up to 4.2Gbps on any 5G network and also works on conserving the device's battery when connected to it. It comes with support for Wi-Fi 7 at up to 5.8Gbps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bluetooth-6">Bluetooth 6</a>.</p><p>According to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/qualcomm_snapdragon_8s_gen_4_announced_with_kryo_cpu_adreno_825_gpu-news-67213.php"> GSM Arena</a>, this chip is expected to debut on the iQOO Z10 Turbo and more devices from Xiaomi, Oppo, Meizu, and more.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola has announced a new mid-range phone for multiple regions under its popular Edge series. The Edge 60 Fusion claims to be designed for consumers who are seeking a premium smartphone with its elegant design and AI-driven features.</p><p>The colors of the Edge 60 Fusion appear to be the initial highlight of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range handset</a>, including the materials utilized for the unique finish. Motorola has opted to use faux-leather and canvas-inspired back panels to bring a distinctive aesthetic to the handset. The inclusion of Pantone-validated colors is also a plus.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GzB3tGajAtBQdRXqC6dtwP" name="Motorola-Edge-60-Fusion-colors" alt="Motorola Edge 60 Fusion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzB3tGajAtBQdRXqC6dtwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Edge 60 Fusion also touts itself as a durable device as it comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 7i protection next to military standards (MIL-STD 810H) build and additionally it also has IP68 and IP69 ratings.</p><p>Moto AI has been incorporated into the latest handset, making it the first Motorola handset to feature it — to make "everyday tasks simpler and more intuitive." According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-brings-the-worlds-first-quad-curve-edge-display-with-pantone-validated-colors-to-the-motorola-edge-60-fusion/">company's blog post</a>, the said AI features right out of the box include:</p>
<p>"Assistive prompts like Pay attention, which helps users record, transcribe, and summarize audio to create notes, and Remember this, which captures live moments or on-screen information when triggered, to more creative tools like Magic Canvas, which generates AI-created images from text prompts. Moto AI is there to make every experience on the Edge 60 Fusion smarter and more seamless. "</p>

<p>The Edge 60 Fusion packs in a 6.67-inch pOLED screen featuring Super HD resolution (1220p) and a 120Hz refresh rate panel. The other perks of the display include support for Water Touch technology, which helps you use the device flawlessly when your hands are wet. It also supports DC dimming technology for a more comfortable viewing experience with less flickering.</p><p>For cameras, the Edge 60 Fusion is equipped with a 50MP primary camera, which is a Sony LYTIA 700C sensor paired with a 13MP ultra-wide-angle lens and a three-in-one light sensor. On the front, the device relies on a 32MP selfie shooter.</p>
<p>Powering the device underneath is a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 SoC coupled with up to 8GB of RAM and with support for RAM Boost. The onboard storage goes up to 256GB. There is a decent 5200mAh battery capacity that supports Motorola's 68W fast charging, which promises to give a full battery with eight minutes of charging.</p><p>Lastly, the device is shipping with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box.
