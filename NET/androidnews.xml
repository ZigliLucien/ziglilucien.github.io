<ul><li>Google really wants more people to use Palm Timer, as evidenced by two new references to the feature this month.</li><li>There's a new community post that reminds Pixel owners that Palm Timer can be used on both the front and rear cameras.</li><li>This comes shortly after Pixel Camera 9.8 rolled out with tweaked wording for the Palm Timer setting.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>This month, Google has taken multiple steps to let Pixel phone owners know that the Palm Timer in the Camera app works with both the front and rear cameras. First, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-camera-9-8-rolls-out-alongside-the-march-feature-drop-with-new-tweaks">updated the Pixel Camera app with version 9.8</a> to include that distinction in the settings menu. Google also created a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/333404495/take-hands-free-photos-with-pixel’s-palm-timer?hl=en&sjid=8147400953716585836-NA" target="_blank">community post</a> this week to explain the feature and reinforce the point that it works with multiple cameras.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Palm Timer is a Pixel-exclusive feature that can automatically start a photo timer when you show your palm to the camera. It was originally introduced with the front-facing camera and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> in mind, but now works with the Pixel 6 and newer, and with both cameras.</p><p>It's easy to see that Palm Timer works with the front-facing camera, since users get visual confirmation in the viewfinder. Even though there's no visual cue that a Palm Timer photo was taken using the rear cameras on a non-foldable, Google wants to point out that it does indeed work.</p>

<p>"Say goodbye to awkward selfie sticks and the stress of racing to beat the timer. With Google Pixel's Palm timer, you can easily capture everyone in your selfies or your group from a distance," the community post explains. "Not only does it work with the front camera, but you can also use it with the rear camera. When you’re ready, simply raise your palm to start the countdown. Easy peasy!"</p><p>Google says that to start a Palm Timer, simply hold up your hand toward the camera. A waving motion will do the trick, and when you're ready, lower your hand to start a timer. This is a way to initiate a photo on your Pixel phone without physically pressing the shutter button, so it's great for when your Pixel is set on a flat surface or tripod far away.</p><p>Palm Timer is enabled by default, but it can be disabled by opening the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-camera-renamed-pixel-camera">Pixel Camera</a> app. From there, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>More settings</strong> > <strong>Palm timer</strong>. There, you can turn it off if you'd like.</p>

<ul><li>Google Meet is changing the default layout options for large meetings to get more people involved.</li><li>Dynamic layouts now automatically crop tiles to get rid of background space and fit more tiles.</li><li>You can now pin up to six tiles on your Google Meet layout, up from three previously.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">major Google Meet update</a> this month that adds new layout options for large meetings, it announced today in a Google Workspace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/dynamic-layouts-for-google-meet.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The update adds a feature called "Dynamic layouts," which uses AI to identify faces and eliminate unwanted backgrounds using two new tile types: portrait tiles and dynamic tiles.</p><p>Anyone can use portrait tiles, which Google says will "prioritize faces by cropping out excess background video." This means you can fit more faces on a single layout. Portrait tiles also feature "optimized tile placement logic to enable much more efficient layouts that minimize unused space." In other words, Dynamic layouts use smart portrait tiles to get more people involved.</p><p>Google is also adding a tile type exclusive to Google Meet conference room hardware with Dynamic layouts. They're called dynamic tiles, which splits up video for people calling in from the same conference room into individual tiles.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lXwF95jY2I" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>"An individual video tile is created for up to 3 meeting participants joining from the same conference room with Google Meet hardware," the company explains. "AI-enabled active-speaker detection automatically highlights only the tile of the in-room speaker without any special hardware requirements."</p><p>Aside from the fact that dynamic tiles are split up using AI, they'll work just like any regular tile or portrait tile. That means you can pin a specific speaker to your layout individually, even if they are in the same room as other speakers. Previously, users would have to pin the entire conference room feed to their layout, and wouldn't be able to see individual speakers up close. This works for up to three people in the same conference room.</p><p>There are also new visual and user-interface changes. When a speaker's camera is off, their placeholder tile is now color-themed. Additionally, thanks to Dynamic layouts, Meet users can now pin up to six tiles to their layout — up from only three previously.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1484px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.40%;"><img id="HKspyi3NoxrdynNVfVpybh" name="Google-Meet-Dynamic-Layouts" alt="A demo of Dynamic layouts in Google Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKspyi3NoxrdynNVfVpybh.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1484" height="926" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dynamic layouts will become the default when they arrive for all Google Meet users. However, it's possible to manually switch back to legacy layouts in the layout options selection menu. Additionally, users can select <strong>Show my full video to others</strong> to prevent their camera feed from being cropped into a portrait tile for others.</p><p>Google says this may come in handy particularly for accessibility: "We encourage sign-language interpreters especially to consider using this feature to ensure that arms and hands are not unintentionally cropped out."</p><p>These features will begin to rollout for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/march-2025-workspace-feature-drop">Workspace</a> customers on rapid release domains starting March 31, 2025, and can take up to 15 days to appear for everyone. Scheduled release domains won't see these Meet upgrades until April 17, and it could take up to three weeks after that for them to appear for everyone. These upgrades are available for both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">paid and personal Workspace accounts</a>.</p>

<p>As for the keyboard folio covers, the Book Cover Keyboard Slim could cost €199 (about $215), and the standard Book Cover Keyboard might be priced at €269 (around $290).</p><p>While both will apparently come with an AI key, the standard version is said to stand out with a built-in trackpad. The Slim model reportedly ditches the trackpad and palm rest for a thinner, lighter design.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that the standard Galaxy Tab S10 FE may sport a 10.9-inch WUXGA+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate, while the Plus model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-fe-plus-leak-drops-and-suddenly-the-previous-model-looks-tiny">might go bigger with a 13.1-inch screen</a>.</p><p>Under the hood, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series is expected to run on the in-house Exynos 1580 chip, offering up to 256GB of storage. For cameras, you might be looking at a 13MP shooter on the back and a 12MP selfie cam up front.</p><p>Both tablets should support 45W wired charging, with the standard version housing an 8,000mAh battery and the Plus model bumping it up to 10,090mAh.</p><p>Samsung hasn’t confirmed a launch date yet, but with certifications and benchmarks popping up left and right, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series looks set to drop pretty soon.</p>

Gone are the days when Beats were promoting fashion over features and a bass-heavy sound signature.</p><p>I've tested every single Beats product released over the past two years, and they're not only excellent options for Apple users — they've also become some of the best price-to-performance audio products for Android fans as well. Now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-big-spring-sale-2025-best-deals-for-android">Amazon's Big Spring Sale is here</a>, we're seeing some of the best prices on Beats audio gear since Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p><p>Best of all, competing retailers like Best Buy and Target are getting in on the fun, often with better deals and promotions to challenge Amazon. That's why if you're in the market for new audio gear — whether it be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">headphones</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">earbuds</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">speakers</a> — there's a massively-discounted Beats product to choose from. After testing them all, I'm going to recommend the best Beats deal in each category.</p><p>If you act fast, you can save up to $100 on the latest Beats gear.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-headphone-deal-beats-solo-4-2">The best headphone deal: Beats Solo 4</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Cm9gJL9gxAsPucuvkmgjfJ" name="beats-solo-4-folded.jpg" alt="Beats Solo 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cm9gJL9gxAsPucuvkmgjfJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review">Beats Solo 4</a> aren't the best pair of headphones on the market, but you shouldn't sleep on them either. They're all about portability, ease-of-use, and battery life. With a collapsible design, you can fold them up and easily slide them into a bag for safe transport. Solo 4 also weigh just 217 grams, which is a minuscule amount compared to heavier pairs of headphones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/apples-usb-c-airpods-max-are-getting-an-upgrade-it-shouldve-had-all-along">like the 384.8-gram AirPods Max</a>.</p><p>This makes the Beats Solo 4 the perfect gym or on-the-go companion. Their on-ear design and strong clamping force means they won't fall off during your commute or workout, and at the same time, the soft cushions make Solo 4 comfortable.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a lightweight, versatile pair of wireless headphones lasting over 50 hours on a single charge.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need over-ear headphones with support for active noise-canceling and transparency mode.</p>
<p>For me, the killer features are the Beats Solo 4's versatility and battery life. These headphones last up to 50 hours on a single charge, which should last all week for workouts, commuting, and more. When the battery runs out, Solo 4 can actually run without power using the 3.5mm headphone jack. You have plenty of connectivity options here: 3.5mm wired, USB-C wired, or fast wireless pairing with iOS or Android.</p><p>Of course, there were some compromises made to hit this insane (now discounted even further) price point. The on-ear design may be less comfortable than over-ears for some, and there's no active noise-canceling or transparency mode here. The good news is that if you want all those features, the Beats Studio Pro have them, and they're also $170 off for a limited time. We <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/uh-is-this-a-joke-best-buy-carves-49-percent-off-my-favorite-noise-cancelling-headphones-from-beats">have a full breakdown of that deal here</a> if you want to learn more.</p><p>If you want the very best deal on the Beats Solo 4, Target is offering $100 off, but it requires creating a Target Circle account and going through a few hoops.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-earbud-deal-beats-studio-buds-plus-2">The best earbud deal: Beats Studio Buds Plus </h2>
<p>If you want a fully-featured pair of truly-wireless earbuds on a budget, look to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-studio-buds-plus-review">Beats Studio Buds Plus</a>. They're a revised version of the original Beats Studio Buds with better sound quality and features, inspired by the first-generation AirPods Pro. That's why the Studio Buds Plus are sure to sound great, with an in-ear design that pushes audio straight into your ears.</p><p>Another perk of the Beats Studio Buds Plus is that they're tiny, and that goes for both the earbuds and their charging case. The buds don't have any stems or hooks, so they'll sit nearly flush with your ear when nestled inside. Despite the tiny form factor, you'll get up to nine hours of battery life on a single charge with the earbuds and an additional 27 hours with the USB-C charging case.</p>

<p>On top of all that, you get fast pairing with both Android and iOS, and full support for customization and updates with the Beats app for Android. There's ANC and transparency mode support that'll help both block out unwanted noise and let in some of your surroundings.

<p>The Beats Pill isn't just a speaker. It's also a power bank, with a USB-C port for powering up other devices. You can use it as a beach or pool companion too, with an included lanyard and an IP67 dust and water-resistance rating. And as far as sound quality goes, there's new driver hardware for impressive and full audio with an angled design to push sound right toward your ears.</p><p>But the fantastic thing about the Beats Pill is its price. Right now, it's available for just $100 — that's $50 off its typical retail price. To put that in perspective, the Beats Pill's $149.99 retail price was already a discount. The Pill's predecessor, the Pill Plus, retailed for $230 when it released years ago. So, you're not only getting a better product for $80 less than the previous version — you're also saving $50 on top of that.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a portable Bluetooth speaker with great sound and long battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a wireless speaker with a 3.5mm audio jack.</p>
<p>There's really only one shortcoming of the Beats Pill, and that's the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack. However, you can use the included USB-C port for audio input and reverse charging, so it's an easy flaw to overlook. That's especially true if you plan to use the speaker wirelessly most of the time.</p><p>For just $99.99 for a limited time, I think most people will be stunned by how better their music sounds coming through the Beats Pill compared to their phone speakers. After all, this product is quite similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-roam-2-review">Sonos Roam 2</a> while costing nearly half the price with this discount.</p>

<p>For Android users, the biggest appeal of buying a Beats audio product is getting the latest Apple features in an Android-friendly package. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-vs-airpods-pro-2">AirPods Pro 2</a> or AirPods Max are some of the best headphones on the market, they're not fun to use with Android. By comparison, the Beats Solo 4, Beats Studio Buds Plus, and Beats Pill are all fully-featured on Android. In fact, some of them have Android-exclusive features.</p><p>It's worth noting that Beats' best competitor to the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, which aren't on sale yet — they just came out last month. With that being said, every single Beats product on this list is discounted to a fraction of the price of the Powerbeats Pro 2 ($250), so you aren't missing out.</p><p>If you're in the market for a new pair of headphones or earbuds, or even a Bluetooth speaker, there's a great Beats sale available. These deals won't last forever, so act now if you want to snag one of them.</p>

<p>Nothing’s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a> have a fancy AI button (Essential Key) tied into the Essential Space app. It currently powers tools like Camera Capture, but rumors suggest some AI perks might go premium in the future.</p><p>Currently, the Essential Key and its AI-powered Essential Space app are free to use for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a> users during its early access phase, but that might not last. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nothing-essential-space-subscription-3538293/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dug into the code and found hints that Nothing could be gearing up to charge $120 a year for access.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a> acts as a smart media hub, storing screenshots and recordings captured using the Essential Key button. Powered by AI, it organizes files, makes searching easy, and even generates notes, summaries, and to-do lists automatically.</p>

<h2 id="potential-paywall-2">Potential paywall</h2>
<p>Android Authority has uncovered mentions of "free trials" and "AI credits," hinting at a possible paywall. It looks like users might get a taste of certain features for free, but unlocking the full AI experience could require a subscription or buying credits.</p><p>Nothing is already teasing new tricks for the Phone 3a series, like "Flip to Record." It's a handy feature that starts voice recording when you place the phone face down.</p><p>A more profound look into the code hints at two upcoming Essential Space features: "Smart Collections" and "Focused Search." While they’re not live yet, the names suggest Smart Collections could auto-organize content, while Focused Search might offer AI-powered, deep device searches.</p>

<h2 id="one-year-trial-in-the-works-2">One-year trial in the works?</h2>
<p>Buried in the code, there's a mention of a "1 year free trial." This looks like it might only apply to certain new features when they drop instead of the whole Essential Space platform.</p><p>Just because these code hints exist doesn’t mean everything in Essential Space will go behind a paywall. Nothing might roll out a tiered system, keeping the basics free while charging for premium AI features.</p><p>The company has confirmed nothing yet, but the signs are there. Nothing told Android Authority that Essential Space is still in its free early access phase and that no pricing decisions have been made yet. However, the discovered code hints suggest the company is seriously weighing its monetization options.</p>

<ul><li>A few leaked Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE renders surfaced, suggesting the device will continue to rock a tab-like folder cover display design like the Flip 6.</li><li>The phone could see a 3.4-inch cover display with a dual camera array and a slightly smaller 6.7-inch internal screen.</li><li>Previous rumors have suggested a similar stagnant design; however, there is confusion about which Samsung SoC it could feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors look to end the week with an alleged look at Samsung's affordable clamshell foldable.</p><p>The supposed look at the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/exclusive-first-look-at-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-in-360-video-and-5k-renders/">SammyGuru</a> and X leaker OnLeaks. The leaked renderings showcase the phone in a minty green color from a few different angles. From the outside, the Flip 7 FE is suspected to debut with a familiar tab-like folder design for its cover display. Of course, this is reminiscent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. The cut in the display is to make room for the phone's dual camera array.</p><p>Beside those lenses is its LED flash, which echoes that past-gen model.</p><p>Rumors claim the phone will sport a 3.4-inch cover display around a 50MP lens and a 12MP camera. Samsung may continue to feature its "Armor Aluminum" frame around the edge of the phone. Opening it, the post suggests users will be greeted by a 6.7-inch screen. The renders also make it seem like the phone's internal bezels are quite thick, though they're not giving us the best look. These aren't confirmed looks at the phone, so there's a chance its internal screen's experience could look different than this.</p><p>What's more, speculation claims the device will see the following dimensions: 165.1 x 71.7 x 7.4mm. Everything else about the phone's design seems to retain the same design aspects as its flagship predecessor.</p>

<p>A few Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE renders <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-rendering-changes-specs-leaked">surfaced a month ago</a>, highlighting details similar to what's come up now. The latest rumors double down on the fact that the Flip 7 FE could mirror the Flip 6's design. Even the alleged camera array could remain the same as we've seen in 2024. There are a couple of key differences: the internal display size and the phone's thickness. It was previously stated the phone would rock a 6.8-inch screen, but that's gone down by 0.1 inches.</p><p>Additionally, rumors now claim the phone will be slightly thicker than its predecessor — which is odd considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-working-on-a-thin-galaxy-z-fold-phone-with-s-pen-support">Samsung's push</a> for thinner devices.</p><p>Rumors are divided about its SoC, with some rumors suggesting the Exynos 2500 while others <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">claim the Exynos 2400e</a>.</p><p>It's worth highlighting this continuation of the cover display's design as a recent flagship Galaxy Z Flip 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-galaxy-z-flip-7-case-leak-backs-larger-cover-display-rumor">rumor says it could go immersive</a>. The next flagship clamshell could boast an edge-to-edge 4-inch cover display, which reminds us of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Moto Razr Plus</a>.</p>

<p>Fitbit is reportedly providing an extension on its upcoming account merge; however, it also comes with a warning to its users about a risk of data loss if they don't comply.</p><p>In a new email from Fitbit, the company is now moving its Google Account merge deadline to February 2, 2026 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/28/fitbit-google-account-2026/">9to5Google</a>). With this, Fitbit says users have until this new date to merge their data from its platform to Google's, lest they incur a data wipe. The email states, "your account and data will be deleted," as well as all "historical data" previously stored by Fitbit.</p><p>The publication states users with "newer devices" (and likely new accounts) don't have to worry about this as this has likely already been done during the early setup stage.</p><p>If you've yet to migrate, head into the <strong>Fitbit app > Settings > Move Account</strong>. Ensure your app is up to date, as this option may not appear otherwise. Once there, the app will run you through everything you need to know/review before moving over.</p>

<p>After some hurdles, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-fitbit-acquisition-finally-complete">acquired Fitbit</a> for $2.1 billion in 2021. A year later, the company announced that it would soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-google-account-requirement">begin merging all of its data</a> with users' Google Accounts. The announcement said this change was to improve the user experience as you'd only have a "single login for Fitbit and other Google services, industry-leading account security, centralized privacy controls for Fitbit user data, and more features from Google on Fitbit."</p><p>The merge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-google-account-merge-summer">started in the summer of 2023</a>, and its original deadline was this year, 2025. Joining you in the merge will be your health and fitness history, as well as any wellness data. Security-wise, Google stated the merge should hopefully bring users peace of mind. Not only will its security act as the first line of defense, but you'll also have a range of privacy controls via the Privacy Center.</p><p>Users can manage all of their stored Fitbit data directly from their account's Privacy Center.</p><p>The latest Fitbit email is just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-google-account-transition">one of a few different ways</a> the company has been sending signals to keep its users aware of the merge. It's worth noting that if you don't merge your account, not only will your data get the boot, but you won't be able to access Fitbit's features, either. While you may have until February 2, 2026 to comply, it might be worth moving things over a little before then, just to be safe.</p>

That sounds a little ominous, considering everyone thinks Android is a completely open project. It's not. Android was never as open as you might think, and these changes aren't really a change.</p><p>Google is ultimately in charge of Android's code. Google decides what gets done, how it gets done, and when it gets done. You (or anyone) can contribute to Android, though. Once everything gets wrapped up, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">"finished" code</a> is posted for anyone to grab and use however they want.</p><p>In this way, Android is open. It uses liberal open-source licenses, which allow other companies like Samsung or Motorola to make changes and never have to share the work with us. You can make those kinds of changes, too, if you like. Please don't.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Android is open, but it's not as open as you think.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I asked for a public statement from a few Googlers who work on the Android project, but the folks I know well enough to ask can't give me one. Google has rules about who can share information and what they can share, and I don't blame them for it. Heck, they might not even know because big companies love to keep secrets.</p><p>According to the report, Google is supposed to make a formal announcement soon about the change, so we'll have to wait and see if there's any more to this news. But for now, it seems like much ado about nothing.</p><p>Going off the current report, nothing is really changing. You won't be able to look at submitted changes that aren't accepted, and you could never look at what was decided on until the code was released. Remember what I said about secrets? Don't worry, I'm about to explain.</p>

<p>There are two "main" versions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> right now, just as there were two versions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and there will be two versions of Android 17, too. I'm not talking about slight differences between tablets and phones or anything for wearables, etc, I'm talking about Android itself.</p><p>There is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/about/faqs#how-is-the-android-software-developed">main branch of Android 16</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/about/faqs#how-is-the-android-software-developed" target="_blank"> and an experimental branch</a>. The main branch is the one you can't see because it's developed by Google. It's also the branch that will be released as the next platform version, and when that happens, every single line will be posted for download. That won't be until Google is finished with Android 16, though.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1442px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:22.88%;"><img id="FRfBGrdxWjywWPxsmbYsAY" name="Android-16-Release-Schedule" alt="The beta release schedule for Android 16." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FRfBGrdxWjywWPxsmbYsAY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1442" height="330" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Android 16 release schedule. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the experimental branch. It's where things that may or may not work as intended are placed until the right people can figure out if they are needed and, if so, how they will be implemented. Right now, you can see a lot of it, but the latest says you won't be able to in the future. None of what you see here is part of Android, and it may never be.</p><p>Anyone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual">send a software patch to Google</a>, and those get placed in that experimental branch. A large number of these changes are ignored and never make it into an actual release. Working with Google is really no different than working with any other software company; they can't just merge dumb changes into the "finished" product.</p><p>The experimental branch of Android is nothing but a rumor mill. People see a change and tell others about it, and eventually, the rumor is that something will be coming in the next version of Android. This is what is going away.</p><p>I say adios and good riddance. Nobody working on building an actual version of Android that will run on a device pays any attention to the experimental branch. Neither should you.</p>

<p>What you really need to know is that for companies making phones, nothing changes because they often <em>do</em> get to peek at the "private" code before it is released. This goes for security patches as well as platform versions because doing the work once everything is made public means it would take far too long.</p><p>People who build ROMs (custom versions of Android) base their work on the current stable version of AOSP because they want all the non-open parts, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play</a>, to work with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-used-the-gemini-api-and-ai-studio-to-make-the-i-o-2025-puzzle">APIs</a> being used. Nobody wants to use a phone without third-party apps, and all those apps are written to work with the documented stable version of Android. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview" target="_blank">Especially Google's apps</a>.</p><p>If you've been an Android nerd for a long time and were an HTC fan, you might remember how I got hired here: I made custom ROMs and patched kernels for a lot of phones as a hobby and was willing to help people understand how they worked and how to get them installed.</p><p>It's not anything you can't do, and it's not difficult; it's just consuming. I still do it once in a while and remember why I stopped. Nobody is doing this and basing their work on the experimental branch of Android so they can make it harder.</p><p>What will <em>really</em> change is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/" target="_blank">Reddit rumor mill</a> and clickbait headlines on your favorite Android website — including this one. That's a good thing.</p>

<ul><li>Pixel Watches have reportedly gained a small, QoL update for tiles alongside the recent Wear OS 5.1 update.</li><li>Tiles now display a small circular app icon at the top "briefly," to help users keep tabs of everything.</li><li>The Wear OS 5.1 update started appearing in the March feature drop, two weeks ahead of LTE devices receiving it; however, the patch has caused major issues.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There's a little more in store for the latest major Wear OS update, which involves a small update for app awareness.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/25/wear-os-tile-icon/#more-666431">9to5Google</a>, the latest Wear OS 5.1 update makes its new app icon refinement more widespread on the company's Pixel Watch. The small update reportedly concerns Pixel Watch owners swiping through their set tiles on the watch face. Now, your device will display the icon of the app that the specific tile belongs to.</p><p>For example, the publication highlights the recorder tile, which shows the Recorder app's icon "briefly" at the top.</p><p>The icon is said to remain "out of the way," and it only seems to remain in view for a little while before disappearing. Curiously, the publication states this small QoL feature has been around for years, but it seems the most recent Wear OS 5.1 update brought it to devices more profoundly.</p>

<p>Google's Wear OS 5.1 update is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-1-kicks-off-new-update-strategy-for-pixel-watches">a new dawn</a> for the company's outlook on wearable software. The update, based on Android 15, first arrived for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-capable Pixel Watches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">in the March feature drop</a>. The patch was substantial for those devices as it finally brought the recently FDA-approved Loss of Pulse safety feature, menstraul cycle tracking, and step tracking improvements.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple of weeks later that Google finally brought that same update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/google-lte-pixel-watches-wear-os-5-1-rollout-spotted">to all LTE-capable</a> devices. Though it was late, owners of an LTE Pixel Watch, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Watch 3 grabbed a host of new features alongside upgraded media controls. The patch started rolling out roughly ten days ago today (Mar 28), so if you haven't gotten it yet, give it another check.</p><p>Unfortunately, though Wear OS 5.1 packs a lot of good, it's also been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-1-seems-to-have-come-with-multiple-bugs">causing a lot of frustrations</a>. The update has reportedly been delaying notifications and causing severe battery issues. Users have come together to voice these issues while stating a band-aid fix could be restarting or factory resetting the affected watch. Google finally chimed in and informed Android Central that they're aware of the problems impacting "a very small number of Pixel Watch users."</p>

<p>The<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/pixel-9a-arrives-with-a-fresh-new-look"> Google Pixel 9a launched </a>on Mar. 19, and we were taken by surprise when the tech giant didn't give us information on preorders or in-store launch dates. Now, ten days later, the company announced that the budget phones will be out in stores starting April 10.</p><p>Google usually makes all its devices available for pre-orders on launch day, but for the Pixel 9a, we were told that it would show up in stores "sometime in April" without a concrete date. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-does-the-right-thing-by-delaying-pixel-9a-pre-orders">There's a good reason why </a>Google wanted to hold back preorders; it said the first Pixel 9a units had a "component quality issue" and that it wanted to make sure that the phone was functioning as it was supposed to before being released to the masses.</p>

<p>Debuting at $499 in two new colorways: Iris and Peony, the Pixel 9a comes with the fastest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip, gets up to 30 plus hours of battery life, and can do almost everything that the standard Pixel 9 phone can.</p><p>Right off the bat, the Pixel 9a sports an all-new look, ditching its usual pill-shaped camera bump and housing the rear cameras within the phone. For its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch pOLED screen. Like the other Pixel 9 devices, this budget phone also gets Android 15 out of the box and seven years of OS and security updates. The phone comes with all the latest AI features, including Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor, and more.</p><p>Lastly, Google didn't mention when users can start pre-ordering the Pixel 9a, but anyone interested can hit the "get notified" button on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_9a?utm_source=keyword&utm_medium=google_oo&utm_campaign=GS108173&hl=en-GB&utm_medium=google_oo&utm_campaign=GS108173&utm_medium=google_oo&utm_campaign=GS108173" target="_blank">the Google Store </a>to be the first to know when the phone will be available online.</p>

Still, if you&apos;re like me and you&apos;ve had your eye on the Beoplay H95 for a while, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-Comfortable-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B099RPKBB7"><strong>you&apos;ll be stoked to learn that the premium cans have received a straight 20% discount during Amazon&apos;s Big Spring Sale</strong></a>, amounting to $200 of savings. </p><p>This discount totally clobbers the Bang & Olufsen deals that we saw during Black Friday/Cyber Monday last fall, and you&apos;ll even get a free protective case with your purchase. Even with the discount, can the Danish audio company really justify charging $700 for a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a>? I&apos;ve personally been saving my pennies for just such an occasion, so my answer is a resounding <em>yes</em>. </p>

<p>Ready for a new pair of wireless headphones? The Beoplay H95 by Bang & Olufsen are an audiophile's dream, with outstanding sound quality, a luxurious build, and reliable battery life. The only real problem I have with these headphones is the price, but thanks to this 20% discount during Amazon's Big Spring Sale, making the purchase is a much easier pill to swallow. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-Comfortable-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B099RPKBB7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e8f6a4a5-e239-4c37-bdee-7cfee427376a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>If you&apos;re serious about audio, the Beoplay H95 headphones are like a work of art, constructed entirely from titanium, leather, and memory foam to ensure a luxurious feel and absurdly comfy fit. The titanium build extends to the 40mm drivers with LDAC codec support, delivering crystal clear, immersive sound regardless of genre. If the presets aren&apos;t working for you, you can also easily fine-tune your EQ settings in the companion Bang & Olufsen app. </p><p>Furthermore, the premium headphones boast active noise cancellation, spatial audio support, and up to 50 hours of battery life on a single charge (or 38 hours when ANC is activated). Your purchase even comes with a free hard-shell protective case.</p><p>Of course, the Beoplay H95 aren&apos;t for everyone. There&apos;s basically no water resistance here, the price is still too high, and vegans should look elsewhere to avoid the leather construction (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> are a great-sounding, cheaper alternative). </p><p>If you just want a versatile pair of headphones to take on a jog, these aren&apos;t them, but if your idea of a good time is settling into a comfy chair and listening to your favorite album, then these Bang & Olufsen headphones are an amazing choice. </p>

<p>After Lenovo and Samsung debuted their latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> last year, I figured we would be in store for big things in 2025. Fast forward to now, as we're almost three full months into the year, and there really hasn't been much going on.</p><p>Sure, ChromeOS is still being updated at its regular cadence, and there are a few rumors here and there. CES came and went, and HP even announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/hp/hp-announces-dozens-of-new-ai-pcs">more than 20 new devices</a> at its Amplify conference, none of which are powered by ChromeOS. Instead, what we've seen so far is an updated Acer Chromebook Plus 515, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.acer.com/en-us/acer-chromebook-spin-312-cp312-1hn-34z7">Chromebook Spin 312</a>, and the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 2-in-1. That's about it.</p>

<p>Our friends over at Chrome Unboxed have been keeping an eye on a few things, such as a Lenovo Chromebook powered by the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/upcoming-mediatek-mt8196-chromebook-navi-will-have-a-16-inch-4k-screen/">MediaTek MT8196</a>" and a potential ASUS Chromebook that is codenamed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/asus-just-might-be-building-skywalker-with-the-mediatek-mt8189-inside/">Skywalker</a>." But those have yet to arrive, and we aren't really sure just how much of a splash either of those would make. There's definitely potential, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/mediateks-mt8196-could-power-the-fastest-chromebooks-ever-made/">MT8196</a> said to match up with the Dimensity 9400 and the Lenovo "Navi" Chromebook potentially shipping with a "16-inch 4K screen."</p><p>None of this is to say that we necessarily <em>need</em> a fresh crop of Chromebooks. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review">Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714</a> are nestled nicely at the top of the food chain. Then, there are a bunch of options as you move further down the price tiers, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11</a> offering the best ChromeOS tablet experience out there.</p><p>At the same time, it's been just about six months since the Galaxy Chromebook Plus and Duet 11 were introduced. That's a long time with what feels like radio silence, and of the ones that we have seen, they're mostly just spec refreshes.</p>

<p>It's almost impossible to point to one specific reason as to why companies have slowed the release schedule down. But I do think a couple of factors are at play, starting with Samsung's re-entry into the Chromebook space.</p><p>For a few years, we saw Acer, HP, Lenovo, and others come in and enjoy time in the spotlight. However, seeing as Google worked with Samsung to introduce the first Chromebook with the new Quick Insert Key, I have to wonder if there isn't some animosity. Since the release of the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, we've yet to see the dedicated key make its way to other Chromebooks.</p><p>Google introduced the "Launcher + F" keyboard combination for everyone when it released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-130-chromebook-plus-update-rollout">ChromeOS M130</a> in late 2024. Even still, it just feels a bit odd that Google kind of left all of the other OEMs out to dry, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-google-partnership-and-the-android-ecosystem">giving Samsung yet another exclusive</a>. It's the same kind of feeling that I had when Samsung and Google teamed up for the Wear OS 3 revamp. Okay, maybe it's not exactly the same, but it's pretty close.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BdbksaFDrmnYwftw36ydhc" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-6.jpg" alt="Close up on keyboard and left ports on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BdbksaFDrmnYwftw36ydhc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another prospective reason for why we haven't seen any new Chromebooks could be that they've kind of peaked. ChromeOS isn't meant to do as much as macOS or Windows, and unless you're savvy (or just like to tinker), the majority of people won't even know that you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-and-run-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook">Linux apps</a>.</p><p>So, does it really make sense for Chromebooks to be continuously released on a yearly cadence when the underlying hardware is basically overkill? We all joke about how much memory Chrome eats on our computers, but that's not as much of an issue on ChromeOS. The majority of Chromebook buyers are probably fine with 4GB of RAM, although I'd argue that we're long past the time when 8GB should be the new minimum.</p><p>Then again, not everyone has 30+ tabs open, along with a bunch of apps at any given time. I just need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/framework-laptop-chromebook-edition-review">Framework</a> to release a new ChromeOS mainboard so I can have as much RAM and storage as I want. But I digress.</p>

<h2 id="is-a-pixel-laptop-coming-2">Is a Pixel Laptop coming?</h2>
<p>Something else that I've had rattling around in my head is the idea stemming from the rumors of Google working on a "Pixel Laptop." Instead of being powered by ChromeOS, which would make sense, it would rely on Android. I'm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/dropping-chromeos-for-android-on-pixel-laptop-doesnt-make-sense">not convinced</a> this is anything other than Google trying to come up with different ideas and implementations.</p><p>However, Google has been making some rather massive strides in improving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16" target="_blank">desktop mode</a> that lay dormant within Android for years. Maybe the rumored Pixel Laptop wasn't ever a consumer device and instead provided Google with a "playground" of sorts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uwJAr3eBYGfiL5nPSJAZGZ" name="new-button-terminal-app-pixel-9-pro-fold-2" alt="New button in the Terminal app on Pixel 9 Pro Fold running Android 16 Beta 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwJAr3eBYGfiL5nPSJAZGZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not to mention that there's now a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-2-is-here-with-our-first-look-at-the-working-linux-terminal-app">Linux terminal app</a> built into Pixel phones, in addition to rumors that Google is working on bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/desktop-chrome-android-extensions-3488455/">extensions</a> to the Chrome mobile app. The puzzle pieces seem like they're starting to slot into place, but we're still only working with the edge. So what does ChromeOS have to do with all of this?</p><p>Short tangent aside, we forget that Google already had a working implementation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-let-you-run-chromeos-on-android-one-day">ChromeOS running on a Pixel phone</a>. Apparently this was never actually going to be released, but in November 2024, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-should-look-to-microsoft-if-the-pixel-laptop-comes-to-fruition">rumor</a> suggested Google was gearing up to "migrate ChromeOS fully over to Android."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="ynAJPPqk947Q6EtweoQ2SL" name="acer-chromebox-cxi5-review-1.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebox CXI5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ynAJPPqk947Q6EtweoQ2SL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Such a move would allow Google to provide a more fluid and natural experience on devices with larger screens, such as tablets and maybe even foldables. However, you could also, in theory, connect your phone to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-docking-stations-chromebooks">docking station</a>, along with some peripherals, plug everything into an external display, and have essentially the same experience as a Chromebook.</p><p>At the same time, this move could potentially spell the end of Chromebooks as we know them. I don't think anything drastic will happen with regard to the education segment, as there's just too much money for Google to scoop up. However, consumer Chromebooks could eventually be replaced by our phones, which could explain how we find ourselves in the current situation.</p><p>The truth is that while it's fun for me to sit here and act like I can figure out what Google has planned, I have no idea what's actually going to happen. This could just be me trying to put pieces together for a puzzle that doesn't exist.</p><p>But to me, it's like the old saying goes, "Where there's smoke, there's fire." Clearly, Google is up to <em>something</em>, and I'd be willing to bet we'll learn more in less than two months when Google I/O takes place.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's rolling out some additional Gemini aid to its navigational app; however, it seems there's room for improvement.</p><p>Alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-ask-about-place-3537852/">Android Authority</a>, social media tipster AssembleDebug spotted Google rolling out a new "Ask about place" suggestion chip in Maps. The demo highlights the user's ability to surface Gemini when in Maps and tap the new chip directly above the text field. From there, users can enter a question about the place before submitting. The AI will run through its normal processes before returning an answer to your query.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will confirm that it's discovered the place you've selected in Maps, as well as offer a set of directions for you. This is delivered via a tappable link in the app. Moreover, Gemini delivers additional pieces of information like the place's location, an approximation of how long it'd take to get there, and more.</p><p>What's strange is that even though Google has started rolling this "Ask about place" chip out officially, the publication claims it's not working a hundred percent of the time.</p><p>The feature has reportedly been spotted for "most points of interest," but for those that Gemini can't fulfill, it will let you know. There's speculation Google might shove certain aspects of Gemini's involvement with Maps behind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini Advanced</a>. Nothing's been confirmed anywhere yet, so perhaps this is more of a test run than reality for the app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="zazUzHBrUw7AnckDHypNyW" name="google-maps-gemini-chip-returned-demo" alt="Google Maps was seen rolling out a Gemini-based chip that lets users "Ask about place."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zazUzHBrUw7AnckDHypNyW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the way Gemini's new chip works in Maps echoes an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-update-automatically-starts-google-maps-navigation">update Google rolled out</a> for its app last year. Receiving directions from Gemini for Maps a year prior was a little tiring, as users were left interacting with links. After the change, Gemini would conduct all of its work through your attached Maps extension, providing a card similar to the "Ask about place" chip we're seeing reported today.</p><p>Additionally, the AI model would automatically take users into Maps with the delivered set of directions, ready to get going. In Gemini, this is all done by saying "Navigate to [place]" or "Take me to [x]." Most of this has rolled over into the AI's chip in Maps; however, it seems like users are still required to hit the provided link before directions can be delivered.</p><p>It's an odd reversion, but there's a chance Google is still going through the motions with it.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps/google-maps-might-predict-more-than-just-the-traffic">a more recent Maps update</a> was spotted in development, which involves the app becoming more user-friendly. The app could give users more information at a glance, like available parking, fuel efficiency, and ETA. This will all seemingly be delivered to users in the initial window after users set their desired destination in the app.</p>

That's why I fell in love with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/you-should-buy-flip-phone-black-friday">modern flip phones</a>.</p><p>After trying both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Moto Razr</a>, the choice for me was easy — Moto all day. The front screen is simply a lot more useful and what's the point of having a front screen if it's not? I picked up mine while it was on sale, and since it's on sale again, now is a great time for you to pick up yours!</p>

While federal judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín gave Samsung until late April to file an amended complaint, there isn't much legal leeway. And this ruling is a reminder that Samsung aside, the smart ring industry remains in legal limbo even as things <em>appear</em> normal.</p><p>Last summer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-sues-oura-to-prevent-galaxy-ring-patent-challenge">Samsung preemptively sued Oura</a>, arguing that "Oura's pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement" against smart ring brands like Ultrahuman, Circular, and RingConn was an "actual, imminent risk to Samsung" and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p><p>The March 27 ruling — spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ipfray.com/judge-throws-out-samsungs-declaratory-judgment-action-against-oura-as-no-patent-enforcement-was-specifically-threatened-samsung-may-try-again/">ip fray</a>'s Florian Mueller and shared with Android Central — shows Martínez-Olguín argue that Oura's general statements about enforcing its patents "were not directed at Samsung" and "do not reveal a likelihood or intent to enforce Oura’s patents against Samsung."</p><p>Oura only reserved the right to "take the action that's appropriate." It <em>may</em> decide that means suing Samsung, but Samsung lacks standing to argue future harm to its business without anything concrete.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3752px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Wb9oyrF5LEDLoYMfLh6SJH" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) next to the Galaxy Watch 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wb9oyrF5LEDLoYMfLh6SJH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3752" height="2111" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung can refile the suit, but only with "allegations that predate the filing of the initial complaint," and we don't know of any overt threats Oura made against Samsung before <em>or</em> after the Galaxy Ring launch.</p><p>Mueller argues in his analysis that Samsung's lawsuit successfully hampered Oura's legal action until some of its patents were "rendered moot" due to statutory limitations. He also believes Samsung may try to amend its complaint or appeal the dismissal, even without a "smoking gun," to forestall Oura from suing in another district like East Texas.</p><p>Samsung's stalling gambit has given the Galaxy Ring almost a year of unimpeded sales. But if this ruling eventually clears the way for Oura to sue, it could interfere with the hypothetical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">Galaxy Ring 2</a> or later models.</p><p>Of course, as this ruling states, there's no <em>proof</em> that Oura will sue Samsung after this. And we're still waiting to see how the other top smart ring brands will fare in their own Oura patent infringement lawsuits. We've reached out to Samsung for comment on this ruling and will update the post if we hear back.</p>

<p>In March 2024, Oura <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-files-itc-action-for-patent-infringement">filed</a> an International Trade Commission (ITC) action against Circular, RingConn, and Ultrahuman, stating they had "no choice" but to legally challenge brands that "imitate and ride the coattails of our innovation" through patent infringement.</p><p>A month later, the ITC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usitc.gov/press_room/news_release/2024/er0412_65060.htm">announced</a> a Section 337 investigation, indicating Oura had asked for a "limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders" that would essentially ban these brands from sale in the United States.</p><p>A year later, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ids.usitc.gov/case/8183/investigation/8536">investigation page</a> still shows as "Pending before the Administrative Law Judge," with the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usitc.gov/secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1398_notice12232024sgl.pdf">notice</a> in December 2024 indicating that certain aspects of the case are still being amended. There's no way to know how long it'll take or how the change in U.S. administration will affect the ruling, but the case hasn't gone away.</p>

<p>Frankly, it's easy to forget how fragile the smart ring industry is at this moment. Smart ring sales were under a million in 2023 and should climb to 2.5 million in 2025, per IDC predictions shared with Android Central. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">top smart ring brands</a> keep releasing new models and signs point to strong sales.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-will-add-ecg-readings-and-8-day-battery-life-at-a-cost">Circular Ring 2</a> is at $1.6 million and climbing for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/circular-ring/circular-ring-2-worlds-most-advanced-health-tracking-ring">Kickstarter</a>, promising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-heart-health-glucose-trends-annoucement">blood pressure and glucose readings</a>. Ultrahuman sells <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-rare-luxury-smart-ring-with-premium-materials-massive-price">luxury smart rings</a> and constantly updates its Ring Air with new "Powerplug" features. RingConn launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">Gen 2 ring</a> last year and the Gen 2 Air this month.</p><p>Unless you pay close attention to legal filings, you'd have no idea that the smart ring industry could come to a crashing halt if Oura proves that most of its competitors infringe on its ideas.</p><p>And those ideas keep coming! While researching possible designs for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-5">Oura Ring 5</a>, I found dozens of Oura patents filed in 2025 alone and hundreds more before that, ranging from new one-size-fits-all design ideas to more outlandish tricks like unlocking or controlling your car with your Oura Ring.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KMbUhCn4bUehTLkmfqKTya" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-inside-close.jpg" alt="Looking at the electronics on the inside of the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMbUhCn4bUehTLkmfqKTya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has its own patented ideas for the Galaxy Ring 2, like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/next-galaxy-ring-could-come-with-sensors-to-measure-body-and-surface-temperatures" target="_blank">outer temperature sensor</a> to detect if you have a fever, gesture controls for other connected devices like a laptop or tablet, or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-resizing-patent-discovered" target="_blank">resizable design</a> that'll morph into your finger size.</p><p>It also has more resources than startup brands like Circular and Ultrahuman, which could make it a tougher opponent for Oura to battle in the courts. Still, even Apple had to reckon with a potential watch recall over the Masimo blood oxygen patent dispute, and Samsung has already lost one legal fight.</p><p>Ultimately, no matter which smart ring brand you wear or are interested in, you may want to pay close attention to Oura's ITC case and the likely follow-up to Samsung's counter-suit. The smart ring legal war should only keep heating up.</p>

<ul><li>The AYANEO Pocket ACE has been officially announced.</li><li>It features a 4.5-inch LCD display with a 3:2 aspect ratio and a 1620 x 1080 resolution.</li><li>The Pocket ACE is powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, the same SoC as the Pocket S, EVO, and DMG.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It's been quite a busy month for AYANEO, as the company kicked things off by unveiling the Pocket Micro Classic. That was followed up by a joint announcement with Qualcomm where several new devices and handhelds were announced. Now, AYANEO is closing the month out with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ayaneo.com/article/878">Pocket ACE</a>.</p><p>The company actually began teasing the ACE right after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneos-latest-gaming-handheld-is-a-true-homage-to-the-game-boy-micro">Micro Classic</a> was announced. However, we're only now learning more about what this latest Android gaming handheld has to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7XZbXF7xYb6JN75fNbTJ2Z" name="ayaneo-pocket-ace-announced-3" alt="All three AYANEO Pocket ACE Colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7XZbXF7xYb6JN75fNbTJ2Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6820" height="3836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you like the idea of a retro handheld but want something more portable than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-evo-pre-orders">Pocket EVO</a>, then the 4.5-inch Pocket ACE might be the one for you. AYANEO is using an LCD panel, complete with a 1620 x 1080 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio.</p><p>There was something I noticed about the Pocket ACE, and that it's design looked kind of familiar. It took a few minutes, but then I realized that the Pocket ACE looks fairly similar to the Retroid Pocket 2S.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M3aEV7eqSD2pqc3WMqe6w6" name="retroid-pocket-2s-minecraft.jpg" alt="Minecraft on Retroid Pocket 2S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M3aEV7eqSD2pqc3WMqe6w6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, it's not <em>exactly</em> the same, but it's pretty darn close. And while the Pocket 2S was one of my favorite handhelds, it was just a bit too small for me. I'm hoping that the Pocket ACE will be able to help me avoid hand cramps even when playing games for longer sessions.</p>

<p>At the helm is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/snapdragon-g-series-chips">Snapdragon G3x Gen 2</a>, making this the most powerful handheld at this size that we've seen. And even with that amount of horsepower, we're hoping the Pocket ACE will last for days thanks to the 6,000mAh battery. Plus, there's 40W fast charging onboard to get you juiced back up to 100% in no time.</p><p>Notably, AYANEO's main focus isn't on how powerful it is, but instead, it is that the Pocket ACE is the "first retro handheld with a 0916B flagship-grade linear motor." The company claims this will deliver "realistic, nuanced vibrations...deepening immersion."</p>

<p>So far, it looks like AYANEO might have another winner on its hands. Some bits of information have yet to be shared about the Pocket ACE, including RAM, storage, and of course, the price.</p><p>Nevertheless, you can head over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ace-most-powerful-horizontal-retro-handheld/">Indiegogo campaign page</a> and sign up to be notified when the Pocket ACE goes live. AYANEO is offering a $10 discount for those who sign up, which will come in the form of a "secret perk" that will be emailed to you. Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long before being able to get our hands on this.</p>

For one, Amazon has slashed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D79QCMF5" target="_blank"><strong>22% off the price of the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</strong></a> as part of its Big Spring Sale, representing $50 in savings and bringing them back down to their lowest price ever.</p><p>The second-generation Pixel Buds Pros are definitely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds#section-best-for-pixel-users">best earbuds for Pixel users</a>, but they're also just solid all-around. Google upgraded a lot of features from the previous generation, including the addition of a more powerful chipset for better audio and active noise cancellation. These tiny earbuds also rock a decent battery life with the charging case, and the buds themselves also come in four cute colors: peony, hazel, porcelain, and wintergreen.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're a Pixel device user and you're looking for a good deal on wireless earbuds; you prefer smaller earbuds; you want cross-platform access to Google Gemini and Gemini Advanced features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you aren't in the Pixel ecosystem and you'd rather go with a different brand; you're looking for an even cheaper price point than this discount; you don't like small earbuds.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds</a> are a huge improvement from the company's previous iteration. For one, they come with an upgraded Tensor A1 chip, offering even better ANC quality and audio overall. They also include integrated Google Gemini and Gemini Advanced features for those who want the latest in conversational AI digital assistants.</p><p>Battery life in our tests reached around eight hours per charge while using ANC, and up to 12 without it. When using the case, Google says users can get up to 30 hours with intermittent charging, and it takes just about five minutes of charging to get an hour and a half of playback time.</p><p>Pixel 6 owners and later will get the most out of these earbuds, while, unfortunately, A series phones will only get limited access the wide range of features. Also, those who prefer a larger earbud fit for the shape of their ears may struggle with these, as they really are pretty small.</p>

<p>Oppo is gearing up for a new launch event in China next month, wherein the company will be announcing a bunch of new products under the popular Find X8 series, including the Find X8 Ultra, the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>.</p><p>The company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/1710173801">started teasing the launch date</a> set for April 10 — on Weibo accounts alongside Oppo Find series product manager Zhou Yi Bao, who also seems to be revealing important insights into the upcoming new phones. The teaser images indicate that we should be seeing Hasselblad integration staying intact with the Find X8 Ultra.</p>

<p>The device is all set to take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">latest flagships</a> in the market again with its two periscopic telephoto cameras. In the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1710173801/PkkjM0Zvw">Weibo post</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Find-X8-Ultra-Oppo-details-3x-and-6x-optical-camera-upgrades-ahead-of-time.987420.0.html">Notebookcheck</a>), Oppo has confirmed that it has improved light intake on both the sensors, wherein the 3x periscopic lens manages to gain 150% light intake and the 6x lens increases light intake by 251% — when compared to the predecessor Find X7 Ultra.</p><p>Very recently, Bao has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/Pk06ZusqG">shared a photo shot</a> of the upcoming flagship Find X8 Ultra and compared the same shot taken by the latest iPhone 16 Pro. When put side by side, the Oppo phone has managed to outshine the iPhone 16 Pro as the shot was captured in a darker environment. The red neon lighting in the photo is bright red as seen on the X8 Ultra, whereas the iPhone turned it orange.</p>

<p>Similarly, the person’s avatar is seen in blue on the iPhone 16 Pro, whereas in the Find X8 Ultra, the person is more clear and real, as noted by Bao, and all thanks to Ultra’s night portrait professional lens alongside a new Danxia color lens.</p><p>Bao has further confirmed that along with the Find X8 Ultra, the company is also announcing two new Find X8s series phones on April 10. The Find X8s will have a 6.3-inch display, whereas the Find X8s Plus comes with a 6.59-inch panel. Both phones are believed to be carrying a lighter form factor yet having a strong build and a large glacier battery capacity.</p>

<p>Other expected product launches from the upcoming event include Oppo Watch X2 Mini and Oppo Pad 4 Pro. It is still unclear whether the Find X8 Ultra launch is limited to China or global markets would witness the handset as well, because previous Ultra iterations were limited to China.</p>

As part of the Amazon Big Spring Sale, the retailer has cut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLFH7CCV"><strong>23% off the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus</strong>,</a> bringing the price down to only $170.</p><p>This particular deal is for the configuration with just 64GB of storage, though Samsung also offers a 128GB version if you need more. The A9 Plus sports an 11-inch LCD display, 4GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon 695 chipset that offers impressive performance for this price point. To be sure, this little device is no match for mid-range and premium tablets, though there's more than one reason why it's our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets#section-best-cheap-tablet">best cheap Samsung tablet</a> out there.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="af3386a0-50b4-43ff-a063-009a801971c2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 64GB:" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 64GB:" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLFH7CCV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="rUNyvTLboDppMEkJGRiNGo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A9-Plus-screen.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rUNyvTLboDppMEkJGRiNGo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 64GB:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLFH7CCV" target="_blank" data-dimension112="af3386a0-50b4-43ff-a063-009a801971c2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 64GB:" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 64GB:" data-dimension25=""> <del>$219.99</del> <strong>$169.99 for Amazon's Big Spring Sale</strong></a></p><p>As Amazon's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-big-spring-sale-2025-best-deals-for-android">Big Spring Sale</a> nears its end on March 31st, the company is offering a $50 discount on the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, which also happens to be our favorite affordable Samsung tablet. Beyond this extra-low price tag, the A9 Plus is a great lightweight tablet with impressive performance and a battery life that puts many rivals to shame.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLFH7CCV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="af3386a0-50b4-43ff-a063-009a801971c2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 64GB:" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 64GB:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you like having a lightweight tablet that's easy to carry around with you; you have other devices in the Galaxy ecosystem that you like.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for high-powered performance; you want something with an AMOLED display; you need more than 128GB of storage.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus is an affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> already, sporting a basic Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 CPU, an 11-inch LCD display, and 8MP rear and 5MP front cameras. This deal is for the 64GB storage configuration, though it also comes with a microSD port for up to 1TB of expandable storage. Users also like the tablet's quad speakers, USB-C charging, and the screen's 90Hz refresh rate.</p><p>While it certainly shouldn't be confused with some of Samsung's higher-end S tablets in either performance or display quality, the A9 Plus is still a good pick if you need something for kids, an extra smart home screen, or simple tasks that don't require a more powerful device.</p><p>With all of these things considered, the A9 Plus offers a pretty impressive experience for the price point, let alone with an extra $50 in savings.</p>

<p>I thought I could use a dumbphone for 24 hours as a working adult, but it turns out that's impossible in the modern era. However, I found that the vibrant HMD Barbie Phone is suitable for young children and pre-teen kids.</p><p>The Barbie Phone is basically a revamped version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-kaios-powered-nokia-2780-flip-is-the-phone-i-wish-i-could-use">Nokia 2780 Flip</a>, which is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-dumb-phone">best dumbphone</a> on the market. Both devices are powered by KaiOS instead of Android, lack touchscreens, and have other limitations that categorize them as "dumb" phones. This isn't all bad, and you still get the basic functions of a mobile phone along with some perks.</p><p>The software limitations serve as excellent parental controls while still enabling communication between guardians and their wards. Since KaiOS is much lighter than Android, it doesn't need a ton of memory to run smoothly. This means that even with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage, the Barbie Phone doesn't lag or stutter. You can always expand the memory up to 32GB via microSD later if needed.</p>

<p>Children adore bright colors, so it's a given that the littles will love this overwhelmingly pink phone. HMD Global partnered with Mattel to deliver the funkiest, grooviest, and most fun packaging I've seen for a phone. The HMD Barbie Phone comes inside a pale pink velvet-lined box with a plethora of accessories.</p><p>Your kid can knock themselves out customizing their Barbie phone. There are stickers in the box, replaceable backs for the phone, a beaded lanyard, a handful of cutesy charms, and gems to bedazzle the device as well.</p><p>The wide range of accessories included in the set encourages children to express their individuality.</p>

<p>HMD Global includes a bubblegum pink USB-C charger and cable in the box, as well as a pink microfiber cloth for wiping the mirror on the front. That's right, the front of the flip phone has a real mirror with a tiny LED screen built-in. The screen showcases the time, charging information, and notifications.</p>
<h2 id="thoughtfully-crafted-design-and-software-2">Thoughtfully crafted design and software</h2>
<p>While the Nokia 2780 Flip has the Kai Store with HTML5 apps like Facebook and YouTube, HMD Global intentionally omitted social media from the Barbie Phone, with the exception of an email app.</p><p>The reason for this, according to HMD Global, is to keep the device non-intrusive by removing distracting apps. You only get basics like calls and text messages, Wi-Fi, and LTE connectivity on the device, which is why I feel it's an excellent phone for younger kids.</p><p>Pre-teens whose parents feel they aren't ready for social media and instant connection with the world still need to be on the grid. The Barbie Phone enables that in a safe and seamless method. It's an excellent "first" phone for a child, preparing them for the responsibility of having a full-blown phone as well.</p><p>It's not a boring phone either, with plenty of engaging games, an FM radio, and a music player. There are useful pre-loaded apps like a clock, calendar, to-do list, and voice recorder. There's even a flashlight, a headphone jack, and a single 5MP camera that shoots amicable pictures.</p>

<p>There's a customizable Barbie button on the keypad, which opens the camera app initially.</p><p>Typing on the old school keypad takes some getting used to, especially for younger generations who never had to use such phones ever before. The pink plastic buttons are easy to click and you get the hang of it pretty quickly.</p><p>I'm glad that this concept lives on in dumbphones, reviving and sustaining the nostalgia of the physical numpad.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-a-small-price-to-pay-for-a-great-quality-product-2">It's a small price to pay for a great quality product</h2>
<p>HMD Global offers an insanely good price for the Barbie Phone. You can buy it unlocked for about $129.99, often discounted to $99.99 at various retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.</p><p>Buying it locked is a smart idea too, as the cell plan from most carriers is filthy cheap. The HMD Barbie Phone works on all U.S. networks, CDMA and GSM alike. Certain MVNOs like Consumer Cellular offer a great deal with plans <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.consumercellular.com/shopping/details/barbie_phone">starting at just $20 a month</a>, which is super affordable.</p><p>Giving a full-blown smartphone to kids isn't a smart idea for countless reasons. More often than not, the cons far outweigh the pros, leaving parents to turn to alternatives like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kids' smartwatches</a> and dumbphones instead.</p><p>Few phones are built from the ground up with children in mind. Most brands take pre-existing models and tweak them to make them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-kids">suitable for kids or teenagers</a> by bolstering privacy and security, and adding stricter parental controls.</p><p>A lot of thought goes into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-choose-the-right-phone-for-your-child">choosing a phone for a child</a>. If you're not keen on buying your 10 to 14-year-old an Android phone or an iPhone, the dumb HMD Barbie Phone is a fantastic choice. It maintains the right balance of connectivity, modernization, and limitation necessary for a younger child without taking the fun out of owning a phone.</p>

While I initially liked Wear OS smartwatches, Google's ham-fisted strategy means the platform still doesn't get the attention it deserved, and it suffers as a result.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this isn't a problem with Apple; the brand has a consistent vision around its hardware ecosystem, and it did a good job building on that over the course of the last decade. And although there hasn't been much variance with the Apple Watch in the last two years, that's changed with the Series 10. <br><br>The Apple Watch Series 10 doesn't have groundbreaking features or a brand-new design; instead, it is thinner and lighter, has a slightly bigger panel, and several quality-of-life improvements that make a big difference if you're a long-term user. Best of all, it's now on sale, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smartwatch-Aluminium-Always/dp/B0DGHQ2QH6">coming in at $329</a> — a $100 discount over its retail price. The Series 10 is available in 42mm and 46mm sizes, and with aluminum or titanium cases, and it starts at $329 (a limited-time deal) and goes up to $1,049 based on case variants and accessories. <br><br>The 42mm aluminum model usually starts at $399/£399/€499/₹46,900, with the 46mm variant going up to $429/£429/€479/₹49,900. It's available in Silver, Rose Gold, and Jet Black — the model I'm using. The titanium variant starts at $699/£699/€799/₹79,900 for the 42mm version, and $749/£749/€849/₹84,900 if you choose 46mm, and it is available in Natural, Gold, and Slate colors. <br><br>You're looking at an additional $100 if you want cellular connectivity, and while rubber and textile bands don't have an additional premium, steel bands add $50 to the cost of the smartwatch. The variant I'm testing is ₹59,900 ($709) in India, and it is available at $529 in the U.S.</p>
<h2 id="the-thinnest-apple-watch-yet-2">The thinnest Apple Watch yet</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yhgdCqEHBv8iocajtDXexN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yhgdCqEHBv8iocajtDXexN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Series 10 retains a similar design as its predecessor, the biggest difference is the sizing. It is a millimeter thinner than last year, and is in fact the thinnest Apple smartwatch yet. I immediately noticed the difference after switching over from the Series 9; it is also a smidgen lighter, and these things matter on a device that's meant to be worn 24/7. <br><br>The chassis has rounded corners and is generally sleeker, and you'll see a pronounced difference if you're switching from an older model. The aluminum model is great in its own right; it uses an anodized design and a highly polished coating that makes it shine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ckXhbPtjUfJf3redTKQhrN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckXhbPtjUfJf3redTKQhrN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The jet black variant in particular is very good, and it stands out quite a bit. I was worried about the glossy coat wearing thin, but after six months of regular use, the smartwatch still looks pristine. This has never been an issue in the past either, and the Series 10 has the same reliable durability — even without using a case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8F6PrpoTzV9shWxNAZXQtN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8F6PrpoTzV9shWxNAZXQtN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you need something to match your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, the smartwatch is available in titanium. You'll be shelling out at least $699 to get the titanium chassis model, but it looks stunning. A big part of the allure of the Apple Watch is the extensive customizability; the smartwatch has more band options than any rival, and you can tailor it to your preferences. <br><br>I picked up a few leather and stainless steel bands over the years, but I predominantly used the Textile Sport Loop; it's a good pairing with the Series 10 as it is lighter than all the other bands. The thinner design and rounded edges distinguish the Series 10 a decent amount, and it's a worthy upgrade if you're coming from an older model.</p>
<h2 id="a-bigger-oled-panel-with-better-viewing-angles-2">A bigger OLED panel with better viewing angles</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZvzrHMVCP7P5weKWH6Tp5P" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZvzrHMVCP7P5weKWH6Tp5P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is good to have a thinner and lighter watch, but the biggest differentiator with the Series 10 is the panel; it now comes with a 1.96-inch OLED on the 46mm version, and the slightly bigger size means you can see more text. What I like the best is that the viewing angles are better this generation, so you can easily make out the contents on the screen even at an angle — this makes all the difference in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cB8zWqGVwx4PSrCGuDio8P" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cB8zWqGVwx4PSrCGuDio8P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel also gets brighter when outdoors, and again, the difference is noticeable against the Series 9. The bigger panel along with thinner bezels makes the Series 10 look that much more elegant, and I like the additional real estate; in regular use, that translates to an additional line of text when viewing notifications.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sZsKS4apUPVepVgnXvJznN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sZsKS4apUPVepVgnXvJznN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another cool feature is that it uses LTPO tech, so the smartwatch cycles down to 1Hz refresh, allowing a seconds hand. The new Flux watch face does a great job demonstrating this, and that's the one I used most of the time. While the rest of the changes on the smartwatch are iterative, the design combined with the bigger panel make a decent difference in usability, so if you're on an older model and mulling a switch, the Series 10 is the way to go.</p>
<h2 id="an-exhaustive-feature-set-2">An exhaustive feature-set</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YQkYF4McQK7r8nyUbrCGqN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YQkYF4McQK7r8nyUbrCGqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The one new feature I like a lot is that you can play music locally on the watch; there's a tiny speaker located on the left. This is something I've been waiting for quite a while, so it's good to see the Series 10 get the feature. <br><br>It does real-time translations as well, and you can download language packs onto the smartwatch and use the built-in translation utility when your phone isn't around. I don't take many calls on the watch, but it has improved noise isolation, so background noise isn't as audible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fMN3H8jBZ2phCEXWxyMuuN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMN3H8jBZ2phCEXWxyMuuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The on-device features are facilitated by the S10 SiP, which has better energy efficiency and is designed to deliver AI tasks. Apple always does a good job with health and activity monitoring, and the Series 10 continues that heritage. It has the same slate of sensors as the Series 9, and picks up the water depth gauge and water temperature sensor this time. It does a terrific job monitoring health and activity data throughout the day, and I didn't see any issues in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ucAxktH3cy5zFMBRhq39zN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ucAxktH3cy5zFMBRhq39zN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the changes to the workout modes in watchOS 11; you get more detailed insights, and training load is a good way to measure if you're straining your body. The interface itself hasn't changed much, and I still like the double tap gesture quite a bit; I'm waiting to see how third-party apps utilize it now that it's available to everyone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JX9Tq5zeFR9GDdrsrRLStN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JX9Tq5zeFR9GDdrsrRLStN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only thing that's underwhelming about the Series 10 is the battery life; I thought it would finally manage to last two days, but that hasn't been the case. I got a day and a half on average, and while I was able to extend that to two days by disabling always-on mode, but it runs counter to the idea of having a smartwatch, so I didn't bother doing that most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="the-series-10-is-still-my-go-to-recommendation-2">The Series 10 is still my go-to recommendation </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="M3NverptBiF7Qq7uAqhnBP" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M3NverptBiF7Qq7uAqhnBP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As much as I like the thinner design and bigger panel, I wouldn't suggest switching to the Series 10 if you're using its predecessor. But if you're on the Series 7 or older, there are enough upgrades to easily warrant a move. The tweaks to the design make it that much more comfortable to wear, and the OLED panel is bigger, brighter, and has rounded edges. <br><br>The fundamentals are still the same, and I like the consistency — this is something Google needs to address on its own devices. More than anything else, it's for this reason I continue to use the smartwatch. The only annoyance is how regularly I need to charge it; that's why I enjoyed using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-nova-best-hybrid-smartwatch">Withings' ScanWatch Nova</a> over the last month; the hybrid smartwatch only needs to be charged bi-weekly, but it doesn't quite have the same smarts. If you need a full-fledged smartwatch with all the extras, the Series 10 continues to be my go-to choice.</p>

<ul><li>Light's latest minimalist smartphone, the Light Phone 3, is now available for pre-order.</li><li>Light Phone 3 retails for $799, but is available at a $200 discount during the pre-order phase.</li><li>The minimalist phone features an AMOLED monochrome screen, USB-C, and two cameras.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you're looking for a new minimalist smartphone with only the basics, you're in luck: Light is now accepting pre-orders for the Light Phone 3. It's not quite a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-dumb-phone">"dumb phone,"</a> with a smart features like navigation, fingerprint unlock, and two cameras, but it doesn't offer a browser or social media. That, paired with the monochrome screen, is designed to reduce screen time and encourage intentional use of the phone.</p><p>Although the Light Phone 3 may be small and limited in terms of features, it's not exactly cheap: it will retail for $799. Currently, you can pre-order it at a lower price of $599 for a limited time. Light says that it will continue to sell the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/light-phone-2-ultra-minimalistic-phone-only-does-basics">Light Phone 2</a> even after the Phone 3 is released, which is available at a much more manageable $299.</p><p>The highlights of the Light Phone 3 include a bigger, 3.92-inch AMOLED monochrome display. It's up for debate whether this is an upgrade or downgrade from the Phone 2, which used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/minimal-phone-concept">monochrome e-ink panel</a> instead. It's covered in matte glass that should make the Light Phone 3 easy on the eyes, and simple to view in direct sunlight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vXkrkjxS8ka9oGiwFMdkPU" name="Light-Phone-3-2" alt="The Light Phone III in lifestyle photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vXkrkjxS8ka9oGiwFMdkPU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Light Phone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With a Qualcomm SM4450 chipset inside, the Light Phone 3 isn't a powerhouse — and that isn't a surprise. It's equipped with 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM. There are also nice-to-have features like a fingerprint sensor, NFC, GPS, Bluetooth 5.0, and eSIM support, even if they all aren't functional at launch. For instance, digital wallets aren't supported, but could be in the future.</p><p>While certain features are supported, like on-device music playback (no streaming) and navigation, others are not. Light makes it clear that a browser and social media won't ever be supported, because they would defeat the point of having a minimalist phone.</p><p>"Currently the available tools include an alarm, a timer, a calculator, a calendar, a directory, directions, notes/voice memo, and a simple music or podcast player," the company writes on its website. "We will continue to roll out more utility oriented tools with ongoing software updates, always optionally and never pre-installed."</p>

<p>The battery life of the Light Phone 3 is nearly doubled compared to Phone 2, with a capacity of 1,800 mAh. There's also a basic rear camera for the first time — a 50MP sensor that defaults to 12MP photos. On the front, you get an 8MP sensor.</p><p>The Light Phone 3 appears to be better than the Phone 2 in just about every way, but the company doesn't see the newer model as a direct replacement for its predecessor. That could explain the higher price tag and extra features.</p><p>Light estimates that pre-orders placed now will ship around July 2025. They'll be delivered chronologically, so the sooner you pre-order, the sooner your phone will arrive.</p>

<p>Although Samsung&apos;s A Series never gets as much press attention as the OEM&apos;s flagships, these midrange devices typically make up a huge chunk of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> sold every year, and it isn&apos;t hard to see why when you look at the specs. The new Galaxy A36 5G, for instance, boasts a gorgeous 6.7-inch FHD display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1,200 nits of brightness, while under the hood you&apos;ll enjoy an efficient Octa-core processor and 5,000mAh battery.

<ul><li>YouTube is beginning a notification test that will impact users who've selected to receive "All" alerts from channels.</li><li>The platform states if a user hasn't engaged with that channel "recently," it will no longer push notifications to them to avoid further issues.</li><li>YouTube ran a limited test earlier in February for Premium users, giving them 4x watch speed, while it rolled out more radio station customization options in YouTube Music.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is kickstarting a new test on the platform that focuses on how its notifications interact with users and channel creators.</p><p>The platform updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&msgid=333836208">its experiment changelog</a> recently, stating it's playtesting a revamped "notifications experience" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/new-youtube-push-notification-experiment/">Android Police</a>). YouTube states it's trying to reduce the number of times users "turn off all notifications" from the platform within Settings, instead of changing the specific channel's behavior. Users are reportedly more likely to do this when overwhelmed with notifications. To solve this, YouTube says its test involves users who've selected "All" notifications for any given channel.</p><p>Specifically, the app will not push a notification to you, despite the "All" option selected, if you haven't interacted with that channel "recently."

<p>YouTube offers three types of notification settings for channels: All, Personalized, and None. The latter is self-explanatory; however, "All" notifications lets you know everything uploaded by that channel. This involves regular videos, streams, and Shorts. "Personalized" restricts that slightly. The secondary option will alert you about "some" uploads, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3382248?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#zippy=%2Cchange-notification-settings">but YouTube states</a> it uses your interactions with that channel to determine what it should inform you about.</p><p>Regarding experiments, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-new-experimental-features-4x-speeds-and-jump-ahead">YouTube highlighted one</a> in February that lets Premium users test watching videos at 4x speed. It was a limited test run as the platform only made it available for Premium users until February 26. That same test included more for the Jump Ahead feature, which “enables viewers to get to the content they care about faster.”</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube Music's "Ask Music" picks up extra support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-musics-personalized-radio-stations-are-getting-even-smarter">more personalized radio stations</a>. Users can tweak their custom channels with written or voice prompts. Additionally, the company will offer a few suggested prompts like "just jazz songs" or "only female vocals."</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted testing a new set of text-based options for images captured using Circle to Search.</li><li>These choices will appear in the provided AI Overview and will let users summarize or extract text found within the photo, as well as an "explain" option.</li><li>Google highlighted AI Overviews for Circle to Search earlier in 2025 when the Galaxy S25 debuted.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google might have a few upgrades for Circle to Search and how it delivers results for users.</p><p>In an APK dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-new-text-chips-ai-overviews-3539092/">Android Authority</a>, the publication reportedly discovered a trio of new options for Circle to Search during a query. What was discovered — three new "chips" — supposedly concern any AI Overviews that appear when capturing "lengthy text" in Circle to Search. In the provided demo, the company highlighted the three new options: Explain text from image, Summarize, and Extract.</p><p>To "explain," the overview highlights it as a news article, as well as its title and who the post was written by. The AI-generated blurb also links to the website the snapshot is from but not the article itself.</p><p>What's more, the overview gets a little detailed about the images, too, explaining what all is present as best as it can.</p><p>The summarization feature for captured Circle to Search snapshots seemingly took in more than was actually captured. In the demo, the publication only highlighted one specific title; however, the summarization feature knew more and briefly mentioned several more posts on the page. It's more likely this feature will function similarly to how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-tl-dr-summaries-in-drive-update">Gemini's summarization</a> function works in other places.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="5b8Jb95ax8XHhrYaMnb2mU" name="google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-text-chips" alt="Google is reportedly working to bring three text-based actions in AI Overviews when using Circle to Search, dubbed summarize, explain, and extract." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5b8Jb95ax8XHhrYaMnb2mU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The "extraction" chip merges its base function with a smaller summary. In short, the AI Overview will attempt to extract several text-based elements from the Circle to Search photo in a semi-organized way. Since the publication took a photo from a website, the overview broke things down into "Top Section," "News Section," and "Bottom Section (Phone Screen)" categories.</p><p>Right now, the new chips were spotted in the Google app's beta v16.11.36. The post speculates these chips could arrive when scanning items with Google Lens, but nothing's confirmed as the company pushes through development.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Overviews in Circle to Search</a> captured imagery were announced earlier this year with the Galaxy S25 series. The AI-based blurbs will explain what the image is with a few key bullet points and citations for fact-checking (per usual). However, users retain the ability to add a written query alongside the image after the overview appears.</p><p>Also, it seems what's been discovered in the latest Google app beta is yet another expansion of the company's "one-tap actions." Originally, these quicker functions involved identifying/calling phone numbers, email addresses, and URLs. Google said during January's update that if its overview detects one of these aspects, users will see a chip they can tap to quickly visit a website or contact its personnel.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Qualcomm is nearing a big decision. It's reportedly gearing up to release a new, midrange Snapdragon chip. While this "budget" SoC is rumored to be powered by Arm cores — not the custom Oryon cores powering other Elite chips — it's unclear whether the company will still use "Elite" branding. We've seen reports use both Snapdragon 8s Elite and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-might-ditch-the-elite-tag-and-go-with-snapdragon-8s-gen-4-for-its-next-chip">Snapdragon 8s Gen 4</a> to refer to the unannounced mobile chip.</p><p>The problem? The custom Oryon CPU cores are what make Snapdragon 8 Elite chips, well, "elite." Let's review how we got here.</p>
<h2 id="the-switch-from-arm-to-oryon-2">The switch from Arm to Oryon</h2>
<p>Last year, Qualcomm finally achieved its breakthrough moment. It launched the Snapdragon X lineup of laptop and desktop-class systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) in June 2024 that would eventually disrupt the stronghold competitors AMD and Intel had on personal computing. Then, Qualcomm used what it learned to develop the Snapdragon X platform and brought it to mobile with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>.</p><p>By now, I've had the chance to review and test multiple Snapdragon X and Snapdragon 8 Elite laptops and phones, respectively. They're both as good as advertised. Snapdragon X brought excellent power efficiency and responsiveness to Windows laptops, and Snapdragon 8 Elite brought massive year-over-year performance improvements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC" name="oneplus-13-blue-snapdragon-8-elite-01" alt="A blue OnePlus 13 with a Snapdragon 8 Elite placard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oryon cores are the secret to Qualcomm's major success. The company used its own custom Oryon cores instead of off-the-shelf designs from Arm to make the Snapdragon X, Snapdragon X Plus, and Snapdragon X Elite SoCs. Essentially, it followed the same blueprint Apple used when designing its own silicon.</p><p>A quick look at Qualcomm's PC processors reveals that chips with Oryon cores don't always use the Elite brand. That's reserved for Qualcomm's best PC chips, while budget versions with slower clock speeds and/or fewer cores use names like Snapdragon X and Snapdragon X Plus.</p><p>But we've never seen a Qualcomm chip branded with the Elite tag that doesn't use custom Oryon cores. Although there are conflicting reports about whether the next Snapdragon 8s mobile processor will get a "Gen 4" or "Elite" brand name, the right option seems clear.</p><p>Qualcomm should name the unreleased midrange chip Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 to avoid consumer confusion and keep the Elite brand sacred for the company's standout processors — those with Oryon cores.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-qualcomm-s-next-midrange-chip-be-called-2">What will Qualcomm's next midrange chip be called?</h2>
<p>Right now, there's no official word on what Qualcomm will call the next Snapdragon 8s chip. One rumor from reputable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1902269621266255889" target="_blank">Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter)</a> earlier this month said that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm/the-first-snapdragon-8s-elite-phones-could-launch-next-month-leaker-claims">the SoC was "set to launch soon</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm/the-first-snapdragon-8s-elite-phones-could-launch-next-month-leaker-claims">"</a> referring to it as Snapdragon 8s Elite. More recently, a tip from Digital Chat Station this week on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pk8WP9umB" target="_blank">Weibo</a> called the unreleased chip the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4.</p><p>Although both rumored names are only speculation at this point, one seems more fitting than the other.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="46UHHatjXep5JgAVYnLqx7" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-01" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite placard at a press event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/46UHHatjXep5JgAVYnLqx7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's because current leaks claim to reveal the upcoming Snapdragon 8s chip's core structure, and custom Oryon cores are absent. According to Digital Chat Station, this processor has a model number of SN8735. It is said to be headlined by a 3.21GHz Cortex-X4 Prime Core, plus three more 3.01GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores. The SoC is also expected to include two 2.02GHz Cortex-A720 efficiency cores.</p><p>If this configuration turns out to be accurate, the Snapdragon 8s chip will use standard Arm designs rather than Qualcomm's best Oryon cores. This isn't a bad thing, because the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is expensive, and the "s" variant is supposed to be cheaper. However, it does mean that the Elite branding wouldn't exactly make sense for this particular SoC.</p>
<h2 id="qualcomm-is-rumored-to-make-the-right-move-2">Qualcomm is rumored to make the right move</h2>
<p>Qualcomm is a very large company operating in many different verticals, from cellular modems to smartphone and desktop chips. Under those circumstances, it's easy for naming schemes to get convoluted. Just look at what Intel and Sony have done over the years, releasing products like the Intel Core i9 14900K or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH-1000XM5</a>.</p><p>Luckily, Qualcomm seems to be aware of how important branding is for consumer clarity. At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC Barcelona 2025</a>, it introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-dragonwing-for-enterprise-products-announced">a new naming scheme</a> for its vast portfolio of products. Qualcomm will be used for general products, like modems, with the Snapdragon brand serving consumer products and the Dragonwing brand covering the enterprise market.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SPZiqduU9qWPUXB9Jcd65n" name="Snapdragon-logo-water" alt="The Snapdragon logo sitting above water in a pool next to the ocean in Maui" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPZiqduU9qWPUXB9Jcd65n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm may be set up for an interesting decision. On the one hand, using the name Snapdragon 8s Elite would make it clear that the to-be-released chip is part of the same generation as the Snapdragon 8 Elite. On the other hand, using the name Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 would make it clear that the chip isn't using custom Oryon cores.</p><p>Only time will tell which name Qualcomm will end up using. Personally, I'm voting for the next Snapdragon 8s SoC to be called the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. While the Elite nomenclature is an excellent brand, it's too good to be diluted. Currently, every Elite chip features Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores, and I think it should stay that way.</p>

<hr>
<p>It seems Samsung's 2024 flagship phones are in for one more software beta before the big day arrives.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1904789984533766231">Tarun Vats on X</a> states Samsung is reportedly starting to roll out One UI 7 Beta 6 to enrolled Galaxy S24 devices in its Beta Program (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-one-ui-7-beta-6-released/">SamMobile</a>). The patch was brought to the tipster's attention on social media via another user, who claims it's been spotted in India. The latest beta version rocks firmware version ZYCE; however, the publiction states it's also been appearing for phones "globally" in the program.</p><p>Interestingly, the changelog is a little familiar. According to Vats' snapshot, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24 series</a> is picking up new One UI 7 features like a "press and hold" function to launch its digital assistant.</p><p>There are also several AI-based features arriving on the most recent past-gen series:</p>
<ul><li>Call recording summary converted to text</li><li>Create your own stickers and images</li><li>Summarize webpages</li><li>Edit video sounds</li><li>Natural language-based search in Settings</li></ul>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy S24 receives the One UI 7 beta 6 update in India.Build version: S928BXXU4ZYCE/S928BOXM4ZYCE/S928BXXU4BYCERepost pic.twitter.com/0F8SEykG02<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1904789984533766231">March 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Samsung is fixing a few bugs on the S24 series regarding its battery animations and UI errors in its media controller.</p><p>If these "new features" hitting the S24 series seem familiar, it's because Samsung recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-3-rolling-out">brought the same set</a> to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6's beta. That patch for the foldables was roughly 1.2GB in size. There's a chance users with the S24 series could see a similar size, considering the update's strong similarities. Moreover, the changelog's mention of "editing video sounds" and sticker/image creation points us to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a> AI features.</p><p>The latter was mentioned during Samsung's teasers earlier this year, where the company said it wanted the feature to be more "multimodal." Users will have the choice of using an S Pen, written descriptions, or their voice with the AI to generate an image.</p><p>As previously stated, there's speculation that this could be the final beta the Galaxy S24 sees before Samsung's official debut of One UI 7. With six betas under our belt, the company is preparing to rollout the new sofware upgrade <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">on April 10 in the U.S.</a>, three days after it goes global. Something to keep in mind is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-schedule-galaxy-dates-spotted-overseas">a rollout schedule</a> for the update that appeared on the company's Czech Republic website.</p><p>Users in the region are seemingly receiving the update for the Galaxy S24, Flip 6, and Fold 6 on April 10 — like the U.S., but it's unclear if the remainder of the schedule is what we should expect. It states the Galaxy S24 FE, S23 series, Flip 5, and Fold 5 should receive it "a week later" alongside more important dates for other devices.</p>

<ul><li>Fitbit is refreshing the Health Metrics page on mobile to feature a new look that matches the rest of the app.</li><li>The Health Metrics UI is also changing, ditching the "Today" and "Trends" views.</li><li>There's now a focus on the individual health metrics, and you can find more detailed data by tapping a specific metric.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit">Fitbit app</a> on Android and iOS has a Health Metrics page for data points like breathing rate, resting heart rate, blood oxygen, heart rate variability, and skin temperature variation. While the Health Metrics page used to be a basic user-interface that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-design-fitbit-app-redesign">didn't match the bulk of the Fitbit app</a>, that's changing in an update. Aside from getting a new look, the Health Metrics UI is tweaked to make it easier to view your data, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/27/fitbit-health-metrics-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>While the preview card on the main Fitbit app homepage isn't new, tapping it brings you to a fresh Health Metrics page. Here, you'll see a list of the five health metrics recorded, and a quick gauge of how many of those metrics are in your "personal range." In a new change, only the "Today" stats are shown on the main Health Metrics page.</p><p>To see longer-term data, you'll need to tap a specific metric individually. This will bring up a detailed view with graphs and data spanning the past week, month, and year intervals. This page also explains each data point and its significance, with a <strong>Learn more</strong> tab for users to get more information.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1854px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.28%;"><img id="UiPkkxcZur78WtH7Ba3DAV" name="Fitbit-Health-Metrics-UI-New" alt="The new look for Health Metrics on the Fitbit app for iOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UiPkkxcZur78WtH7Ba3DAV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1854" height="1340" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Previously, you could see this data by switching to the "Trends" tab in Health Metrics. Instead of the "Today" and "Trends" tab structure, there's now a new focus on sorting data and views by the metrics themselves.</p><p>The update is rolling out as part of version 4.39 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbit-health-fitness/id462638897" target="_blank">Fitbit app for iOS</a>, which was released last week. The latest version of the Fitbit app hit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitbit.FitbitMobile" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> on Monday, March 24, but not everyone is seeing the latest Health Metrics changes yet.</p>

As my wife and I celebrate 21 years together this year (half of that with kids), we've run into our fair share of struggles thinking up something creative to do at home for those special nights.</p>

<p>Recently, though, we've been using a Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S to play VR games together, and they've made some of the most memorable date nights in recent years. We've played minigolf on the peak of Mount Olympus. Had tea among the spires at Shangri-La. Stood together under a massive Christmas tree and admired a little village. We even painted together while watching a Bob Ross video, all without making a huge mess.</p><p>It was an experiment I tried at the end of 2024 when I gave my wife a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S </a>and a copy of Walkabout Mini Golf for Christmas. My wife loved playing Beat Saber back in the day, but we haven't had regular VR gaming sessions as a couple in a few years. Thankfully, she loved it, and we've been playing at least weekly since the experiment began.</p><p>It's a great alternative to watching TV or reading books — although those are great when we just want to relax after a busy day — but there's something amazing about being able to go somewhere with your significant other after a busy day without having to hire a babysitter for the kids.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="THmxeH7d8PzpSrFE7jEfhL" name="walkabout-mini-golf-screenshot-paris-01" alt="A screenshot of the Eiffel Tower course in Walkabout Mini Golf on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THmxeH7d8PzpSrFE7jEfhL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Spending an evening on top of the Eiffel Tower isn't something you normally get the chance to do on a regular basis. Some people may never visit the iconic landmark in their lives, but we've been twice now and haven't been late to bed thanks to Walkabout Mini Golf, one of the best Meta Quest games you can find.</p><p>This truly is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/walkabout-minigolf-meta-quest-mars-gardens">one of the most creative games I've ever played</a>. It's ironic that a mini golf game is a good reason to buy a Meta Quest headset, but I promise it's the system seller you never knew you needed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/walkabout-mini-golf/2462678267173943/">base game is $14.99</a> and comes with eight 18-hole courses, each of which features a gorgeous setting with unique music and entrancing vibes.</p>

<p>My wife was instantly drawn to the Cherry Blossom course, which features a normal difficulty daytime course and a gorgeous nighttime hard course, complete with glowing lanterns, illuminated Zen gardens, and an intriguing "fox hunt" to complete to get a special putter.</p><p>Fox hunts involve finding objects hidden throughout each course and then following clues to help you find the next. Each hard course has a unique putter, including all the DLC courses available, meaning you can find over 20 putters that can be used at any time in the future. These are excellent date night activities and genuinely a ton of fun!</p>

<p>The pace and beauty of Walkabout Mini Golf are beyond perfect for date night at home. You can take your time hitting each putt, stand together and admire the sights, or go on a hunt for all 18 golf balls on each of the game's normal difficulty courses. My wife and I even sat and had tea as we overlooked the cliffs of Shangri-La, one of over 20 DLC courses that cost $3 to $4 apiece, and each contains 36 holes of mini golfing.</p><p>Some courses now have a separate slingshot course, which adds a whole new dimension and set of challenges. Plus, fun modifiers like mini mode give you a new perspective on each course, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz8pZEHKQsk">leafblower mode</a> can even be used to make your own versions of minigolf if you so choose.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LMVv2WRBvgCVTZNvXsodcL" name="walkabout-mini-golf-screenshot-shangri-la-01" alt="A screenshot of the Shangri-La course in Walkabout Mini Golf on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LMVv2WRBvgCVTZNvXsodcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Getting set up in the game is easy since all you'll need to do is make a room name and have the other person join. No need for complicated friend list systems or making accounts, and anyone can play any course <em>you</em> own without having to buy it for themselves so long as they tag along with you. The only restriction is that they won't be able to hunt for the special golf balls or collect the special putter unless they own it.</p><p>New courses come out roughly every 6-8 weeks, ensuring that you have just enough time to master one before the next one comes out. There are over 20 courses, each with 36 holes of golfing, so it'll take quite a long time to see and do everything.</p><p>And since they're only around $4 each, you can get away with grabbing a fancy drink from the store and spending $8 for each of you to have the course, making it a very inexpensive date, indeed!</p>

<p>As Valentine's Day approached, I started looking for something unique to do for this year's celebration. I had used the painting app Vermillion on the Meta Quest before but hadn't used its multiplayer mode before. After chatting with a few folks about how it works, I dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/vermillion-vr-painting/4900967296622279/">$20 on a second copy</a> so my wife could paint with me and planned an entire evening out of it.</p><p>I set up two dining room chairs in the living room, roughly 8 feet apart, giving each of us plenty of room to place our easel stand, brush stand, and palette table on the floor. Of course, these objects are all virtual and take up no physical space, but they felt like they were physically there because of Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S's color mixed reality vision.</p><p>Vermillion is one of the many Meta Quest games that supports mixed reality and co-located spaces, meaning my wife and I could see each other virtually painting as we sat in the same room.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qdsi4vTbqyfyDaj65GzVxY" name="vermillion-screenshot-meta-quest-3" alt="Painting in mixed reality in Vermillion on the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qdsi4vTbqyfyDaj65GzVxY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>If you (or your partner) have ever wanted to paint to Bob Ross but were afraid of the equipment investment or making a mess, Vermillion is a brilliant place to start.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The game has a browser built-in with preset bookmarks for Bob Ross videos, as well as several other famous TV artists who teach you how to paint anything from landscapes to portraits, flowers, pets, or just about anything else you want.</p><p>Vermillion is an oil painting simulator but features several modern digital niceties that Adobe users will immediately feel comfortable with. The game sports 10 brush types, plus a palette knife so you can get started on mountainscapes just like Bob Ross.</p><p>Those digital niceties I spoke of include an eyedropper tool so you can easily replicate any color in the canvas, layers that allow you to separately paint layers on top of your digital canvas — so the virtual oil doesn't mix — plus "easy mode" features like undo and redo buttons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uaZsjNmR5RLzWwpHS4KuZU" name="vermillion-screenshot-palette-meta-quest-3" alt="The paint palette with oils in Vermillion on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uaZsjNmR5RLzWwpHS4KuZU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mixing the oils on the paint palette feels surprisingly natural. Colors can be spread anywhere you want on your palette, and the default colors are similar to what you'll find in most Bob Ross videos, although alternatives are available. There's even a handy "clear palette" button that'll let you totally start over from scratch when you're ready to move on to the next set of colors.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Oil painting in Vermillion is incredibly authentic, yet easy, thanks to some modern tools like layers and an undo button.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If you make a mistake while painting or need to start over, just grab the rag, dip it in some paint thinner, and wipe away the accident. Of course, if you're a real Bob Ross fan, accidents don't need to be erased. They're happy little accidents and can be turned into something joyful and fun, which is the entire point of painting like this, anyway.</p><p>Once you've finished up and are ready to show off your creation, it's as easy as opening up the menu and hitting the export button. You'll get a selection of choices that include saving the painting as its own file or displaying it in a virtual gallery frame inside the saved image.</p><p>And don't worry if painting seems a little overwhelming at first. There's an entire paint-by-numbers section in the menu that makes it easy to learn the ropes and make something beautiful without feeling like you need to make something perfect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:37.50%;"><img id="5Mmg3dFNRzewfzKM3YXM7k" name="vermillion-screenshot-paintings-meta-quest-3" alt="Paintings of mountains made in Vermillion on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Mmg3dFNRzewfzKM3YXM7k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="768" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both of us were impressed with the quality of the images the game exports, although it seems that the PC version offers more export options so you can get your painting printed on larger canvases after digitally painting them. The game also lets you export it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamVR/comments/pfuyfk/export_beautifully_varnished_3d_models_of_your/">as a 3D model</a> so you can import it into metaverse-like apps like VR Chat or Resonite, or even use the 3D models in different creative ways.</p><p>The developer regularly posts to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/vermillionvr">the game's Facebook group</a>, and users post their latest paintings all the time. It's a great place to get inspiration or to just find the next video you want to follow along.</p>
<h2 id="give-virtual-dates-a-try-2">Give virtual dates a try</h2>
<p>I hope these two at-home date ideas helped inspire you to try it for yourself. My wife finds her Meta Quest 3S very comfortable during these sessions because I've got it equipped with an aftermarket head strap and face pad from our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> list.</p><p>I'd also recommend picking up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Virtual-Baseball-Controller-Attachment-Simulator/dp/B0D9Y665YV/">Yoges Meta Quest 3 golf club</a> attachment to give your controller the real feel of a club while mini-golfing. It makes a crazy difference and makes the date feel even more authentic!</p>

Amazon's Big Spring Sale discounts many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a>, but some of the best deals have already sold out — aside from iffy third-party sellers on Amazon. As someone who's reviewed a dozen+ Garmin watches in the last couple of years, I'll point you to my favorites at every price point so you can grab one quickly!</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><em><strong>Amazon's Big Spring Sale is LIVE: see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>My first recommendation for new Garmin users is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413"><strong>Garmin Vivoactive 5 for $217 ($83 off)</strong></a> because it offers a great all-around introduction to the core Garmin features like enhanced Body Battery, sleep coaching, Garmin Coach, workout guidance with animated reps, post-workout benefit with recovery time suggestions, and dozens of sports modes.</p><p>But for more serious Garmin power users, most of your favorite current- and last-gen models are anywhere from $50 to $250 off. As much as I loved the $1,100 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>, its upsides are harder to sell when you can buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-adventure-smartwatch-touchscreen-wellness/dp/B09NMKW4YJ"><strong>Garmin Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar for $250 off ($649)</strong></a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-epix-pro-gen-2-standard-edition-47mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-slate-gray-with-black-band/6545143.p?skuId=6545143"><strong>Garmin Epix Pro Gen 2 for $250 off ($649)</strong></a>.

You get a ton of customizable EQ options through the companion Beats app, plus three pre-installed sound profiles — Beats Signature, Entertainment, and Conversation. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2592px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bkTobtLC23H9BbiATv9Pmj" name="beats-studio-pro-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Beats Studio Pro lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bkTobtLC23H9BbiATv9Pmj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2592" height="1458" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Beats by Dre)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beats Signature is meant to provide the classic listening experience for audiophiles, utilizing the Studio Pro&apos;s 40mm drivers and dynamic head tracking to deliver super-immersive sound, regardless of genre. The Entertainment profile, on the other hand, automatically adjusts to optimize the sound of movies, TV shows, and games, while the Conversation preset is meant for phone calls and meetings.</p><p>Now, I&apos;ll be real with you: given the age of the Beats Studio Pro (the headphones dropped in 2023), I wouldn&apos;t pay full price at this point. You could easily take that $350 and buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony XM5</a> instead for a considerably better experience all around. But pair these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">noise-cancelling headphones</a> with nearly 50% off AND three free months of Apple Music? That&apos;s pretty much a no-brainer recommendation from me.</p>

If you want an excellent charger or power bank for your mobile tech, be it an Android or iOS device, Windows laptop, or Chromebook even, Anker has the perfect charging gadget for you. The only complaint I've ever had with Anker's charging accessories is their price. The good news is that frequent discounts like the ongoing Amazon Big Spring Sale hack and slash the price of Anker products by delightful amounts.</p><p>One of the best new power banks by the brand is the Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 165W, Built-In and Retractable Cables). Shockingly, this 25,000mAh portable power bank is already on sale, going for a sizeable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Multi-Device-Charging-Retractable/dp/B0DCBB2YTR"><strong>20% off on Amazon</strong></a> right now.

<p>Some of the highlights of the Anker Laptop Power Bank include its dual retractable USB Type-C cables. These are the same flat InstaCords that we saw on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-car-charger-retractable-cable">Retractable Car Charger</a>, but one is more durable than the other as it's made of a flat nylon braided material. The tougher retractable cord also acts as a lanyard, which I think is proof of Anker's confidence in the cable's durability. You also get two other ports to plug in your own wires, one of which is USB-C and the other is USB-A.</p><p>Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-prime-lineup-fixes-common-power-bank-problems">Anker Prime series</a>, the Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 165W, Built-In and Retractable Cables) also has an LED screen on the front. This displays important details such as the temperature of the portable power bank, the power output/input, and the battery percentage left.</p>

<p>Since this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-high-capacity-power-banks">excellent high capacity power bank</a> has a total power rating of 165W, you can easily charge several devices at max charging speeds all at once. All three USB-C ports output 100W, so you can fast charge your laptop, Chromebook, or super fast charging phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>At 20% off, this power bank is a lot more affordable, knocking $22 off the usual going price. Since this is a trustworthy brand, you get peace of mind. But if that isn't enough for you, the 18-month warranty should lay all your other fears to rest.</p>

<hr>
<p>Get ready for the weekend with a few updates for Google's AI and apps that will prepare you for a summer full of traveling.</p><p>In a press release, the company detailed the start of these updates for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">its AI Overviews in Search</a>. Google says "starting this week," users can begin receiving "trip ideas" for cities, as well as "distinct" regions and entire countries. To get started, Google gives the following example: "create an itinerary for Costa Rica with a focus on nature."</p><p>The company's AI software in Search will return a map for users to browse. Additionally, you'll find photos and reviews from others who've visited the area and engaged in activities similar to what you're interested in. The AI Overview will also break down what activities it thinks you could partake in throughout your stay in a given region/country.</p><p>This feature will soon rollout for English-based user queries in the U.S. on mobile and desktop. What's more, Google says users can export their AI-generated itinerary to share with others — which could be helpful if you're traveling with people.</p><p>Alternatively, Google says you could even leverage Gemini for some travel plan assistance. Users can ask the AI model for cheap hotels or "affordable activities" to do in a given country and see what it returns. Moreover, it highlights the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gems-tips/">utilize its Gems feature</a>, which lets users tailor Gemini to their specific needs.</p>

<p>With a place in mind, the company says users will soon find the ability to "track prices" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="google.com/hotels">for hotels</a> after finding a plane through Google Flights. A new option to track prices for your chosen destination and planned stay will soon appear. Google recommends users tap the "price-tracking toggle" within the search filters in Hotels to receive email notifications if/when things change.</p><p>Hotel price tracking is said to begin rolling out "globally this week" on mobile and desktop.</p><p>Once you've arrived, Google Maps might be your best friend in that wonderous new place if you've been doing a bit of research. The post highlights a new Maps feature called "screenshot." If enabled, Maps will leverage its Gemini capabilities to scour through your saved screenshots so you can review and save any useful ones into a comprehensive list. That list of places can then be shared with others with whom you may be traveling.</p><p>This new Gemini-backed screenshot feature in Maps is rolling out "this week" in the U.S. for iOS users first. Google says Android support is "coming soon."</p><p>Lastly, the company highlights Google Lens' usefulness when out in the world.

<p>Elsewhere, Google is trying to help folks decide where they might travel this year with a glimpse into some trending destinations in 2025. When looking internationally, many trends in Google Flights lean toward the Island of Curacao, Osaka (Japan), St. Lucia (Caribbean Island), Tokyo, and more. However, domestically, folks are interested in going to San Juan, Puerto Rico the most, followed by Billings, Montana.</p><p>Hopping into Google Search shows people are looking for information on "island vacation outfits" and "wide leg linen pants."</p><p>While that Billings, Montana result might be a shock after Puerto Rico, Google says it could be because users are interested in "easy access" to the outdoors. Montana is trending alongside Juneau, Alaska, and Bangor, Maine. What's more, users are searching for "cabins" as part of a romantic getaway this year, too.</p><p>As a side note, Google's analytics show people are looking for ways to get the most space out of their bags while traveling. "Vacuum bags" and "compression packing cubes" have topped the charts recently.</p>

<ul><li>Garmin Connect Plus, a new premium plan with "personalized Active Intelligence insights," launches Thursday.</li><li>The AI assistant will summarize the meaning of your recent workout or sleep data.</li><li>Connect Plus also includes a new performance dashboard with customizable activity graphs, live workouts in the Connect mobile app, more coaching videos, expanded LiveTrack features, and exclusive badges.</li><li>The service costs $6.99/month or $69.99/year after a 30-day free trial.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Garmin has announced a new Connect Plus subscription headlined by Active Intelligence, which provides "personalized insights and suggestions throughout the day based on health and activity data." And while this news will be polarizing to long-time Garmin users, the company promises that nothing your watch does now will end up behind a paywall.</p><p>"The Garmin Connect app is a free, personalized experience, and that's not going away," a Garmin rep told us, but Connect Plus will provide "premium features" for those willing to spend $6.99/month or $69.99/year.</p><p>Garmin's screenshots show how Active Intelligence will use data like your most recent activity, last night's sleep, and scheduled workout to provide an LLM-made summary at the top of the Home view.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dayKKxVDbTqXNNUmuBwPeL" name="garmin-active-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Samsung Garmin Connect Plus screenshots showing the Active Intelligence AI summarizing users' data to recommend future activities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dayKKxVDbTqXNNUmuBwPeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Active Intelligence, not to be confused with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Strava's Athlete Intelligence</a>, is launching in beta. Garmin told me they "don't have a set timeline" for when it'll leave beta; they'll instead focus on "monitoring user feedback and performance" to see how well their AI performs in practice.</p><p>The Garmin Connect Plus AI beta seems like a more beginner-friendly, text-heavy version of training status and readiness underpinned by Firstbeat Analytics, explaining concepts newer users may not understand. But for long-time Garmin fans familiar with the jargon, Garmin is sweetening the pot with other perks.</p><p>Anyone following a Garmin Run Coach or Cycling Coach will now get access to "additional exclusive expert guidance from Garmin coaches" like "educational content and videos." So you're paying for more advice from <em>real</em> people, not just an AI.</p><p>If you regularly use LiveTrack for family members to see your progress on the trail, Connect Plus will let you make a personalized profile page with a custom URL where current and past sessions are visible, with a way to embed the LiveTrack on a website. Family and friends will also receive an automatic text when you start an activity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a23nARUPE6sajskkCUTSfL" name="garmin-connect-plus-performance-dashboard" alt="Two Garmin Connect Plus performance dashboards focused on cycling and running insights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a23nARUPE6sajskkCUTSfL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Garmin Connect already has ways to check your workout progress over time, Connect Plus has a revamped Performance Dashboard (see above) that lets you create "customizable graphs and charts over different periods of time to get a more comprehensive view of training progress" in terms of health and fitness trends.</p><p>If you like using your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> for indoor workouts, Garmin Connect Plus will let you see your watch's real-time heart rate and other data in the mobile Connect app. You'll be able to see animated previews of exercise reps for over 500 of the 1,600+ exercises that Garmin tracks on a larger screen than your watch, as well as use "workout videos" for guidance.</p><p>Finally, if you're really invested in the social side of Garmin Connect, then subscribing to Connect Plus will let you add a colorful frame to your Conect app profile pic and strive to finish exclusive challenges for extra points and badges.</p>

<p>Garmin has promised to give me access to Connect Plus starting today; I will write a follow-up on my hands-on impressions soon.</p><p>I'm not surprised by this development. Just last week, while writing about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-975-and-275-will-show-if-garmin-is-running-out-of-ideas">possible Garmin Forerunner 975 and 275 features</a>, I predicted that Garmin would emulate rival brands and offer a paid "chatbot that inputs your fitness data and explains features for beginner runners." I swear that Garmin hadn't told me about Active Intelligence when I wrote that!</p><p>As I write <em>this</em> before the announcement, I'd predict that plenty of Garmin fans will feel some type of way about Connect Plus.</p><p>Garmin likes its subscriptions — see Outdoor Plus, InReach satellite messaging and SOSs, golf or boating premium features, etc. — but a big appeal to <em>most</em> Garmin watches was that you paid a high upfront cost and then got years of use with free analytics and coaching.</p><p>Garmin has stressed that no current features will fall behind a paywall, but it's fair to question how many future features will end up as Connect Plus exclusives to make the subscription more appealing years from now. But that's just conjecture, and Garmin watches aren't suddenly deficient because of this plan.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cZbJQ7pnaQLkWeZWYjCEZX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-daily-suggested-workout" alt="A daily suggested workout for an anerobic run on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZbJQ7pnaQLkWeZWYjCEZX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin didn't have an answer when I asked if they'd give a complementary subscription to new Garmin watch buyers. Anyone who pays $1,000+ for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> can <em>afford</em> a subscription but would probably argue that they should get Connect Plus for free for a set time period — just as new Fitbit buyers get six months of Premium.</p><p>At the very least, a $6.99/month Connect Plus subscription is more affordable than most of the $10+ fitness subs out there, like Apple Fitness Plus, Fitbit Premium, or Strava Premium. But the AI novelty aside, I think Garmin's value will depend more on what kind of coaching content and workout videos it offers.</p><p>Basically, I'll need to be convinced that Connect Plus is something I need in my life, but as long as Garmin is being accurate that no current features will subtly sneak into the Connect Plus umbrella, then I'm not bothered by Garmin trying to make more money. The watches still work the same way they did yesterday.</p><p>That's why, even though some people's kneejerk reaction to Connect Plus might be outrage, I'm cautiously optimistic that Garmin's AI will make the brand's data-heavy app more accessible to casual users and curious to see whether the value lives up to the price for power users.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>POCO managed to carve out a niche in the budget and mid-range categories by delivering value-focused phones, and devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review">X7 Pro</a> exemplify this trait. If anything, POCO is doing a better job in this area than its Redmi sister brand, and this is clearly evident in the mid-range, where last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-poco-f6-pro-is-the-most-underrated-phone-of-2024">F6 Pro</a> is still a fantastic choice. <br><br>The brand is doing things a little differently in 2025; while it's still launching the F7 Pro, the focus this year is the F7 Ultra — its most powerful phone yet. The F7 Ultra is a definite statement from POCO that it can produce a phone that can hold its own against the best that OPPO, Vivo, Google, and Honor have to offer. <br><br>With the latest Qualcomm silicon, a QHD panel, 5300mAh<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025"> silicon battery</a>, and 120W charging, the F7 Ultra has a solid foundation, but its the cameras where the device truly stands out. POCO admitted in the past that cameras aren't the biggest priority for the brand, and while its phones took decent photos, they didn't measure up to their immediate rivals. <br><br>That's changing with the F7 Ultra; the phone has a 50MP main camera with a Light Fusion 800 imaging module, and it's joined by a 50MP telephoto with 2.5x optical zoom, and 32MP wide-angle lens. The best part is the price, with the phone debuting at $649, undercutting its rivals by a sizeable amount. <br><br>I used the F7 Ultra for just over two weeks, and here's why I think it is the best value-focused flagship you can buy in 2025.</p>

<p>POCO unveiled the F7 Pro and F7 Ultra on March 27, 2025, and both devices will go on sale in select regions in Southeast Asia, the U.K., and other global markets in the coming weeks. The F7 Ultra is sold in yellow and black color variants, and POCO is selling it in two models: the base edition has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and it costs $649. There's also a 16GB/512GB model that costs $699. <br><br>To incentivize the launch, POCO is selling the 12GB/256GB F7 Ultra at $599, and the 16GB/512GB edition at $649. Considering there's just a $50 difference between the two, I'd suggest getting the 512GB model — that's the one I'm using. <br><br>The F7 Pro has the same design, same panel, same 50MP main camera, and a bigger 6000mAh battery. It misses out on the auxiliary cameras and isn't quite as fast, but otherwise, there isn't much in the way of difference between the two devices. The F7 Pro is debuting in black, silver, and blue, and the blue variant is the one to get. <br><br>It's available with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, retailing for $499. The 12GB/512GB edition costs $549, and just like the F7 Ultra, POCO is discounting either model of the F7 Pro by $50 during the launch window.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z37jG4ZfeMznB8exVSVrsb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra next to POCO F7 Pro against blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z37jG4ZfeMznB8exVSVrsb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Xiaomi's phones now have a semblance of design consistency between generations, that hasn't trickled down to POCO's devices. As such, the F7 Ultra has a brand-new design aesthetic that has no resemblance to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a> or F6 Pro. Thankfully, POCO is using the same design on the F7 Pro as well, so at least both models have similarities — which wasn't the case last year on the standard POCO F6.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wEJePx2d6HPHueRBEoTWcb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra side view with power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wEJePx2d6HPHueRBEoTWcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The F7 Ultra has flat sides, but the beveled edges make it comfortable to hold and use the device, and the back curves slightly where it meets the mid-frame. There's a new design for the camera housing at the back, and it doesn't quite stand out as much; it's just a circular design that houses the three imaging modules, with the flash sitting on the right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J23ZHvxUUGscG7hVcB9Znb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra next to F7 Pro back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J23ZHvxUUGscG7hVcB9Znb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a steel ring encircling the camera island, and a yellow accent around the housing that gives it a little flair, but overall, it doesn't have the same bold characteristics that defined POCO's previous phones in this series. Talking about bold, the yellow color definitely stands out, and the matte texture at the back has a great in-hand feel, and doesn't pick up any smudges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LyJorK9DqSwb8axGDhLCdb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra side view highlighting matte texture" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyJorK9DqSwb8axGDhLCdb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the yellow color scheme in general — it makes the device that much more distinctive — and while the back looks great, the sides are rather plain, and I think POCO should have color-matched the sides to deliver a more cohesive design. POCO did that with the F7 Pro, which has a silver back and sides, so I'm not really sure why it didn't on the Ultra variant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aBrPAD22e9UaTLzLHgtqab" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra bottom view highlighting audio and USB-C connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aBrPAD22e9UaTLzLHgtqab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, POCO did the right thing by using matte sides, and it makes holding the phone a little easier. The mid-frame is aluminum, and coming in at 212g, the phone has a nice heft to it. There's good weight distribution as well, and it never once felt unwieldy. The rest of the features are standard; you get a dual-SIM tray, power and volume buttons on the right, and stereo sound.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uVdZ9wsERzwzTvxezuYifb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra back view on blue background with yellow colors next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uVdZ9wsERzwzTvxezuYifb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, POCO is using an ultrasonic module on the F7 Ultra, and it is located at just the right position. The module is fast and doesn't have any issues, and it holds up just as well with wet or oily fingers. Rounding out the design, the F7 Ultra gets IP68 dust and water resistance, and it can be easily submerged in up to 2.5 meters of water — higher than the 1.5-meter restriction that's on most phones. <br><br>The F7 Ultra isn't quite as flamboyant as a few POCO phones I used in the past, but it has a good in-hand feel, and it's clearly built to last, and that's what ultimately matters.</p>

<p>POCO has used 6.67-inch displays for a while now, and that isn't changing with the F7 Ultra; the phone has the same size and 3200 x 1440 resolution. There's Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and the panel is noticeably brighter this time — I didn't see any issues using it outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CP442avfDKZGQr3u4nwppb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra camera underneath the OLED panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CP442avfDKZGQr3u4nwppb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Colors are vibrant out of the box, and POCO knows how to calibrate these panels at the factory. That has always been a plus point on the brand's devices, and that hasn't changed. You get good customizability with the colors as well; the Original colour Pro is set out of the box, and the device has Vivid and Saturated modes alongside color-accurate P3 and Adobe sRGB. Of course, you can also adjust the color balance according to your tastes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="enMviRUfwsPCjKD9Bbagzb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra running a YouTube video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/enMviRUfwsPCjKD9Bbagzb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is set to FHD+ and auto refresh out of the box, so you will need to dive into the settings to change these two to QHD+ and 120Hz to make the most out of the device. A new feature that's debuting this time is circular polarization technology, which delivers a more natural light. It is similar to what Honor did on the Magic 7 Pro, and it is noticeable when using the device next to the F6 Pro. <br><br>The F7 Ultra also gets 3840Hz PWM dimming, and this is a welcome move. Xiaomi and other Chinese brands are doing all the right things when it comes to eye care on their devices, and it's good to see the F7 Ultra get the full suite of features. Xiaomi's always-on styles aren't quite as extensive as what you get with ColorOS or Funtouch OS, but you get a decent selection, and you can choose to have the mode enabled throughout the day or set up a custom schedule.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zsYgjDkxRVNDQAF4Ve3kwb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra icons on the home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zsYgjDkxRVNDQAF4Ve3kwb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the F7 Ultra gets a dedicated VisionBoost D7 chip that optimizes video playback and delivers smoother visuals while gaming, with POCO positioning 120fps gaming as a clear differentiator. On that subject, gaming is a delight on the device, with the phone able to handle demanding titles without any hassle whatsoever.</p>
<p>It holds up just as well with multimedia content; HDR rendering is handled well, and there's a noticeable difference to last year when it comes to brightness levels and color fidelity. POCO is using a custom Shield Glass solution — similar to what Xiaomi does on its own devices — and in my use, the phone didn't have any issues even after several tumbles.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LyGme3q9Ma589jBLNDzxkb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra about page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyGme3q9Ma589jBLNDzxkb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've always enjoyed using POCO's devices because of the powerful hardware, and the F7 Ultra is in a league of its own. Thanks to the latest Qualcomm silicon, the phone holds its own against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">Zenfone 12 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>. Similar to those devices, I didn't see any issues with the F7 Ultra in regular use; the phone handled mundane tasks without breaking a sweat, and even visually-intensive titles didn't tax the hardware to any noticeable degree. <br><br>The hardware tends to run hotter — this is the case with all Qualcomm-powered phones this year — and there is overheating during extended gaming sessions. That said, it doesn't get so hot as to become uncomfortable to hold. It's clear that Qualcomm increased power limits this year, and that is evident when using the phone next to previous iterations. The plus side is that you get better gaming performance, with rock-solid framerates.</p>

<p>POCO is using the Surge T1S chip to deliver better connectivity, and although I didn't see any difference when using the F7 Ultra on my home network, it had a stronger signal over cellular data. The phone has Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0 — just like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra — NFC, AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless, and LHDC codecs. In short, you don't miss out on anything on the connectivity side of things. <br><br>The vibration motor is quite good too, and while it isn't as detailed as the one on the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, it has good feedback when using the keyboard — certainly much better than previous POCO phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="izSjvxuUnQPQjvp6t2F9gb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra back view on blue background with yellow colors next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/izSjvxuUnQPQjvp6t2F9gb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a lot to like with the battery as well. The 5300mAh battery easily manages to last a day with relative ease, and even with heavy use, I didn't have to worry about battery running out before the end of the day. POCO is also using silicon battery tech this time, and it allows the brand to deliver a bigger battery in a smaller size — always a good thing. <br><br>The phone gets 120W charging, and it takes 38 minutes to charge the battery. You'll need to enable the Boost charging mode to unlock 120W charging, with the phone using 90W in regular use. Overall, this is the best hardware package in the sub-$800 category, and like previous years, POCO absolutely dominates the value.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-ultra-cameras"><span>POCO F7 Ultra: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZwUvgeGxCQwNSkgHwtp8Zb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra camera island in-hand view against blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZwUvgeGxCQwNSkgHwtp8Zb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO was always upfront about the cameras on its phones; while its devices did a decent enough job, imaging just wasn't a priority for the brand. That's thankfully changing with the F7 Ultra; the phone has the same 50MP Light Fusion camera as last year, and it's using the same OmniVision OVX8000 module with OIS. What's different is the auxiliary lenses; there's now a 50MP Samsung JN5 tele lens with 2.5x optical zoom and OIS, and a 32MP wide-angle lens. <br><br>Just with the addition of the auxiliary lenses, the F7 Ultra has the best camera package of any POCO device by a considerable margin. Video shooting is much better too; you get 8K24 in addition to 4K60, and video quality is leagues better than earlier POCO phones. The camera interface hasn't changed much, so if you've used a Xiaomi or POCO phone in the past, you'll know your way around the viewfinder.</p>

<p>Daylight photos taken with the F7 Ultra have good detail and color rendition, and there are absolutely no issues in this regard. While it is using the same module as last year, changes to the tuning mean you get much better shots, and this is evident in low-light and challenging scenarios. In short, the phone doesn't have any shortcomings when it comes to the main camera, and it does a brilliant job in this regard. <br><br>While the auxiliary lenses aren't as good, they're much better than any other POCO phone I used until now. The phone delivers clean photos at 2.5x and usable shots up to 5x, and wide-angle shots have good colors. The wide-angle lens has its drawbacks in low-light situations, but on the whole, this is a vastly better showing than previous years. <br><br>Ultimately, the F7 Ultra doesn't quite measure up to the OnePlus 13, Find X8, Vivo X200, and Xiaomi 15, but the cameras don't feel like a limitation any longer — that in itself is a huge deal.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5rYn3au5Ama8uuRZ8s8izb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra Android 15 Easter egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rYn3au5Ama8uuRZ8s8izb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn't much to talk about on the software front; the device features HyperOS 2.0.4.0 out of the box, and it uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> as the foundation. As I used the Xiaomi 15 Ultra before switching over, the software is pretty much identical; POCO does a few things differently when it comes to icons, but other than that, it is the same software as every other Xiaomi phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mPmgyidbGwModmtNeRK5mb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra notification pane with YouTube Music and Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPmgyidbGwModmtNeRK5mb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the interface itself hasn't changed too much over the last two years, it has better fluidity, and that is immediately noticeable when using the F7 Ultra against older POCO phones. I still don't like the split notification pane, but I'm used to it by now, and it is easily customizable. The software itself has plenty of customizability in general, and that's thankfully something that hasn't changed on POCO's phones. <br><br>There is still some bloatware, but nowhere as much as years past, and it can be easily uninstalled. POCO says it will deliver four Android OS updates alongside six years of security updates to the F7 Ultra and F7 Pro, and that is good to see. While it isn't quite as much as what Google, Samsung, and Honor deliver, it is still a decent move. That said, the device isn't likely to get Android 16 well after its release; POCO takes its time to roll out software updates, and it needs to change that.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-ultra-the-alternatives"><span>POCO F7 Ultra: The alternatives</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DzBHCZjFH26FiDRuAuxRwb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="Back view of POCO F7 Ultra next to F7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DzBHCZjFH26FiDRuAuxRwb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best alternative to the F7 Ultra is the F7 Pro; the phone has the same design, same panel, same main camera at the back, and same software. The auxiliary cameras aren't anywhere as good, and while it isn't quite as fast, you don't notice any difference even while gaming. As a bonus, the F7 Pro has a bigger 6000mAh battery, and even though it gets 90W charging instead of 120W, you're not actually missing out much. All things considered, the F7 Pro is a fabulous value at $499. <br><br>I like the OnePlus 13 a lot; it has one of the best camera packages in this category, and the design is stunning. Coming in at $899, it is $250 costlier than the F7 Ultra, and I'd suggest getting it if you need better cameras; otherwise, the F7 Ultra is a better choice in most areas.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>POCO F7 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5ZM4giSbQ5BdA66N9Cu9xb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra back view on blue background with yellow colors next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ZM4giSbQ5BdA66N9Cu9xb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a phone with the latest hardware</li><li>You want decent cameras at the back</li><li>You need a high-end phone with the best value</li><li>You need reliable battery life</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need timely software updates</li><li>You want the best cameras</li></ul>
<p>POCO did it once again — the F7 Ultra is proof that you don't need to shell out a ridiculous amount of money to get a great phone. The phone loses some of the flamboyance that characterized POCO devices in the past, but that's ultimately a good thing; it looks much more like a mainstream phone now. <br><br>The hardware is a clear differentiator; this is the most affordable way to get your hands on the latest Qualcomm silicon, and that in itself is highly alluring. Combine that with a high-quality OLED panel and all-day battery life with 120W charging, and the F7 Ultra nails the basics. <br><br>It also has the best cameras of any POCO phone yet. I know that doesn't mean much as the brand didn't prioritize imaging in the past, but it definitely makes a difference, and it gives the F7 Ultra a sizeable lead over its predecessors. POCO still has a way to go before it can measure up to OPPO, Vivo, Honor, and OnePlus, but this is a big step in the right direction. <br><br>Ultimately, there isn't much to criticize with the device. POCO did all the right things with the hardware and cameras, and while the software isn't quite as good, there's no denying that the F7 Ultra is a definite bargain. If you need the best value while still getting flagship internals, the F7 Ultra is the phone to buy in 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has been the center of several leaks recently, considering it's inching closer to launch— that is expected to happen on April 16 according to previous chatter. Samsung also showcased the phone more vividly at the MWC this year, multiple devices only in the silver colorway were suspended by a mental wire.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/the-galaxy-s25-edge-might-surprise-with-higher-prices-for-certain-models" target="_blank">We</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/the-galaxy-s25-edge-might-surprise-with-higher-prices-for-certain-models"> were aware</a> that the phone could come in a Titanium build according to previous leaks, showcasing the "Titanium Jet Black," "Titanium Silver," and "Titanium Icy Blue," similar to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. This is the first time we got to see how they would look in the above-mentioned colorways, thanks to official-looking renders from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,149881.html">WinFuture.</a></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GqsKf64SdjS5S3RWb4DWAD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-Colorways" alt="Titanium colorways of Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqsKf64SdjS5S3RWb4DWAD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WinFuture)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Previous rumors indicated that the phone would have all ceramic on its back panel with an Armor Aluminum frame to make sure it weathers the wear and tear of daily usage, considering it is said to be 5.84mm thin. But now, with these new renders from WinFuture, it seems like the company has taken the Titanium route to make sure they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-wants-to-avoid-a-bendgate-disaster-with-a-durable-galaxy-s25-edge" target="_blank">avoid a bend gate disaster</a>, although the exact materials used are still unconfirmed.</p><p>Since the time this phone was dropped at the end of this year's Unpacked Event in January, we've been privy to almost all of its specs in the recent past. To start, the phone is said to have a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>. However, the device is said to come with a smaller 3900mAh battery compared to the rest of the Galaxy S25 series (with some rumors pointing to a 4,000mAh unit).</p><p>We currently have no information about the device's charging speeds or its compatibility with Qi2 chargers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5PeWRDanM36qRK29WFqjoB" name="Screenshot- Samsung-galaxy-S25-Edge" alt="Screenshot of the new Samsung Galaxy Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5PeWRDanM36qRK29WFqjoB.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, the device will feature two rear cameras: reportedly a primary 200MP lens and a 12MP lens for ultrawide shots, along with a selfie camera, which we don't have much information about. The device is said to come with two storage options: 256GB and 512GB, which will both have 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Titanium build phones are usually on the higher end of the cost spectrum, and considering the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge could be one of them, we heard chatter that the 256GB model could cost €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400), while the 512GB version might hit €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520), respectively.</p><p>Recently, YouTuber <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I6XJPnji3o" target="_blank">Alexis Garza</a> was lucky enough to take this phone for a spin and put it through<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finalwire.aida64&hl=en" target="_blank"> the AIDA64 app</a>, which provides hardware and software information as well as diagnostic information for Android devices. While confirming the above-mentioned specs, Garza stated that the phone will also support Bluetooth 5.4</p><p>As much as these leaks look like the real deal, they should still be taken with a grain of salt, as some of these features might not show up on the actual device.</p>

<p>Once scattered throughout the month, Google is now bundling new Workspace features into monthly feature drops. The March 2025 Workspace feature drop is here, packing one feature previously announced and a few brand new ones.</p><p>The updates were revealed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/march-workspace-feature-drop?e=48754805" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, March 26, and include new language support in Workspace apps, expanded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> meeting notes, and inline Google Chat translation.</p>
<h2 id="upgraded-language-support-in-workspace-inline-google-chat-translation-2">Upgraded language support in Workspace, inline Google Chat translation</h2>
<p>This month's feature drop includes more support for languages in Workspace apps, specifically in Gemini integrations. For instance, Gemini's "Translate for me" feature now supports over 120 languages in Google Chat. The service can automatically detect and translate inline text, allowing users to view the original text or translated text with a single click.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.98%;"><img id="oYwKckApkLS4yHfBKocgRK" name="Translate-For-Me-Google-Chat" alt="Inline translation with Gemini in Google Chat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oYwKckApkLS4yHfBKocgRK.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1383" height="871" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Previously, users would've had to use Google Translate to translate foreign languages separately. This could save Google Chat users time, as they can quickly view translations for the vast number of supported languages directly in their conversation.</p><p>Additionally, the Gemini side panel in most Workspace apps now supports more languages. Gmail, Docs, Slides, and Sheets will work with a total of 29 supported languages, with the full list below:</p>
<ul><li>Arabic</li><li>Catalan</li><li>Chinese</li><li>Czech</li><li>Danish</li><li>Dutch</li><li>English</li><li>Finnish</li><li>French</li><li>German</li><li>Greek</li><li>Hebrew</li><li>Hungarian</li><li>Indonesian</li><li>Italian</li><li>Japanese</li><li>Korean</li><li>Malay</li><li>Norwegian</li><li>Polish</li><li>Portuguese</li><li>Romanian</li><li>Russian</li><li>Spanish</li><li>Swedish</li><li>Thai</li><li>Turkish</li><li>Ukrainian</li><li>Vietnamese</li></ul>
<p>Google Chat's Gemini side panel is a bit more limited, with only eight languages currently supported. You can view the full list of supported languages for each Gemini in Workspace feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/14925782" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-s-meeting-notes-now-identify-action-items-2">Gemini's meeting notes now identify action items</h2>
<p>Separately, Google is adding a final section to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-gemini-note-taking-feature">meeting notes generated by "Take notes for me" with Gemini</a> in Google Meet. Currently, using the Take notes for me feature will generate a Google Doc that recaps a virtual meeting without participants or hosts lifting a finger. It includes quick links to meeting attendees, recordings, and transcripts, as well as a basic summary with important details listed separately.</p><p>Now, the company is adding a new dimension to Gemini's meeting notes with "Suggested next steps." At the end of the document created with Take notes for me, you'll see a Suggested next steps section with important action items.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.99%;"><img id="3q6arVi3HtzzahYeMZSHMA" name="Google-Meet-Gemini-Notes" alt="Next steps in Google Meet "take notes for me."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3q6arVi3HtzzahYeMZSHMA.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="1075" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google says these can be edited or assigned to specific team members. If selected, the list of meeting notes can include the full transcript and will be sent to participants via Gmail. Last month, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-gets-scrollable-captions-to-help-you-stay-in-the-loop-during-calls">added support for scrollable captions</a> to make catching up on a live transcript easier.</p>
<h2 id="plus-google-vids-can-create-voiceovers-with-ai-2">Plus, Google Vids can create voiceovers with AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1810px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.67%;"><img id="ZMZrFa8qNuKwwP6eM7Td6T" name="Adding new capabilities to Google Vids’ ‘Help me create’" alt="Generating a VoiceOver with Google Vids." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMZrFa8qNuKwwP6eM7Td6T.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1810" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vids-can-now-generate-ai-voiceovers-for-your-videos">As announced last week</a>, Google Vids is also getting an upgrade to its "Help me create" tool. This previously allowed users to generate a video and a voiceover script with AI.  The latest Vids feature can take that AI-generated script and turn it into a real voiceover, saving recording time.</p>
<p>Some of the features included in the March 2025 Google Workspace feature drop may require a paid Workspace account, either via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a> or a work or school plan. It can take weeks or longer for the features to roll out for everyone, depending on their release schedule.</p>

And while it's great being able to play games right on your phone, it's not the most comfortable experience. Even just playing games for a few minutes usually ends up with me either being annoyed that my fingers are in the way or my wrists start to bother me. Thankfully, I have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir G8 Plus</a> at my disposal, and now you can get one too, as it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN/"><strong>dropped to its lowest price ever</strong></a> as part of Amazon's Big Spring Sale.</p>

<p>Heading into 2025, things were looking pretty bleak for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">Android emulation</a> scene. Nintendo took down multiple Switch emulators, and there just wasn't much progress being made for other platforms. Fast forward to today, and while things are looking slightly better on the Switch front, it's also now possible to play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3</a> AND Windows games right on your phone.</p><p>Of course, after you get everything set up, using the on-screen controls isn't exactly ideal. This is just one of the reasons why I always recommend picking up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">game controller</a> that you can use to create a Switch-like mobile gaming experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-5" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom via Sudachi with the GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there's definitely no shortage of options to choose from, the GameSir G8 Plus is always the first controller I recommend. For one, it works with practically every device that I have, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> with its enormous 14.6-inch display.</p><p>Of course, not everyone is going to use a tablet of that size to play games, but it does speak to the versatility offered by the G8 Plus. Speaking of which, one of the big reasons why I prefer the G8 Plus over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">G8 Galileo</a> (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G8-Galileo-Controller-Joysticks/dp/B0CM3C9HRG/">which is also on sale</a>) is that I don't have to worry about the USB-C port getting in the way. This way, I can slot in my phone, start playing, and then stop playing just as quickly.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> is gaining a few new features on Android that make customizing your personalized radio stations and playlist cover art easier. "Ask Music," a feature that lets users create custom stations based on their mood using simple prompts, can now be further refined after the first try. It's rolling out this week for YouTube Premium subscribers in supported regions.</p><p>The process for creating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-is-testing-letting-you-build-custom-radio-stations-using-ai-prompts">Ask Music</a> starts with a prompt that describes their mood, like the examples YouTube provides of "upbeat workout tracks" or "relaxing jazz." From there, you'll get a custom radio station that helps with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">discovery of the streaming service's 100-million-track catalog</a>.</p><p>What's new with YouTube Music's latest update is the ability to further refine Ask Music radio stations after the initial prompt. Users can tweak their personalized radio stations by either typing or speaking additional prompts. The app will show chips with suggestion prompts to help YouTube Music users come up with ideas, such as "more upbeat," "just jazz songs" or "only female vocals."</p>

<p>Right now, YouTube says that Ask Music is only available for YouTube Music Premium subscribers in the following supported regions: U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. It'll work on both the Android and iOS mobile apps, too.</p><p>YouTube Premium subscribers in the U.S. will get one more exclusive feature, and that's AI-generated titles for My Mix playlist. Based on the songs included in the My Mix playlist, YouTube Music's AI will come up with a title that represents the mood and feel of the playlist.</p><p>Finally, YouTube Music is adding new support for custom cover art for playlists. There are two new AI-generated cover art themes — "Workout" and "Instruments" — that can be used to create unique artwork. Additionally, custom playlist thumbnails, which were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-custom-playlist-thumbnails">first available on the web</a>, are now supported on the Android app. They'll be launching on iOS in the coming months, per the company.</p><p>These updates are rolling out this week on the YouTube Music app for Android.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'm never good at remembering when Mother's Day is, and while I never miss it, it always catches me off guard a bit. However, this year, I'm ready, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-big-spring-sale-2025-best-deals-for-android">Amazon's Big Spring Sale</a> is here to help me get started with pretty nice deals on some useful tech products and accessories that I'm sure my mother will love.</p><p>One of the more significant purchases I'm planning is the Pixel Watch 3. This watch normally retails for $349.99 for the 41mm Wi-Fi model, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9138ZXM/">this deal shaves $60 off</a>, meaning you can strap the watch for less than $300. It's not the lowest price we've seen the Pixel Watch 3, which dipped to $279 during Black Friday, but I can manage the $10 difference. Wear OS is largely devoid of good cheap smartwatches, so any discount is always worth looking at.</p>

<p>So why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>? Aside from it being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, my mother has been asking for new watch bands for her Fitbit, and being the loving son that I am, I would much rather upgrade her device instead. She has some fitness goals she's working toward, and a new smartwatch that integrates Fitbit and has access to her favorite music streaming services feels like a win.</p><p>Plus, she and I can have matching smartwatches. I've been using the Pixel Watch 3 since it launched in October, and I love this smartwatch. It's fluid, designed extremely well, and has a surprisingly impressive battery life. I also find the AI-generated workouts to be quite useful and a good motivation.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> is also on sale in case the latest model is a bit more than you'd like to spend. While not as good as the Pixel Watch 3, this model was an improvement over the original, with better battery life and accurate heart rate monitoring. And with this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCQ4BX4T">Big Spring Sale discount</a>, you can get it for less than $200, which is pretty good.</p>

<h2 id="other-tech-accessories-i-m-getting-for-mother-s-day-2">Other tech accessories I'm getting for Mother's Day</h2>
<p>While I can't always get my mom the latest tech gadgets, she always appreciates when I can, and she always trusts my judgment. That's why I want to get her a couple of additional trinkets that I noticed are on sale for the Amazon Big Spring Sale.</p><p>She really enjoys listening to music whenever she's out and about, but she has bad luck choosing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> that work well or fit her ears comfortably. That's why the Soundcore Sport X20 caught my eye, as they feature the ear hook design that she prefers.</p><p>They also have long battery life, IP68 water and dust resistance, and ANC, which is honestly pretty sweet for earbuds that you can get for just $64.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="78588632-db89-44ff-8788-113886f6466e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="These Soundcore earbuds are already surprisingly good for their price, but a 20% discount only sweetens the pot for anyone looking for affordable headphones." data-dimension48="These Soundcore earbuds are already surprisingly good for their price, but a 20% discount only sweetens the pot for anyone looking for affordable headphones." data-dimension25="$63.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRT6HQ82" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="rrPsRKTR4oC8tmrUzYKiDo" name="Soundcore-Sport-X20" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rrPsRKTR4oC8tmrUzYKiDo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1017" height="1017" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>These Soundcore earbuds are already surprisingly good for their price, but a 20% discount only sweetens the pot for anyone looking for affordable headphones.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRT6HQ82" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="78588632-db89-44ff-8788-113886f6466e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="These Soundcore earbuds are already surprisingly good for their price, but a 20% discount only sweetens the pot for anyone looking for affordable headphones." data-dimension48="These Soundcore earbuds are already surprisingly good for their price, but a 20% discount only sweetens the pot for anyone looking for affordable headphones." data-dimension25="$63.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>I'm also going to grab her the Anker Nano Power Bank. This is something I always like to point out whenever it's on sale because of how much I love this product. I carry it around with me all the time, and the built-in cord with the loop design comes in clutch!</p><p>With the 10,000mAh capacity, she'll have enough juice to power up her phone, new earbuds, and even my little brother's phone if he's been playing too many games on it. And the little display will always let her know how much power it has left or how long it will take to charge up a device.</p>

<hr>
<p>A surge of reports all contain users voicing issues with Google's recent Pixel flagships and alarms.</p><p>Many Google Pixel users took to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jir4tz/all_of_my_alarms_turned_themselves_off_over_the/">respective subreddit</a> to begin reporting issues with their previously set alarms not going off as intended (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/26/google-pixel-failed-alarm-clock-reports/">9to5Google</a>). Posted two days ago, one user states their alarms on their Pixel never went off. In fact, they had set four alarms, and all four were "turned off," not dismissed. The user did some testing and stated they turned their alarms off and on, which seemingly worked the following day.</p><p>However, each alarm soon deactivated itself after that on the following day.</p><p>Users are scrambling to figure out what the issue is as others in the thread note a similar problem. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jir4tz/comment/mjha9mf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user states</a> they wonder if it has anything to do with a Gemini notification. Their post reads, "My initial assumption was that I told Gemini to stop a timer that was going off and it canceled all my alarms."</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jg2nz3/my_alarm_did_not_go_off_today/?rdt=57617">separate thread</a> gives a little more clarity on the affected devices, as the original poster states their alarms didn't go off on a Pixel 9. The user states the alarm that was deactivated was for work throughout the week and had been "working for years until now." Several more users with a Pixel 9 series device report the same issue.</p><p>Curiously, other users state they've encountered these issues <em>after </em>downloading the latest March 2025 feature drop.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jg2nz3/my_alarm_did_not_go_off_today">My alarm did not go off today.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>This is a truly strange problem going around. As always, even if you haven't experienced issues, please check your Pixel phone's alarms before you go to bed. Moreover, Google hasn't made a statement about this issue, but these user reports may get its attention and will (hopefully) lead to a future fix.</p><p>Users highlighting these alarm issues after the March feature drop makes sense <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">when you consider the struggles</a> some have been going through. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">update arrived</a> on March 4, but shortly after, users started reporting annoying brightness problems, audio issues, and inconsistent vibrations. The problem affected users with devices ranging from the Pixel 7 to the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>There were some band-aid fixes mentioned for the brightness and vibration issues, though. Similar to what we've seen reported with the Pixel alarms, another patch is expected to help give these users some relief.</p><p>Google's latest feature drop was packed with new features like scam detection in the Messages and Phone apps. The company also expanded its Satellite SOS support to more regions like Canada and Europe. Additionally, the Pixel Watch 3 gained Loss of Pulse and menstrual cycle tracking.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster spotted Samsung's One UI 7 schedule in a Czech Republic post, with specific dates for its rollout for several Galaxy devices.</li><li>The Galaxy S24, Flip 6, and Fold 6 are set to receive it first on April 10, followed by the Galaxy S24 FE, S23, Flip 5, and Fold 5 "a week later."</li><li>One UI 7's initial rollout seemingly lines up with Samsung's announced date for the U.S.; however, we wouldn't hold our breath.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amid a little One UI 7 rollout confusion, Samsung is now bringing clarity to the specifics behind its next OS debut.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1904787401488080960">Tarun Vats on X</a>, the company has posted a detailed schedule of its One UI 7 rollout for several past-gen Galaxy devices (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/26/samsung-one-ui-7-schedule-dates/">9to5Google</a>). Samsung's Czech Republic website has posted the dates for which devices should begin expecting the major OS upgrade. The post states April 10 will mark the beginning of One UI 7's arrival on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Flip 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a> in the region.</p><p>Officially, the Czech Republic's post states "a week later" (potentially April 17), the Galaxy S24 FE, S23 series, Flip 5, and Fold 5 will receive the update. This will then be followed by One UI 7's arrival on the S23 FE and the S22 "in the coming weeks," which is speculated to be late April.</p><p>Samsung's post lists its eligible Galaxy tablets separately, beginning with the Galaxy Tab S10 series, which should see One UI 7 in mid-April. Lastly, the Tab S9 and S8 series will grab it in late April.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Czech Republic: One UI 7 Rollout Schedule 📅 April 10 – Galaxy S24, Z Flip6 & Z Fold6 📅 Week Later– Galaxy S24 FE, S23 series, Z Flip5 & Z Fold5 📅 Late April – Galaxy S23 FE, S22📱Tablets🔹 Mid-April: Galaxy Tab S10 series 🔹 Late April: Tab S9 & Tab S8 pic.twitter.com/njPZeHwmBo<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1904787401488080960">March 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>These dates could seriously matter for users in the U.S. since One UI 7's initial launch in the Czech Republic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">lines up with ours</a>. Samsung announced the U.S. will see the OS launch three days <em>after </em>its global release on April 7. However, it seems the Czech Republic has received this same date, which could mean the U.S. will see similar dates for the OS upgrade for consumers with eligible devices.</p><p>In that announcement, Samsung didn't state the reason behind the small delay for those in the U.S. The good news is the company confirmed a date for us eagerly awaiting the update after the Galaxy S24 series picked up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/the-galaxy-s24-ultras-new-one-ui-7-beta-is-crushing-bugs-before-its-april-debut">fifth One UI 7 beta</a>. The update cleaned up some glitchy lock screen notifications, small widget icons, and more.</p><p>However, Galaxy device owners should take this Czech Republic schedule with caution for the U.S. release, given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-us-deletes-april-10-one-ui-7-announcement-post">the strange confusion</a> with its blog post. The U.S. One UI 7 announcement post disappeared over the weekend before reappearing a day later. While speculation leans toward there having been a slight glitch on the website, others have noted Samsung's U.S. X account links to a "page not found" site.</p><p>We'll likely have to play things by ear (and eye) as we approach the extremely hopeful April 10 release date.</p>

<p>Samsung is due to release its next set of foldables sometime later this year at a summer Unpacked event, according to several rumors. While we don't have confirmation of the launch yet, several leaks seem to be dropping like hotcakes.</p><p>This time, the leak showcased alleged cases for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Firstly, in a post on Weibo, avid tipster IceUniverse posted several images of the alleged Galaxy Z Flip 7 (via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/samsung-phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-design-just-teased-in-new-cases-leak-and-the-outer-display-is-huge" target="_blank"> Tom's Guide</a>).

The renders also show us the rear cameras on the cover display that is expected to be a 50MP primary lens and a 12MP ultra-wide lens.</p><p>Additionally, IceUniverse posted four additional pictures on X that showcased real-life protective films and cases of the upcoming foldables. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 cases both black and clear seem to support the larger cover display it is said to come with, additionally, you see bumps for volume controls and the power button.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 Case and Fold7 Film pic.twitter.com/FuhOtl513K<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1904522103287881866">March 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>As for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">leaks indicate</a> that it could come with larger inner and outer displays, with a 6.5-inch cover screen and an 8.2-inch main screen. Samsung also gave us a major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">hint at this year's MWC</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7"> </a>where it demoed a "nameless" foldable placed next to the Galaxy Z Fold 6.  This prototype showcased a display with nearly no fold crease whatsoever.</p><p>The images of cases from IceUniverse also seem to back the rumor of a large screen for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and the case also looks slightly narrower according to the publication.</p><p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt, as we're still quite a few months from the potential launch of Samsung's next foldable phones.</p>

Having said that, the real issues don't stem from the software itself or the phones that will eventually receive the update; it's a matter of over-promising and under-delivering. Unfortunately, that's pretty common when the people doing the selling aren't the people doing the building.</p><p>There are three different camps here. I know this because I have spent the last three days reading whatever people had to say about it. I do not recommend it if you don't love the aftertaste of Tylenol.</p><p>One group of people is sharpening pitchforks while posting on websites like Reddit about how Samsung is terrible, and they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1iq53vc/for_the_people_who_are_leaving_samsung_because_of/" target="_blank">never buying another Samsung phone</a> again. Others are coping and making excuses for the whole mess while posting responses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1iw7go6/samsung_blames_google_for_delay_in_one_ui_70/" target="_blank">from Samsung Customer Care, blaming Google</a> for the rollout issues.</p><p>The third group? They don't care as long as things still work right now and won't break when they're told to update their software. I think everyone is right and everyone is wrong, all at the same time.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ymJGfhDJUFbqMEyqRGWMUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-11" alt="One UI 7 Quick Settings panel on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ymJGfhDJUFbqMEyqRGWMUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-starts-to-roll-out-in-select-markets">originally promised</a> to deliver the One UI 7 update to eligible Galaxy S phones in Q1 2025, which isn't going to happen. It will get here eventually — the latest says it's coming in April — but that doesn't address the real problem: writing software is hard, and unless you have done it, you have no idea how hard it can be.</p><p>Of course, seeing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> released with the update makes it especially hard for consumers to swallow.</p><p>I'm saying the real problems with the rollout of One UI 7 are all about communication, transparency, and setting expectations. It has nothing to do with features or options or anything technical.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-welcome" alt="One UI 7 welcome screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sitting in front of colorful plants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You may think using software another company makes for you, like Android (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">from Google</a>) or Windows (from Microsoft), is easy, but it's not. It could be if every company used the exact same configuration of hardware specifically designated by the company that wrote it, but then you'd have a more Apple-like situation where you can't choose what product fits you best. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not for everyone.</p><p>Android is especially difficult because it's so ... "loose." However, as long as you follow some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it" target="_blank">rules from Google</a>, you can do a lot with it to make it look and act like something completely different — enter One UI 7.</p><p>Samsung executives and project managers have a vision of what each version of One UI will be. They decide how it will look, what features will be improved, which new features are needed, and what features will be removed. They base this on the feedback you give while using your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> via data collection. The next version of One UI will be a mix of things that Samsung knows users like to interact with.</p><p>This isn't done in a vacuum. Managers, engineers, marketing, and even carrier representatives are involved in the decisions that go into the update and its release schedule. One side wants everything, and they want it now, while others are more timid and want more time. A compromise is reached, and a timeline is built. Then, the chaos and "crunch time" begin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yGgesVgwjpdeBv98iQNoHm" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-Samsung-Google-partnership.jpeg" alt="Samsung and Google execs stand on stage together at Galaxy Unpacked." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGgesVgwjpdeBv98iQNoHm.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The folks tasked with developing the ideas given to them from people up the chain need to find a way to do it all and try to do it by a given date. Samsung has historically been terrible at this, and I can't blame anyone at the company for it. Neither should you. It's a communication breakdown between the people making the promises and the people trying to fulfill them.</p><p>When you want to try and do too much, you need too much time. Integrating a new (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">though now a year old</a>) version of Android with a slew of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">AI parlor tricks</a> and a reinvented notification idea that will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-third-party-app-now-bar-support-report">include sports scores</a> and the kitchen sink is too much.</p><p>To top it all off, much of it will be discarded once a better way is introduced that's more integrated with Android. Split windows and one-handed mode come to mind. Samsung wants to be first, so it will race forward with an idea instead of waiting because that's a good way to sell more phones. If you are reading this on a Galaxy S phone, it probably worked on you.</p><p>None of this is a bad idea or anything you should be upset about. If you're upset, it's because you were told one thing and delivered a different thing. The overworked developers doing it aren't the people who told you what you would get and when you would get it. Welcome to marketing.</p>

<p>It will be here when it gets here. That's it; there is nothing more we need to know about it.</p><p>We <em><strong>want</strong></em> to know a lot more, though. We want to know a date and what to expect. We want to know that it won't have issues or be filled with bugs. We want it all, and we want it now. This goes for software updates from every company, not just Samsung.</p><p>I hate to break it to you, but it didn't get here when you wanted it, and once it does, there will be bugs. You may get angry and complain on the internet, and I can't blame you. Please complain about it the right way — Samsung needs to be more transparent and develop better communication with its customers before it tries to do anything else. The company has made great strides in software development over the past 10 years, and it's time to work on other things.</p>

<ul><li>Google reportedly "confirmed" to a publication that it will move to "privately" develop its Android OS and slow down its AOSP releases.</li><li>The main purpose of this is to "streamline" its process, as Google won't have to worry about "merging conflicts" with the AOSP as often.</li><li>Google is still expected to release its open source code on the AOSP as usual, but with a small change to its cadence.</li><li>Android 16 recently achieved Platform Stability ahead of its expected Q2 2025 launch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A curious report on the future development plans of Android from Google has surfaced, detailing its potential impact.</p><p>A report by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">Android Authority</a>) supposedly "confirms" Google will shift to privately developing the Android OS as soon as "next week." The claim that Google's audible to a "private" focus only seems to facilitate a more "streamlined" approach to its OS development. According to Rahman, this more privatized way of developing Android will have a "minimal" impact for end-users who await these updates once completed.</p><p>Additionally, developers, both those who create custom ROMs and others who contribute to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">AOSP</a>, will also see little impact.</p><p>Rahman claims this change will more directly impact Google and the AOSP (Android Open-Source Project). The company will allegedly "change the frequency of public source code releases for specific Android components." Rahman states that, with Google's normal public source code releases for the AOSP, the company needs to "spend time and effort merging patches."</p><p>The "merging" part is key as Rahman states conflict often arises between the two branches and the involved code. To avoid getting too technical, Google is required to patch these issues between its internal branch and the AOSP through its normal public source releases. Making its development more private will slow things down to help this happen less often.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TNbWP4ewgi7QWfcB6H7Yhe" name="Android-robot-mwc-01.jpg" alt="An Android robot at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TNbWP4ewgi7QWfcB6H7Yhe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rahman alleges nothing will change for developers looking forward to Android 16 as its open source code will see an expected release when it's ready. This makes sense as the entire purpose of the AOSP is for other developers to create their Android OS skins, like One UI from Samsung. However, since Google may take Android's software behind closed doors for longer (and more often), tipsters/leakers could find it harder to see what's coming.</p><p>Nothing has been directly confirmed yet from Google. The report alleges the company will make an official statement about this development change "later this week," so we'll see what happens.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">achieved an important milestone</a>: Platform Stability. Beta 3 rolled out for enrolled Pixels, bringing with it additional accessibility tools for low-vision users via Text Outline. The patch also includes "Local Network Protection," which lets users control what apps can access their device. Platform Stability is the last step before Android 16's grand rollout for users.</p><p>This step should consume the rest of March and April before the software drops in Q2 2025.</p>

<p>For years, Samsung has crafted some of the finest displays ever made by humankind. Ching Wan Tang and Steven Van Slyke might have created OLED technology at Eastman Kodak back in 1987, but it was Samsung who popularized its use in mobile devices with the launch of the original Samsung Galaxy line in 2010.</p><p>Over the years, however, Samsung has been slipping. Of course, you'd never know this by looking at smartphone display rankings on websites <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dxomark.com/smartphones/#sort-display">like DXOMark</a>, where 9 out of the top 10 smartphone displays are all made by Samsung. Look a little deeper, though, and you'll start to understand the real problem: these displays are built to rank at the top of charts by using some nasty tricks that cause users <strong>real pain</strong>.</p><p>It's a similar "cheating" concept we saw years ago when smartphone manufacturers would specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-cheat-android-benchmarks">tweak their phones' performance profiles</a> to push harder during a benchmark to achieve a top-rank score. The difference now is that it's not a company's pride on the line; it's our eyes.</p>

<p>HDR standards have been around for a long time and are commonplace on spec sheets. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">Even $200 phones</a> support the HDR10 standard, but not all of them achieve 10-bit color naturally. Rather, many phone displays — including the $1,300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> — only ship with a screen that can display 8-bit color.</p><p>As you might imagine, a pixel can't just magically jump from being able to display 256 shades of red, green, or blue up to 1024 shades unless it was built to do so. That's four times the number of each of the primary shades, which takes a significant engineering effort to create.</p><p>So, how does an 8-bit phone display achieve 10-bit color? By using something known as dithering, or more often known on displays as Frame Rate Control (FRC). You'll often see this on a spec sheet as "8bit + FRC" to represent the shift from 16.7 million colors — that's the total number of colors in an 8-bit palette — all the way up to 1.07 <strong>billion</strong> colors for 10-bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="ChK2zpLgKyiqsp5DsAVNfU" name="pixel-dithering-example" alt="An example of color dithering happening at the subpixel level on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ChK2zpLgKyiqsp5DsAVNfU.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you look closely at the above image I captured of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's display through a microscope, you can see FRC dithering in action. An 8-bit panel, like the one on this Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra pictured above, will quickly flash between two different hues to "create" a color that doesn't exist. I captured this video at 480FPS with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, which makes it possible to see the pixels flash more easily.</p><p>This phenomenon is possible thanks to the way our eyes work when they see a "moving" image. In video, pictures are often shown at 24 or 30 still images per second (frames per second), creating a smooth-looking movement. Likewise, color dithering flashes two colors to create a nonexistent color to our eyes, similar to spinning a color wheel.</p><p>For many people, this works to help create a sense of deeper or more vibrant colors. It's one of the ways Samsung ended up adding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-washed-out-display-is-intentional">a more vibrant color option</a> to the Galaxy S24 Ultra last year, and it's present on the S25 Ultra this year.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Tricks like PWM dimming and FRC color dithering are used to top display quality charts by fooling eyes and calibration equipment into seeing something that doesn't exist.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I spoke with Michael Hamilton, ISF calibration instructor at AVPro South, who helped explain why companies should try to use native 10-bit panels in premium products instead of resorting to 8-bit with FRC dithering.</p><p>"8-bit with Frame Rate Control does not do a very good job of preventing 'banding' and can still exhibit flicker or dithering (like in sky scenes where gradient transients are very subtle)," Hamilton explained.</p><p>"Additionally, when an 8-bit panel with FRC rapidly flashes, 'temporal' artifacts manifest such as a judder-like appearance to motion, or 'floating,' which areas of the image appear to be in motion [when they should not be] and directly adjacent areas are not, such as long-range shots of trees where some appear to be moving in a breeze while others are not, or an expansive water surface moves unnaturally and even the shoreline may appear to be moving.</p><p>Since they are not visible with a static image or patterns, a viewer may see ghosting or motion blur or otherwise motion glitches, and then, to confirm, they pause the video, and the anomaly subsides."</p><p>Hamilton works exclusively on TV calibration, where banding is more noticeable because of the size of the panel. Because of its size, it's unlikely you'll ever notice banding on a smartphone screen, but that hasn't stopped some Redditors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS25Ultra/comments/1ihdwwx/banding_on_25_ultra_is_non_existent_in_irl_it/">from pointing it out</a>.</p>

<p>This methodology is clever from an engineering perspective, but it presents two problems. First off, Samsung is cheating you out of your money by using an 8-bit panel on a $1,300 phone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> uses a true 10-bit panel that doesn't need to dither to show all 1.07 billion colors for the HDR10 standard and provides the same seven-year software update commitment as Samsung.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 does the same thing for even less, even if it <em>only</em> gets six years of software updates. Despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-needs-to-fix-four-major-s24-ultra-display-problems">all the display problems</a> with the Galaxy S24 Ultra last year, Samsung is still using the same M13 AMOLED panel on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, just with a few software hacks to mask the problems it's having with display manufacturing quality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung is putting profit margins ahead of the health of its users, particularly the ones most susceptible to the ill effects of display flicker.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Second, and maybe most egregiously, Samsung's use of color dithering causes some users real pain. This is a similar effect to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, another problem Samsung displays suffer from. Samsung uses low-Hz PWM dimming to save money and achieve a very specific display metric at different brightness intervals.</p><p>Hamilton also explained a few reasons companies use PWM dimming on TVs, although the same concept transfers over to phones:</p><p>"By rapidly flashing the backlight LEDs on and off, a less expensive power supply may be used. The byproduct of this is 'flicker,' which tends to vary depending on the picture mode. Some viewers detect this strobing and flashing, and with fast-moving objects, blurring or 'comet tailing' can be seen.</p><p>Uniformity issues tend to be exacerbated by fewer backlight zones due to cost reduction, and the image can look unevenly illuminated and unnatural in some scenes. These issues can be overcome: just 'bring money.'"</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung is designing its displays for measurement and calibration tools, not the humans who actually use them.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The end is the most illuminating aspect here. Samsung is putting profit margins ahead of the health of its users, particularly the ones most susceptible to the ill effects of display flicker.</p><p>The rest of the industry knows and understands the problems that color dithering and low-Hz PWM dimming can have on some users and has enacted positive change for everyone.</p><p>There's a reason companies like BOE and Visionox — which are found on phones from companies like Nothing, OnePlus, Honor, Motorola, and more — are making OLED panels with native 10-bit reproduction and support for both DC-dimming and significantly faster PWM dimming when needed.</p><p>The Honor Magic 7 Pro is capable of 4320Hz PWM dimming at low brightness while the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra uses 480Hz dimming at all brightness levels. There's a clear spec difference here on multiple levels, and Samsung isn't winning any awards for having the best hardware. Just the best tricks to achieve a specific goal.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Google added colorblind modes to Android L all the way back in 2014, and there's no reason the company can't add a way to disable color dithering or display flickering at the system level.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Aside from pure profit margins, companies like Samsung Display choose to use PWM dimming and dithering on OLED screens because of how the tech works. Because OLED response time is in nanoseconds, unlike LCD, engineers have learned that dialing in the display calibration can achieve near-perfect scores on display quality tests. In other words, Samsung is designing its displays for measurement and calibration tools, not the humans who actually use them.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/dylan-raga/">Dylan Raga</a>, a display reviewer at XDA Developers, explained it very well. Speaking on the subject of calibration and color matching, he told me that "the best current strobeless solution would be for native 10bpc panels with multiple well-calibrated voltage states, using pixel-level dimming in-between them with active spatial DPU dithering."</p><p>In other words, Samsung is doing <em>exactly</em> what's needed to achieve the best scores on display tests, and therein lies the problem.</p><p>Raga went on to say that "a true 12-bit DAC would be ideal, but we’re not really near having those on consumer displays. Our only options that maintain reference picture quality involve using a higher base power for better signal control and modulating it down by some means."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Many display companies have acknowledged the problems that color and light flickering can cause, but, as usual, Samsung, Google, and Apple seem oblivious.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>At this juncture, it seems we're presented with two main solutions to this problem: make displays more like BOE and Visionox or provide users with accessibility options that allow them to disable any "display quality" features that cause them physical harm.</p><p>These other OLED manufacturers have slowly improved their display quality over time while offering eye-friendly options like DC-dimming, which can lower display quality on OLEDs at some brightness levels but always reduce eye strain.</p><p>However, until companies like Google, Apple, and Samsung acknowledge the problem, we're stuck with phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and Galaxy S25 Ultra. Both of these phones top the charts for display quality because of the tricks they use to achieve these metrics. Thankfully, plenty of other companies have acknowledged these problems, but, as usual, it's the big three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">that refuse to accept the science</a>.</p><p>Google added colorblind modes to Android L <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-l-includes-new-display-modes-color-blind-users">all the way back in 2014</a>, and there's no reason the company can't add a way to disable color dithering or display flickering at the system level. Google has the power to set these accessibility options for users at the operating system level, but the company seems clueless about a problem that most of the industry has actively acknowledged. What's it going to take, Google? Samsung? Apple? The ball is in your court.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need an all-flash NAS with powerful internals, good thermals, and ultra-fast connectivity. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the best software features.</p>
<p>The best part of the F8 SSD Plus is that it isn't anywhere as bulky as traditional NAS servers. As it doesn't need to house 3.5-inch drive slots, TerraMaster managed to create a design that's about the size of a router, but you still get eight M.2 slots with good passive and active cooling. You get thermal pads in the packaging to mount over any SSDs you install, and they do a good job ensuring the drives don't overheat. <br><br>There are no issues with connectivity either; the NAS has a 10GbE port at the back, and you get a solitary USB-C port alongside dual USB-A and an HDMI port. The NAS is powered by an 8-core Intel Core i3, and it has 16GB of RAM out of the box; clearly, this is overkill as a Plex server, and it does an outstanding job with 4K media and concurrent streams.<br><br>The only issue is that the software doesn't have the most polished set of features, but you can easily switch over to TrueNAS and install it if you wish to do so. Overall, the F8 SSD Plus is the best of the all-flash NAS models around, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F8-SSD-Plus-NAS/dp/B0D9HWLDX5">at $699</a>, it is a better value than its rivals.</p>
