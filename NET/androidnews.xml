For right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Ear-Integration-Cancelling-Equaliser/dp/B0CXPR5412" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon has cut 46% off the price of the Nothing Ear (a) earbuds</strong></a>, bringing the already affordable pair down to just $59. <strong>The catch is that this Lightning deal ends tonight, so you better act fast!</strong></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-a-review">Nothing's Ear (a) earbuds</a> offer a basic ANC audio profile, along with support for hi-res codecs like LDAC, and customization options including EQ and sound presets. In particular, the yellow version of the buds are some of our favorites due to their unique and sporty design, though this deal is also available for both the white and black models.</p><p>To be sure, these are almost a budget pair of earbuds already, so overall audio quality and ANC aren't going to be anything too mind-blowing. However, they're still better than just about anything you'd normally find around this price point, especially if you don't need something high-end but still want some bells and whistles.</p><p>Add in decent battery life, a USB-C charging case, and basic water and dust resistance, and you're looking at a pretty solid option for the under $60 price point.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$109.00" data-dimension48="$109.00" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Ear-Integration-Cancelling-Equaliser/dp/B0CXPR5412" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="c9cvUbLeKA4yu8hctXVQME" name="Nothing-Ear-a-square-product-block.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c9cvUbLeKA4yu8hctXVQME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Nothing Ear (a):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Ear-Integration-Cancelling-Equaliser/dp/B0CXPR5412" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$109.00" data-dimension48="$109.00" data-dimension25=""><del>$109.00</del> <strong>$59.00 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon's latest earbud deal is this 46% discount on the Nothing Ear (a) earbuds, bringing their price down to just $59. Despite the low discount price, these still come with a USB-C charging case, a long battery life, ANC, and still other extra features, making this a certifiably good deal.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Ear-Integration-Cancelling-Equaliser/dp/B0CXPR5412" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$109.00" data-dimension48="$109.00" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>your top priority is having a low price point on earbuds, but you still want a pair with a stylish design, a solid battery life, and decent features like ANC and EQ customization; you want earbuds with some kind of gaming, lagless listening modes; you prefer earbuds with a stalk, Airpods-style design but with a silicone ear tip.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best earbuds</a> on the market or those with industry-leading ANC quality; you'd prefer to go with Pixel, Galaxy, or other brand earbuds that come with seamless integration with other devices of the same brand; you need earbuds that support Qi wireless charging, rather than just USB-C charging.</p><p>The Nothing Ear (a) wireless earbuds offer a worthy, low-priced model to the company's broader lineup. They also include up to 42.5 hours of playtime when intermittently using the charging case, up to 9.5 hours between charges without ANC, or up to 5.5 hours with the feature turned on.</p><p>Additionally, the Ear (a) buds come with an IP54 water and dust resistance rating, an IPX2 rating for the case, and seamless integration with ChatGPT and more. As for audio, users also get access to EQ and sound preset options using the mobile app.</p><p>Perhaps the largest downside with these earbuds is their lack of Qi wireless charging support, though this is a pretty great price point for those who don't mind that.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Galetti shared the information through a blog post, stating Amazon has laid off 16,000 employees. This comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction">on the heels of its October layoffs</a>, when the company let go of 14,000 people. Galetti states that the 16,000 people being laid off this month will impact roles across Amazon.</p><p>Anyone in the U.S. who's been impacted by this is said to have been given 90 days to "look for a new role internally." However, if some would rather not search for a new role within the company, Galetti says Amazon will provide "severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits (as applicable), and more."</p><p>While this is the second massive way of layoffs by Amazon in recent times, Galetti says this "will not" become a regular occurrence. Instead, Galetti states Amazon will "evaluate" systems in relation to customer needs and "make adjustments as appropriate."</p><p>UPS starred in headlines today, too, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxjpj7j754o">BBC</a> reports the company is looking to cut 30,000 jobs, as it moves away from Amazon. UPS claims deliveries for Amazon are "extraordinarily dilutive" to its overall profits. Instead, it's been reported that it could look to other, more profitable customers, such as healthcare companies.</p><h2 id="it-s-become-a-tiring-trend-2">It's become a tiring trend</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2007px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="toNvbWnU2ksQjHdk3DpQGD" name="Amazon-logo-wide.jpg" alt="Amazon logo gray background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/toNvbWnU2ksQjHdk3DpQGD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2007" height="1128" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon has a lengthy history of harsh layoffs over the past few years. We have the 14,000 roles lost from October 2025, but we can walk things back to its largest cut in history: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-cutting-18000-jobs">18,000 roles in early 2023</a>. The company stated then that the majority of those impacted were involved in its Amazon Stores and People, Experience, and Technology organizations. Two months later that same year, Amazon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-additional-role-eliminations">let go of 9,000 people</a>, as its shedding continued.</p><p>Let's also not forget that Amazon let go of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/amazon-confirms-employee-layoffs">roughly 10,000 people</a> right around the holidays in 2022. Taking matters in a different direction, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/amazon-layoffs-job-cuts-tech-74387fae2313ff7b0b1e638c00863443">AP News</a> highlights a previous statement by Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy, who said the company will look to generative AI to "reduce its corporate workforce" in the future.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-2">Android Central's Take</h2><p>Bearing witness to layoffs in any capacity always leaves me with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. Take a look at today's climate, and you'll quickly know that people need work. People need their money for their livelihood, their family, their loved ones, etc. We should take Amazon's Beth Galetti's words and remember them. Statements such as these massive layoffs not being a regular occurrence are huge—especially in the tech space. Will we be in the same position we are right now come March? Come October, November?</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is regarding the rumors we've been hearing about a privacy display for its upcoming series.</p><p>Samsung states that, when out in public (or in other places), users can customize the level of privacy their display provides.</p><p>"Adjusting visibility" is the name of the game here. Samsung says users can protect certain parts of their display, such as their notifications. However, it highlights the privacy display's ability to hide your phone's unlock credentials, too. Samsung says it will prepare to introduce "privacy at a pixel level." The teasers indicate that people standing or sitting around you won't be able to pry from an angle.</p><p>Samsung ends this feature's teaser with a statement: "This is privacy you can see and security you can feel – and it’s coming to Galaxy very soon." The tail end of this is what's causing a lot of buzz, as this looks like its first official Galaxy S26 teaser.</p><h2 id="it-s-on-the-way-2">It's on the way</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:338px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.51%;"><img id="QXoBCvRM8WF4JmDQvW5exc" name="samsung-galaxy-s26-privacy-display-teaser" alt="Samsung officially teases its upcoming privacy display, which is likely headed for the Galaxy S26." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QXoBCvRM8WF4JmDQvW5exc.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="338" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been wrapped in Galaxy S26 rumors concerning this privacy display for a while now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-shows-first-look-at-built-in-privacy-display">with leaks spotting its settings</a>. The information was supposedly retrieved from Samsung's One UI 8.5 beta, showcasing options to adjust its intensity, as well as automatic triggers. These triggers would be based on your environment, which could allow your phone to automatically shut off certain parts of your display to potential prying eyes.</p><p>A tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-display-preview">recently posted photos on X</a> about how this could look in real life. Samsung's blog post states that it wanted to pair security capabilities on a hardware and software level, and if it all goes well, that could boost a user's privacy while outside by a noticeable amount.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-7">Android Central's Take</h2><p>Stepping up privacy on your phone is always a plus, and doing it in a way such as this only makes it better. While I have to temper my excitement for the moment, Samsung hasn't <em>exactly </em>said this is for the Galaxy S26, but it certainly looks that way. More than that, past rumors have only mentioned this for the S26 Ultra. I'm an Ultra guy, and if this is headed for that phone, it's going to be hard for me to ignore it. Rumors have said the next series could debut late in February, and if we're taking <em>hardware </em>privacy features to this kind of level, I'm glad.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google Chrome has long been a window to the internet, a reliable but fairly static tool for moving between tabs. Now, Google is rebuilding Chrome around Gemini and turning it from a simple gateway into a proactive assistant that works inside your browsing sessions.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> coming to Chrome, Google believes AI should no longer be limited to separate apps. Instead, the search giant wants it to sit next to your open tabs and help you think, decide, and act more quickly. Google says these updates are based on Gemini 3 and are rolling out to Windows, macOS, and Chromebook Plus users in the U.S.</p><p>A redesigned side panel is at the heart of this change. This means you no longer have to switch between tabs or opening new windows, as Gemini now stays on the side of your screen. You can keep working on a report, comparing products, or checking emails in one tab, while asking Gemini to summarize reviews, compare prices, or organize your schedule in another.</p><p>Google says testers have used Gemini to manage busy calendars, browse several shopping sites, and organize information scattered across many open pages.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3224px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.09%;"><img id="PNkjhN6LUJt74Nh9GdqdqT" name="Gemini-in-Chrome-Side-Panel" alt="Gemini side panel in Chrome for desktop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PNkjhN6LUJt74Nh9GdqdqT.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3224" height="2292" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="native-creative-tools-2">Native creative tools</h2><p>The company is also focusing on creativity with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/tech-talk-what-the-heck-is-gemini-nano-banana">Nano Banana</a>. Instead of downloading images, editing them in another app, and uploading them again, you can now change visuals inside Chrome. Just type your request in the side panel, and Gemini takes care of it.</p><p>Connected Apps make things more useful. Gemini in Chrome connects with services like Gmail, Calendar, YouTube, Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights. This lets it pull details from your inbox, check travel options, and draft messages all in one place. For example, planning a conference trip can become a single conversation: Gemini finds your event email, checks flights, suggests options, and helps you notify coworkers. These integrations are found in Gemini’s settings, and users need to opt in to use them.</p><p>Soon, Google plans to add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/get-personal-geminis-personal-intelligence-uses-your-google-apps-for-answers-that-matter">Personal Intelligence</a> to Chrome. This feature will let Gemini remember context from past conversations and follow custom instructions, so its responses become more personalized over time. Google describes this as changing Chrome from a “general-purpose tool” to a personalized assistant that understands your habits and preferences. Google also says users stay in control, with the option to connect or disconnect apps at any time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="29yRpjmXCEKFKzhBqvdzY" name="Gmail-integration-Gemini" alt="Gemini integration in Gmail through a button in the top right" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/29yRpjmXCEKFKzhBqvdzY.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="android-central-s-take-12">Android Central's Take</h2><p>In my view, Gemini in Chrome is the kind of upgrade that power users have been waiting for. Having an AI assistant in the side panel, pulling context from my apps, and helping me manage too many tabs makes Chrome feel more mature. It saves time, reduces mental clutter, and makes browsing feel more focused instead of chaotic.</p><p>That said, I’m not pretending this is all sunshine and productivity boosts. Google now learns even more about how I work, what I search for, and how I plan my life, and that feels a bit uncomfortable, no matter how many “you’re in control” buttons they add. So, while Gemini in Chrome is genuinely useful and could change how we get things done online, it comes with the usual Google trade-off: great convenience in exchange for trusting a massive company with even more of your digital footprint.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-in-chrome-browsing-with-ai-assisted-answers-security-more-announced">began adding Gemini to Chrome</a> in the second half of last year, allowing users to ask questions about a page and consolidate information across multiple pages. With this new update, however, Google is going a step further by letting Gemini handle complex, multi-step workflows through a new auto browse feature.</p><p>We can already use Chrome to autofill credit cards and other information with a single click, but Google says it is now "advancing beyond simple tasks" to enable agentic actions. With auto browse, Gemini can take over multi-step chores and complete them for you.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/chrome/gemini-3-auto-browse-personal-intelligence/">According to Google</a>, auto browse can handle many mundane tasks. For example, if you are planning a trip, you can search for hotels and flights across different dates to find options that fit your budget and schedule.</p><h2 id="chrome-now-wants-to-handle-the-boring-web-tasks-for-you-2">Chrome now wants to handle the boring web tasks for you</h2><div class="jwplayer__widthsetter">    <div class="jwplayer__wrapper">        <div id="futr_botr_7qwq2j4s_ompFMCqB_div"            class="future__jwplayer"            data-player-id="ompFMCqB"            data-playlist-id="7qwq2j4s">            <div id="botr_7qwq2j4s_ompFMCqB_div"></div>        </div>    </div></div><p>Similarly, it can help with scheduling appointments, filling out tedious online forms, getting quotes from electricians or plumbers, and even filing expense reports, effectively handling the manual work you would normally do yourself.</p><p>Google says auto browse can also handle more complex tasks. For instance, if you are planning a Y2K-inspired party and have an image for reference, you can ask Gemini to analyze what is in the picture, find similar items, and add them to your cart.</p><div class="jwplayer__widthsetter">    <div class="jwplayer__wrapper">        <div id="futr_botr_G6ZZ3dmJ_ompFMCqB_div"            class="future__jwplayer"            data-player-id="ompFMCqB"            data-playlist-id="G6ZZ3dmJ">            <div id="botr_G6ZZ3dmJ_ompFMCqB_div"></div>        </div>    </div></div><p>If you grant permission to work with Password Manager, auto browse can even sign in to websites and complete actions for you.

We will share updates as the feature expands to more regions.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-17">Android Central's Take</h2><p>To be honest, I have never really cared about Gemini's integration into  Chrome until now. Most of the tasks it handled previously could just as easily be done by visiting the Gemini website directly, which I often did anyway.</p><p>Auto browse is the first time Gemini feels genuinely useful inside Chrome. I hate filling out forms or signing into websites every day, and if Gemini can offload even those simple tasks for me, it could end up being well worth it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the phone is incredibly generic looking, something about it is very special: the display.</p><p>That's because it's the first phone on the market to use the upgraded Samsung M14 LEAD OLED panel. It's an upgrade on the display panel used in the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> and all four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17</a> models, and while it promises all the usual upgrades Samsung tends to deliver — higher peak brightness, faster refresh rates, better color accuracy, etc — it's also got a few surprises we expect to see when the panel makes its way to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 family</a>.</p><p>But Samsung isn't going to just slap the same display on its next flagship phone and call it a day. The company is known for using different displays on its own flagships, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-display-review">for better or worse</a>, and this time around is likely going to be no different. Since Samsung hasn't officially announced the Galaxy S26's display yet, outside of a teaser, we'll need to base this on IQOO's presentation of the technology and how that might look on a Samsung phone.</p><h2 id="what-they-ll-get-right-2">What they'll get right</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U4tHFizrN2jBhUVvJ7RE6L" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-apple-iphone-17-pro-max-display-outside" alt="Comparing the displays of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max in the sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U4tHFizrN2jBhUVvJ7RE6L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the past two years, Samsung has excelled in outdoor visibility. Some might attribute this to peak brightness, but the real secret lies in the company's use of anti-glare technology. The Galaxy S24 Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> are two of the <em>only</em> flagship phones to use this, and it cuts down on the reflections that normally require high brightness to overcome.</p><p>What's interesting is that Samsung is likely not only incorporating this feature again with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, but will also be using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/articles/coming-soon-galaxy-new-layer-of-privacy">a new Privacy Display</a> feature that blocks out sensitive information on your screen to people trying to peek over your shoulder. That means the screen may be able to control the direction of light emission and fully block portions of the screen from passersby who might be looking at it.</p><p>Privacy Display looks to be fully customizable, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/leak-about-the-galaxy-s26-ultras-display-says-youll-forget-screen-protectors-existed">leaks have shown</a> that you'll be able to granularly select on-screen elements to automatically hide, like images and text, or go full Monty and black out the screen entirely if you're not looking at it straight on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="5w79Vk8gTYXUoePAet8bK9" name="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-privacy-screen-notification-leak" alt="A leak showing the new Privacy Display feature blocking out a notification from an angle on a Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5w79Vk8gTYXUoePAet8bK9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @UniverseIce on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2016342843644883276?s=20">Leaks say</a> that Samsung's "Flex Magic Pixel" technology uses directional "gates" that can be controlled via software. When the phone's camera detects that someone nearby is looking at your phone, it positions these gates in a way that prevents the OLED from shining light in that direction, and is likely one of the reasons the company removed the display's polarizer layer entirely.</p><p>IQOO noted in its display presentation that the Samsung M14 LEAD OLED is also brighter due to the removal of this layer, reaching a peak brightness of 6,000 nits in HDR scenes. IQOO isn't utilizing the Flex Magic Pixel technology in its phone, so brightness of the S26 Ultra's panel may differ from the IQOO 15.</p><p>The M14 display on the IQOO 15 supports up to 144Hz, but it's unclear whether Samsung will support this on the Galaxy S26 series. It's also got a 1440×3168 resolution, which, on the IQOO 15's 6.85-inch display, equates to a razor-sharp 508 pixels per inch density. That's slightly higher than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is already one of the most pixel-dense smartphone displays. Samsung is also said to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultras-updated-design-could-make-it-the-most-comfortable-yet">further rounding the corners</a> of the display, making it more comfortable to hold.</p><h2 id="what-could-potentially-go-wrong-2">What could potentially go wrong</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rzqwwEeeEjnT9H2btEC7KV" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-7-good-lock-lockstar" alt="Customizing the lock screen using Good Lock's LockStar module on One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzqwwEeeEjnT9H2btEC7KV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For years, people like myself have complained about Samsung's use of low-frequency <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> at all brightness levels, which can cause headaches, eye pain, and other debilitating health issues. From what I can tell, IQOO has made several modifications to this display tech to ensure this doesn't happen on its phone.</p><p>But I'm still not convinced that Samsung will follow suit on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. I've seen <em>one</em> rumor suggesting Samsung will use a higher PWM rate this time around, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-epilepsy-3599543/" target="_blank">based on leaked code</a>, but this feature seems to apply only to videos flickering at 15-30Hz, which can trigger photosensitive epilepsy.</p><p>The screen will reportedly dim during these moments, but since Samsung screens using PWM dimming don't <em>actually dim</em> when they reduce perceived brightness, that point seems a bit moot.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7YERgEja5qZJvnJ5AwMPBL" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-apple-iphone-17-pro-max-display-flicker-rate" alt="A look at the flicker rate of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max displays" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7YERgEja5qZJvnJ5AwMPBL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's displays currently operate at a 480Hz dimming rate, a number that far exceeds the photosensitive epilepsy danger zone, but doesn't come close to meeting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">industry standards for flicker safety</a>. IQOO's implementation of 2160Hz would fix that problem for <em>most</em> users, but again, there's no guarantee Samsung will implement that number.</p><p>Meanwhile, rivals like Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-pro-display-review">have pushed this number</a> to 4,230Hz and beyond, ensuring even the most flicker-sensitive users have a chance to use a modern smartphone without enduring pain. Specs like PWM frequency aren't like other specs, as people who are flicker-sensitive <em>cannot physically use</em> phones with low rates, meaning this isn't just some silly complaint about performance.</p><p>Samsung has fallen significantly behind rivals in the eye care category, often prioritizing high scores in artificial benchmarks over user complaints. Apple launched a new PWM-sensitive feature with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17</a> series, and while Apple's method doesn't solve the problem for all flicker-sensitive users, it goes a long way toward acknowledging the problem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3944px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UfAZVXgUvb9MFoJh2pU3J6" name="pwm-explainer-with-graphs-fall-2025" alt="Showing what the flicker rate of PWM dimming and three alternatives look like using graphs of a Google Pixel 10 Pro, TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra, Honor 400 Pro, and Honor Magic V5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UfAZVXgUvb9MFoJh2pU3J6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3944" height="2218" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're also not sure if the Galaxy S26 family's M14 LEAD OLED will be a true 10-bit OLED panel, or if Samsung will continue to stick with 8-bit for cost-saving reasons.

The company hasn't historically acknowledged the flicker-sensitive community, despite the ubiquity of Samsung displays, and I haven't seen any real sign that it will suddenly start caring this year. I hope I'm wrong.</p><h2 id="more-of-the-same-for-better-or-worse-2">More of the same, for better or worse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rConETVQmGig7r2EF4Vz5L" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-display-color-mode" alt="Changing the display color mode on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rConETVQmGig7r2EF4Vz5L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What I'm seeing so far is a Samsung that is doubling down on what it does well: delivering a sharp, clean-looking display that's easy to see outside even in broad daylight. The company is reportedly adding a new privacy layer to the display, and that could give it a unique advantage over rivals who regularly trounce Samsung in areas like eye care technology and peak brightness.</p><p>Famed leaker Ice Universe is looking at things <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1995658414110941670?s=20" target="_blank">through a cynical lens</a>, saying Samsung will almost certainly hold the M14 LEAD OLED back from greatness by limiting its brightness, dropping the PWM frequency substantially, sticking to an 8-bit display, and making other cuts to save on power and costs.</p><p>Considering Samsung's market position, I'd hope this wouldn't be the case, but time will tell whether the cynic is right. Either way, I'm expecting <em>something</em> new and exciting from this display, and that's great for anyone looking to upgrade this year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, there are a few notable changes worth pointing out.</p><p>For starters, the status bar at the top appears slightly taller than what we currently see on ChromeOS devices. The recording shows the date and time on the left side of the bar, while the right side includes icons for Gemini, Android 16-style Wi-Fi and battery indicators, a screen recording icon, and an 'EN' language indicator, likely for the keyboard.</p><p>Similar to Android 16’s desktop mode, the start button sits near the center of the bottom bar. One notable change is the mouse cursor, which now features a small tail. As expected from a desktop OS, window controls for minimizing, maximizing, and closing appear on the right side of each window.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-22">Android Central's Take</h2><p>Overall, this appears to be our first accidental glimpse of Aluminium OS. There isn't much that stands out yet, but it does confirm that Google is actively working on the project and preparing to move toward a unified desktop platform.</p><p>It also makes me more eager for Android-powered PCs later this year. I'm curious to see whether they can truly replace my Mac, considering Aluminium OS can run Chrome fully, including extensions, as seen in the recording shared by the publication.</p><p>With multiple brands working with Google and Qualcomm on Android PCs for 2026, this leak suggests the platform is finally starting to take shape.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The post states that the Phone 4a Pro, marked as A069P, was spotted moving through the EU's EPREL listings for energy approval. This concerns its battery, which is where the tipster states we might only see minimal change.</p><p>According to the listing, the Phone 4a Pro may only feature a 5,080mAh battery. Looking back, the Phone 3a Pro, like the base 3a, offers a 5,000mAh battery. Consumers might only be in for a subtle 80mAh difference between the two generations.</p><p>The certification details continue, stating the Phone 4a Pro could also provide 50W wired charging and an IP65 rating. As GSMArena points out, those energy certification details have given the device a "C" in fall testing and a "C" in repairability. The tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZionsAnvin/status/2016070447851569597">added to their thread</a> today, stating that the Phone 4a Pro has supposedly passed through India's BIS certification, too.</p><h2 id="looking-forward-2">Looking forward</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Z9FJmhDhi7XDUUgHVX55e" name="nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-3a-pro-displays-05" alt="Comparing the displays and sizes between the Nothing Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z9FJmhDhi7XDUUgHVX55e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It looks like we're just getting started with Nothing's mid-range leaks, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-4a-mightve-just-shown-up-yet-all-i-want-is-meaningful-upgrades">yesterday, reports surfaced</a> about the base Phone 4a. Another overseas certification listing was discovered, placing the device at the forefront of our minds. While the listing didn't express any key details, it's at least (probably) indicative that a launch is on the way. Nothing debuted its 3a series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">around March last year</a>, and it looks like sentiments for this year remain the same.</p><p>Each model in the series sports a 5,000mAh battery with 50W charging. So, while we're seemingly not in for much change here, the 3a series does sport an IP64 rating. In that, it looks like Nothing is trying to up its resistances by a touch.</p><p>The price of this next series is still up in the air; however, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothings-ceo-says-smartphones-are-about-to-get-more-expensive">has confirmed</a> that its products might rise in that regard. The company attributes this to the rise in DRAM and NAND costs.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-27">Android Central's Take</h2><p>I'm more interested in what else Nothing can bring to its mid-range series. Such devices are a little more consumer-friendly due to their slightly lower price point. At the same time, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">Phone 3a Pro was a stellar device</a>, as pointed out by Android Central's Harish Jonnalagadda. The device's <em>hardware </em>was what stood out the most, and I don't think I'm worried that Nothing can deliver on that front. It's just, when you look at others, like Motorola with the Edge 2025 and its 5,200mAh battery (68W) charging, you want some more urgency.</p> ]]></dc:content>

What the tipster suggests is that Google Wallet will bring an update to change its home screen from the otherwise outdated design we have currently. A "grid-style" UI is reportedly on the way, which will show four of a user's "favorite" cards or passes.</p><p>This term "favorites" is what's important here. AssembleDebug says that users will have a chance to "favorite" or "star" passes/cards they'd like to remain on their home screen. It should give users ease of use in the long run. However, the post adds that Google Wallet will supposedly choose your four favorites right off the bat.</p><p>Users can, of course, go through and decide for themselves which are their true favorites. The passes and cards are quite colorful, taking on whatever the primary hue is for the digital item, as well as rounded corners, which has become common across Android's aesthetic.</p><p>On the other side, the tipster spotted a "View More" button. Google's early code reads, "Tap View more to manage what's on home, search your wallet, and see all your payment methods, passes, and activity." There's no clear indication as to when this Wallet rework could arrive for users.</p><h2 id="making-it-easy-2">Making it easy</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="UTDojKneVW5L5v9ApjCbai" name="google-wallet-grid-style-home-rumor" alt="Google Wallet is rumored to rework its home screen with a grid view that shows four favorite passes/cards." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTDojKneVW5L5v9ApjCbai.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="oXn7tJoWUCzKpsiMEvnvZi" name="google-wallet-grid-style-view-more" alt="Google Wallet's rumored "View more" could deliver a more expansive grid view for your saved passes and cards." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXn7tJoWUCzKpsiMEvnvZi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google Wallet's been trying to refine its experience, as, since it's digital, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallets-new-feature-saves-android-users-from-fumbling-for-passes">users don't want to fumble around with it</a>. An update around the holidays brought a feature that pushes Wallet to produce the appropriate pass or card based on your location. If you've got a train pass and you've arrived at the station, Wallet would bring it up for you. If you're at a grocery store, you can expect to see your debit or credit card. This "context-aware" feature was something Google teased during I/O last year.</p><p>On a related note, Google's also working on providing mobile users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-on-android-looks-to-be-that-one-stop-shop-for-your-purchase-history">with their entire purchase history</a> in Wallet. This isn't entirely new, as Wallet's web version does this. It's just Android that's feeling left out. This purchase history would display your card's activity across every device that has access to it.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-32">Android Central's Take</h2><p>I'm glad to see Google move in this direction for Wallet. Not only is it colorful, which is a plus on its own, but it's functional. Right now, Google Wallet feels a little stale and barebones. Sure, there's card present at the top, but I hardly ever look at anything beneath it. I can get my coupon information in other ways. This feature, should it roll out as rumors say it may, might make Wallet feel a little more appealing to use. Plus, it'll be fast to open it, tap a card or pass, and get moving.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With the S26 Ultra, those transitions should look flawless.</p><p>You’re also getting a 6.9-inch screen that’s reportedly flatter than ever, making it a dream for S Pen users who hate it when the nib slips off the edge.</p><p>You can expect this billion-color phone to launch with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 in late February 2026.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-37">Android Central's Take</h2><p>I’ve been tracking Samsung’s display evolution for years, and frankly, seeing them finally ditch the 8-bit software hacks feels like a long-overdue victory. For me, this is more than just a line item on a spec sheet; it’s the end of having to look at a high-res photo or an HDR movie and see those distracting color bands in the shadows. I think people will notice the extra depth and realism, especially if they use their phone as a main camera or for watching movies.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome plans start at $70/month and $80/month for a single line, respectively (with AutoPay), but you can drop that price down considerably by adding multiple lines. Bringing four users, for example, will drop the Unlimited Plus plan down to $40/month for each line.</p><p>Both plans give you unlimited talk, text, and 5G Ultra Wideband data on Verizon's vast network, plus you get a mobile hotspot, three-year price guarantee, and the ability to mix and match additional perks for as little as $10 each.</p><p>If Verizon's plans are still too expensive for you, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/hey-you-drop-your-phone-bill-to-50-bucks-or-less-with-my-top-5-favorite-wireless-deals-of-the-week">other carrier deals</a> that are worth checking out, but if you can make it work for you, this Pixel 10 Pro deal is an unmissable opportunity for camera pros and novices alike.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The update is two-pronged. Google states it's rolling out a change to make the "transition to a conversation even more seamless." This is more of a QoL (quality of life) update than anything else, as Google says users can hop into follow-up questions much faster in AI Overviews.</p><p>As users receive the update, you can pose your initial query as normal. However, scrolling down to the text box once again and asking another question tosses users into a "back and forth" with AI Mode, as Google puts it. The follow-up questions will continue to retain the original conversation's context, alongside relevant links and more.</p><p>The other side of this update (and, arguably, what's carrying everything) is Gemini 3.</p><p>Google announces that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">Gemini 3</a> has now been moved into the default AI model behind everything AI Mode accomplishes for users. The post states Gemini 3 is available globally for users in Search/AI Overviews for queries and follow-up questions.</p><h2 id="gemini-3-2">Gemini 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jPNmASUaZBcNT8RFCxw67R" name="google-io-ai-overviews" alt="AI overview stats at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jPNmASUaZBcNT8RFCxw67R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini 3 was announced in November and positioned as Google's most powerful AI model to date. Shortly after, the company made another announcement, stating the AI was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-expands-gemini-3-and-nano-banana-pro-availability-for-ai-mode-in-search">headed to AI Mode in Search globally</a>. The key takeaway from this is that Google first brought Gemini 3 to users who were AI Pro or AI Ultra subscribers. Those users, when engaged with AI Mode's complete view, could hit the drop-down menu and switch its thinking to Gemini 3.</p><p>Google announced that Gemini 3 in "AI Mode can grasp the nuance of your most complex queries." Now that the model has moved into a default position within AI Overviews and is available to users globally, it might get a ton more mileage. Gemini 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-is-now-powered-by-gemini-3">also arrived in NotebookLM</a> late last month, too.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-47">Android Central's Take</h2><p>Considering how you're speaking to a computer, understanding the "nuance" in a user's query is incredibly important. I personally don't want to see a time where you're asking about local events or pop-up events in a city and AI Overview's giving me tents for an outdoor trip (not that it's ever happened before). Google bringing Gemini 3 into AI Overviews as a default model makes sense. Subscribers and those who want to go the distance can grab its Pro model if required. Moving the base model into a spot where the average person can reach it is always a plus in my book.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google bolstered its subscription offerings for the AI era, adding plans now known as Google AI Pro and  AI Ultra to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> suite. In some regions, a mid-tier Google AI Plus plan offered basic artificial intelligence features and other perks at a much lower price than the Pro or Ultra plans. Now, Google is bringing AI Plus to 35 more countries and territories, including the U.S., the company announced Tuesday, Jan. 27.</p><p>Google AI Plus is now available for $7.99 per month in the U.S., bridging the gap between free Google accounts and the pricier AI Pro and AI Ultra tiers. For a limited time, users can save 50% for their first two months of AI Plus, sweetening the deal. Like many of Google's other subscription offerings, customers can share AI Plus benefits with up to five family members.</p><p>Aside from AI features, the Google AI Plus subscription offers 200GB of total cloud storage. That's double the amount offered by the Google One Basic plan, costing $1.99 per month, and considerably less offered by the One Premium 2TB plan, which goes for $9.99 monthly. The appeal of the Google AI Plus plan is certainly the AI-focused perks, not the cloud storage benefit — though the latter definitely helps.</p><p>Specifically, AI Plus subscribers will get enhanced access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">Gemini 3 Pro</a>, Deep Research, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/tech-talk-what-the-heck-is-gemini-nano-banana">Nano Banana Pro</a>. While these tools are available on the free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> tier as well, they are rate-limited. The plan also offers access to Google's Veo 3.1 Fast video-generation model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:121.65%;"><img id="SfxsNgJUnBPoLe2rXJSY8Q" name="GoogleAIPlus_US" alt="The Google AI Plus subscription plan that is coming to the U.S." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SfxsNgJUnBPoLe2rXJSY8Q.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3160" height="3844" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other improvements include double the amount of monthly AI credits (200), wider access to Google's AI filmmaking tool Flow, and premium NotebookLM features like Audio Overviews. Google AI Plus grants access to Gemini in Workspace apps and Gemini in Chrome, the latter of which is debuting in early access as a personal assistant for browsing.</p><p>Since this is firmly a midpoint offering, it's not surprising that Google AI Pro and AI Ultra offer considerably more than Google AI Plus. Google AI Pro costs $19.99 per month and provides higher rate limits than AI Plus while expanding feature availability. Subscribers to the AI Pro plan can use Gemini Code Assist, Gemini CLI, and Jules more often. Google AI Pro users can also use more NotebookLM tools, expanded access to Gemini 3 Pro in Google Search, and 1,000 monthly AI credits.</p><p>For users deep in the Google ecosystem, a perk of Google AI Pro that might tip the scales is Google Home Premium Standard. This plan is the successor to Nest Aware, and it starts at $10 per month on its own. By subscribing to Google AI Pro for $20 per month, you'll get the benefits of One Premium 2TB ($9.99/mo.) and Google Home Premium Standard ($10/mo.) — plus a ton of AI extras — for the same price as paying for them separately.</p><p>Google AI Pro is thus the most appealing option for Google Home users with a bunch of smart speakers, smart displays, and Nest products.</p><p>But for everyone else? The best value Google subscription isn't AI Plus <em>or</em> AI Pro.</p><h2 id="the-best-value-google-subscription-is-actually-one-premium-2tb-2">The best-value Google subscription is actually One Premium 2TB</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SSu6vKywDUF5B9HAtLzJ9Y" name="Google-One-plans" alt="A Pixel 9a sitting on a blanket showing Google One Basic, Premium, and AI Pro plan options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSu6vKywDUF5B9HAtLzJ9Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A crucial detail in Google's announcement reveals that the best subscription deal inside this new lineup is actually Google One Premium 2TB.</p><p>Before today, Google One Premium 2TB cost $9.99 per month and offered 2TB of cloud storage (as the name suggests). This could be shared with up to five other family members. The service tacked on a couple of perks, like premium calling features in Google Meet and enhanced appointment scheduling in Google Calendar. However, One Premium 2TB missed out on extra AI features, including Gemini in Workspace.</p><p>No longer. Starting this week, the Google One Premium 2TB plan will include all the benefits of the new Google AI Plus subscription tier. If you're a current One Premium subscriber, your plan will be upgraded to include the AI tools in the chart above "in the next few days."</p><p>For new subscribers, the value proposition is enticing. For just $2 more per month than AI Plus, you can subscribe to One Premium and get a massive 2TB of cloud storage space that can be shared with the family. Never run out email, photos, or document storage again. It's a major upgrade compared to the 200GB cloud storage that comes with AI Plus.</p><p>I subscribe to AI Pro for the Google Home Premium benefits, but if I didn't need those, I'd be paying for Google One Premium 2TB. This longtime subscription plan stole the show. Google AI Plus is the shiny new offering, but One Premium 2TB is the sneaky value option.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thieves can get into your entire digital life, and Google is finally taking this seriously. Today, the company announced a big security update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> and newer that makes your phone much harder for criminals to access.</p><p>Google is taking a new approach here. Android now focuses on prevention, resistance, and recovery simultaneously rather than only reacting after a theft. More importantly, these upgrades improve authentication, biometrics, remote controls, and even regional settings.</p><p>The lock screen is still your first line of defense. On Android 16 and newer, Google is making it stronger by adding more authentication options. The Failed Authentication Lock, which started in Android 15, now has its own on/off switch in Settings. This gives you more control over how strict your phone is when someone keeps guessing your PIN.</p><p>Google is also making brute-force guessing less effective. If there are several failed attempts, the phone will increase the lockout time, which slows down attackers. At the same time, Android won’t lock you out for repeating the same mistake, like if a child keeps tapping the same wrong pattern, so you’re less likely to get locked out by accident.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:575px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:151.30%;"><img id="3QY69XEDcnMWzrfKVnHk5R" name="Android Theft Protection features_small" alt="Failed authentication lock feature description in settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3QY69XEDcnMWzrfKVnHk5R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="575" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="biometrics-are-now-your-universal-key-2">Biometrics are now your universal key</h2><p>Identity Check has become one of Android’s key security tools in 2025. It used to be limited to certain actions, but now it works with all apps and features that use the Android Biometric Prompt. This means that banking apps, password managers, and other sensitive tools now require biometric verification when you’re not in a trusted location.</p><p>For recovery, Google is improving Remote Lock, found at android.com/lock. You can already lock a lost phone from any browser, but now Google is adding an optional security question or challenge before the lock happens. This extra step helps make sure only the real owner can use it.</p><p>These recovery tools are now available on devices running Android 10 or newer, which includes most active phones around the world. This is especially important in places where people keep their phones for a long time.</p><p>Brazil is seeing some of the most interesting changes. New Android devices there now come with two major protections turned on automatically: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">Theft Detection Lock</a> and Remote Lock. Theft Detection Lock uses on-device AI to spot “snatch-and-run” situations and locks the screen right away if something seems wrong. Remote Lock also works even if you never set it up before. Your phone is protected from the start.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-52">Android Central's Take</h2><p>I really like where this is going. Having seen how quickly a stolen phone can cause financial trouble, I think these updates are practical, not just impressive in theory. It’s good to see Android treating theft as a system-wide issue rather than just adding a single feature. Identity Check alone is a big improvement, and when you add smarter lockouts and easier recovery, users get real peace of mind.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Purchase also comes with an 18-month warranty.</p><p>Anker says the device is super sturdy, having been drop-tested for up to 3.2 feet. The company also points to its scratch resistance, as assisted by the textured housing. As part of the current deal, Amazon is also offering two of the units for a slightly larger discount, if you have a need for two. This particular deal is also available in either black or white.</p><p>To be sure, the PowerCore 10K normally sells for $26, which we considered a little on the expensive side at the time of release. With 23% off it comes down to just $20, which may make it feel like a little bit more of a justifiable purchase for those who are apprehensive.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The upcoming iPhone Fold is rumored to be wider than current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, offering a more book-like experience when unfolded.</p><p>Some earlier reports suggested that Samsung was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-preparing-wide-screen-foldable">planning to launch a new Wide Fold</a> in response to the iPhone Fold. This device would sit alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-galaxy-z-flip-8-leak-predictable-camera-setup-with-potential-sensor-upgrades">Galaxy Z Flip 8</a>, and a new report now claims that Samsung has finalized its production targets for this wider foldable.</p><p>According to the Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20260127000230">ET News</a>, Samsung plans to produce one million Wide Fold units in 2026. This is significantly higher than the numbers typically allocated to Samsung's special-edition foldables, suggesting the company may be planning a much broader release for this device.</p><h2 id="samsung-sets-its-wide-fold-plans-before-iphone-fold-lands-2">Samsung sets its Wide Fold plans before iPhone Fold lands</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4527" height="2546" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While exact launch markets remain unknown, producing this many units suggests it could see a fairly global rollout. As for specs, the report claims the Samsung Wide Fold will feature a 7.6-inch 4:3 inner display and a 5.4-inch outer screen. That would make it noticeably wider than the current Galaxy Z Fold 7 and potentially better suited for watching videos.</p><p>That said, all of this remains subject to change. We are still early in Samsung's 2026 foldable cycle, especially considering the Galaxy S26 series itself is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-launch-date-reliable-leaker-confirms">still about a month away</a>.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-57">Android Central's Take</h2><p>Samsung once again appears to be getting ahead of itself by trying to preempt the iPhone Fold.

Both devices reportedly struggled with sales, and the Galaxy S26 Edge was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">eventually cancelled</a>.</p><p>Samsung now seems to be repeating that approach with the Wide Fold, attempting to launch it before fully understanding how the market will respond, seemingly in an effort to capture some of the hype around a wider foldable phone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-67">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Samsung is launching the Galaxy Z TriFold in the U.S. on January 30 for $2,899.</li><li>At $2,899, it’s one of the most expensive mainstream phones ever, sold only in Crafted Black with 512GB storage.</li><li>You get flagship-grade hardware: Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, a 200MP camera, the biggest battery yet in a foldable, and a super-thin 3.9mm profile when open.</li></ul><p>For the past few years, foldable phones have mostly come in two styles: book-style and clamshell. But Samsung has decided it’s time to break the mold. After years of perfecting these designs, the company has taken a bold step with a triple-folding smartphone that opens up to a tablet-sized screen. This new device, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, will launch in the U.S. on January 30, 2026.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold is Samsung’s clearest signal yet that it wants to redefine what a phone can be in 2026. Unlike the Galaxy Z Fold, which opens once, this phone unfolds twice to reveal a 10-inch screen that feels more like a small tablet than a regular phone.</p><p>If you’ve been watching Samsung’s progress with foldables, this step is logical. The company has spent several years working on better hinges, stronger displays, and smoother software. The TriFold is the result of that effort. It features a titanium hinge and a reinforced display coating to handle shocks. According to Samsung, the main screen can survive up to 200,000 folds, which is about 100 times a day for five years.</p><p>And yes, nearly three grand is the starting point. The Galaxy Z TriFold launches in the U.S. at $2,899, with 512GB of storage and a single Crafted Black color option. It’ll be sold through Samsung.com and Samsung Experience Stores, where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/hands-on-galaxy-z-trifold-us-stores">demo units are already available</a>.</p><h2 id="luxury-pricing-flagship-power-2">Luxury pricing, flagship power</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EipNTDQnPjdPmuxxLnxcxa" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EipNTDQnPjdPmuxxLnxcxa.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LqoQjyE2mm7LNgH7AUajMb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LqoQjyE2mm7LNgH7AUajMb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Jcj9BCzMwizR8o83SBasKb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jcj9BCzMwizR8o83SBasKb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YFWpn6fq226vinnkVAFZra" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFWpn6fq226vinnkVAFZra.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T2hV9GjZypdL7Kr3CL4yGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2hV9GjZypdL7Kr3CL4yGQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>So, what do you get for that price? Quite a bit. When unfolded, the phone is just 3.9mm thick at its thinnest point. It comes with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, a 200MP main camera, and what Samsung says is its biggest battery yet in a foldable phone.</p><p>Even more important, the large screen lets you take full advantage of all that power. You can edit photos, use several apps at once, or stream videos at full tablet size.</p><p>Samsung is also focusing on AI with this phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features are built into the interface, with tools like Photo Assist, Generative Edit, and Sketch to Image. Gemini Live offers real-time, conversational help that understands what you’re doing on the screen. Some basic AI features are free, but advanced and third-party tools might cost extra in the future.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-67">Android Central's Take</h2><p>From where I sit, the Galaxy Z TriFold is the most fascinating and riskiest phone Samsung has launched in years. It’s more than just a new device — it’s a statement. The big, multi-pane screen is perfect for multitasking and could even replace a small tablet for work on the go. The strong AI features, though still developing, aim to make complicated tasks easy. But the real question is whether people are ready to pay $2,900 for a phone, which is as much as a high-end laptop. This launch shifts the focus from simply making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> to asking what they can actually do. Samsung is betting that a triple-fold screen with smart AI is worth the price.</p><div style="min-height: 250px;">                                <div class="kwizly-quiz kwizly-OdBJQe"></div>                            </div>                            <script src="https://kwizly.com/embed/OdBJQe.js" async></script> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> unveiled a new feature called Personal Intelligence that aims to save you time by leveraging almost everything Google knows about you. It's opt-in, and users can tailor exactly which information Gemini can access from connections like Gmail and Google Photos. If you're a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscriber like me, you've probably been greeted with a "Supercharge Gemini with Personal Intelligence" pop-up over the last few weeks.</p><p>Personal Intelligence launched Jan. 14, and I've been asked to try Personal Intelligence a few times since then, with pop-ups appearing in the Gemini app on different devices. If you get a similar one, you'll need to make a choice: hit <strong>Not now</strong> to save Personal Intelligence for later, or press <strong>Get Started</strong> to dive in. You can always change your choice at any time, but should the average user try out Personal Intelligence or steer clear of it?</p><p>For now, I've made my choice — I'm keeping <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/get-personal-geminis-personal-intelligence-uses-your-google-apps-for-answers-that-matter">Personal Intelligence</a> turned off. Or, at least, I thought I was. It turns out that Personal Intelligence is the evolution of Gemini's earlier Personal Context feature, and part of it is enabled by default. Here's everything you need to know about it, from the convenience benefits to the privacy situation.</p><h2 id="personal-intelligence-is-an-expanded-version-of-personal-context-2">Personal Intelligence is an expanded version of Personal Context</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WQz9myG7fMo5EUDGkCMQuK" name="Gemini-Personal-Context-2" alt="The Gemini Personal Intelligence feature on an Android phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQz9myG7fMo5EUDGkCMQuK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Personal Intelligence is a supercharged version of Personal Context, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-app-personal-context-uses-old-chats-future-personalized-answers-update">a similar Gemini feature added about six months ago</a>. Unlike the former, the latter is enabled by default, but users can opt out. Personal Context uses past Gemini chats to create a personalized experience for future ones. It can learn things about you based on what you've chatted about in the past, including your likes, dislikes, and preferences. This is based on your Gemini Apps Activity, which can be managed and deleted manually.</p><p>Personal Intelligence is now the catch-all brand for Gemini's personalization features, replacing Personal Context. The functionality and memory-based features formerly known as Personal Context are now identified as <strong>Past Gemini chats</strong>. This setting has its own toggle on the Personal Intelligence page, but it's enabled by default (like Personal Context) — even if you hit <strong>Not now</strong> for Personal Intelligence.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="BYQAovx24uAZVAkbQqshpN" name="google-gemini-personal-context-example" alt="Google's Gemini app picks up "personal context," a feature that lets the AI automatically pull important details about a person from past chats to use for future queries." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYQAovx24uAZVAkbQqshpN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the past, you could let Gemini learn from your prior chats and provide specific instructions for how it should respond in certain situation. Users could even add key facts for Gemini to remember in the Personal Context page; this functionality remains as <strong>Instructions for Gemini</strong> under Personal Intelligence today. The difference between the old and new Personal Intelligence features is that the latest ones personalize your experience <em>without</em> you needing to teach Gemini the information.</p><p>The new features are found under <strong>Connected Apps</strong> in the Personal Intelligence tab. By connecting Google apps to Gemini, "you can choose to have Gemini use insights about you from some Connected Apps to personalize your experience and help you get more done." For example, if you connect Gemini to Google Photos and ask for your license plate, it can scan your photo library to find the answer.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">works across Google Workspace apps</a>, including Gmail and Drive, and others like Photos, Home, Search, and YouTube. There are toggles for each one, so you can choose exactly which data sources feed into Personal Intelligence. Google notes that only your prompts — not your personal info found in connected apps — are used for training AI models.</p><h2 id="i-m-leaving-gemini-personal-context-on-but-keeping-personal-intelligence-off-2">I'm leaving Gemini Personal Context on, but keeping Personal Intelligence off</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WgvMUEtiWjgH7Rio2m2Kub" name="Gemini-3-1" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WgvMUEtiWjgH7Rio2m2Kub.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although it's easy to be wary of giving AI more of your information, Google makes a compelling case in its Personal Intelligence <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/personal-intelligence/" target="_blank">blog post</a> for turning it on:</p><div><blockquote><p>We built Personal Intelligence with privacy at the center. Connecting your apps is off by default: you choose to turn it on, decide exactly which apps to connect, and can turn it off anytime. When enabled, Gemini accesses your data to answer your specific requests and to do things for you. And because this data already lives at Google securely, you don't have to send sensitive data elsewhere to start personalizing your experience. </p><p>Google</p></blockquote></div><p>I'll paraphrase Google's explanation liberally here: it's essentially saying that you already trust the company to store your personal information, so letting Gemini tap into your connected apps adds no further privacy risks. It's not a bad argument, because companies like Google already know almost everything about you and me. Most of us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-you-should-care-about-what-companies-are-doing-with-your-clicks">surrender our precious data to tech companies willingly</a>, so we might as well make it actually work for us, right?</p><p>I can see the logic there. When you're trusting a company like Apple, Google, or Meta with almost all of your personal info, disabling a certain feature can feel like an arbitrary line to draw. Personally, I'm drawing my arbitrary line here, by declining to connect Google apps to Gemini with Personal Intelligence.</p><p>The reason why I won't use Personal Intelligence isn't because I don't trust Google; in fact, I trust Google services with my most sensitive data. Instead, I'd rather keep using Personal Context and Instructions for Gemini as I have been for months. With these tools, I can selectively provide information to Gemini when it's relevant, and avoid unnecessary data sharing when it isn't.</p><p>In other words, I don't find the idea of Personal Intelligence all that useful. I already told Gemini key facts about my life, like my girlfriend's name and phone number, using Personal Context. When I need to ask questions about a document, I'll upload it to Gemini, or better yet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drives-new-ai-audio-summaries-make-pdfs-effortless">use the Gemini sidebar in Google Drive</a>. If I need to know my license plate number, I'll simply <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-google-photos-faster-response-times-rollout">use the Ask Photos tool in the Google Photos app</a>.</p><p>The minor benefit of having all these features under one umbrella <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-gets-personal-intelligence-about-your-gmail-photos-for-all-kinds-of-queries">in the Gemini app or AI Mode in Search</a> isn't enough for me to give the chatbot access to <em>everything</em>. At the end of the day, it's a call for each and every one of us to make ourselves. Only you can decide whether the convenience outweighs potential privacy concerns.</p><p>For me, I'm (mostly) keeping Personal Intelligence off, continuing to only use the features that have been around for months.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But what if you had to choose?

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> launched with a 6,000mAh battery, followed by the OnePlus 15 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">15R</a> with 7,300 and 7,400mAh, respectively. These phones can easily hit two days of use for most people, or over a day for power users</p><p>Then there are phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-lite-review">Honor Magic 8 Lite</a>, which takes things further with an 8,300mAh battery, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://event.realme.com/in/realme-p4-power-5g-new-launch">Realme P4 Power</a>, which has a 10,001mAh battery that it says can last for more than three days per charge.</p><p>Unfortunately, you won't find figures like this on Galaxy or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>, which generally don't even touch the 6,000mAh mark.

At least in the U.S., OnePlus has led the way to faster charging, with models reaching up to 100W, followed by Motorola, which usually hits up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-charging-speed">68W wired charging</a>. However, these speeds are much more commonplace outside the United States, where Chinese OEMs often hit over 100W wired charging on their flagship models and even some midrange.</p><p>This means you should be able to top up your phone in roughly half an hour or faster, depending on the phone, charging speed, and battery size.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung and Google are hitting up to 45W charging on their current flagships, which pales in comparison to their rivals. Thus, you'll have to wait a bit longer for a full charge; in many cases, an hour or more.</p><p>So, if you could have it your way, would you like more companies to focus on improving battery life or on faster charging speeds?

However, competing smart glasses brand Solos is now suing both Meta and EssilorLuxottica, alleging the two companies willfully violated multiple Solos patents.</p><p>Solos says these patents span "core technologies in the field of smart eyewear," including, but not limited to, integrated system architectures, multimodal sensing, beamforming, and audio processing. The company's court filing alleges that it "secured patent protection for these innovations years before [Meta and its co-defendants] began developing their smart-glasses programs." Notably, Solos is asking for damages "in the multiple billions of dollars" as a result of the alleged patent infringement.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed Friday, Jan. 23 in Massachusetts federal court. The filing claims Meta employees "studied Solos’ products, cited Solos’ patents, interacted with inventors, and gained insight into Solos’ engineering work" prior to making its own smart glasses available for purchase in 2021.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DvyS6hx86yeHSjVWgAzt6i" name="oakley-meta-hstn-meta-ai-app-garmin-workout-summary-01" alt="Oakley Meta HSTN AI glasses alongside the Meta AI app, containing a workout summary using data gathered from a Garmin smart watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DvyS6hx86yeHSjVWgAzt6i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Separately, Solos claims Oakley staffers saw Solos' technology in 2015. Around January 2019, a pair of Solos smart glasses was sent to an Oakley former senior executive at their request "for evaluation purposes." Over time, the Oakley executive "gained familiarity with Solos' integrated eyewear architecture and open-ear audio approach." The lawsuit lists Meta, the U.S. business of EssilorLuxottica, and its Oakley subsidiary.</p><p>Solos' patent infringement case specifically refers to the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer Gen 1 smart glasses. Additionally, since Meta's other smart glasses "derivative of the Gen 1 platform," the filing alleges "ongoing and continuous infringement. Finally, Solos is asking for a court injunction preventing further patent infringement, which could affect Meta smart glasses sales — if granted.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Meta and EssilorLuxottica for comment regarding the lawsuit (Solos Technology v. Meta Platforms, 26-cv-10304), but did not immediately hear back in time for publication. We will update this article if we receive a response. A spokesperson for Solos told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/meta-essilorluxottica-sued-over-smartglasses-technology-2026-01-23/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> the complaint "speaks for itself."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="unUqp4D26HQ57ZmhTJTiDh" name="solos-airgo-3-smart-glasses-white-wearing-01.jpg" alt="Wearing a white pair of Solos AirGo3 smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/unUqp4D26HQ57ZmhTJTiDh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Wearing a white pair of Solos AirGo3 smart glasses. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Solos' lineup of AirGo smart glasses feature open-air speakers, artificial intelligence powered by ChatGPT, live translation tools, and an optional camera. Unlike Meta's smart glasses offerings, Solos' are modular. The temples attach to the lens frame with USB-C connectors. In practice, this means users can upgrade the temples or swap out the frame style without needing to buy an entirely new pair of glasses.</p><p>This filing is the latest in a string of lawsuits surrounding smart glasses manufacturers. Earlier this month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/xreals-legal-battles-with-viture-head-to-us-shores">Xreal sued Viture in the U.S.</a>, following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-deals-blow-to-viture-with-patent-victory-and-german-sales-ban">a similar patent lawsuit in Germany a month prior</a>. Xreal says Viture's Pro XR glasses infringe on its patents, and is filing suit ahead of the expected XR glasses boom. The company's filing cited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-market" target="_blank">a research firm's claim</a> that the market will grow 6x in the decade. It could become a nearly $700 billion market by 2035.</p><p>Solos is making similar lofty claims about Meta's sales prospects in the coming years with its lawsuit. Solos says Meta smart glasses could generate $10 billion in revenue by 2030, based on current projections.</p><h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-smart-glasses-fans-2">What does this mean for smart glasses fans?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E6yCUezNGeLmwd6NVhfnL3" name="Ray-Ban-Gen-2-versus-Gen-1-with-case" alt="Photo of the Shiny Cosmic Blue Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses sitting on concrete in the foreground, with the black Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) Wayfarer sunglasses to their right and the official Ray-Ban charging case behind both sets of glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E6yCUezNGeLmwd6NVhfnL3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In an emerging market like wearables, patent disputes are not uncommon. Over the last few years, we've seen medical tech company Masimo sue Apple over over blood-oxygen monitoring on the Apple Watch, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman/ultrahuman-loses-delhi-high-court-dismissal-oura-lawsuit">smart ring company Ultrahuman sue competitor Oura</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/strava-drops-patent-suit-against-garmin-after-a-contentious-21-days">workout tracker Strava sue Garmin</a>.</p><p>Some of these disputes are solved very quickly with little consumer impact. Strava, for example, voluntarily dropped its suit against Garmin after a three-week spat. Others do affect the consumer market, like the Ultrahuman and Apple Watch sagas, which both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-wins-major-us-trade-case-against-smart-ring-rivals">included U.S. sales bans for certain products</a> — at least temporarily. Ultrahuman's smart rings currently cannot be sold in the U.S.</p><p>Solos is asking for a similar outcome — it is seeking an injunction that would prevent Meta from selling the allegedly infringing products. That doesn't mean the court will grant it, however. For now, Solos and Meta smart glasses will continue to be sold and operate as normal. This case will certainly have an impact on the future of the growing smart glasses market, as Solos is making strong claims about the current market leader's products.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In their experience, the user reports that the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth issues have vanished, though sideloading updates is a method not everyone is familiar with.</p><p>If you are comfortable sideloading OTA patches, users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota">can do so on Google's Developer site</a>. The user downloaded the EMEA variant, as they are from the U.K. For those in the U.S., they can simply use the 16.0.0 (BP4A.260105.004.E1, Jan 2026) version.</p><p>As always, if you're hesitant about sideloading, you can always wait until Google rolls out a patch on its own. There's no telling when that could happen, though. The good thing is that the company is aware of the issues plaguing its Pixels.</p><p>The original article can be read below.</p><p>January hasn't been kind to Google's Pixels, and it looks like that's going to continue, as new reports mark new issues.</p><p>Android Central received a tip about a series of reports from Pixel 10 users recently, all of which highlight struggles following the January update. There's a thread on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1qn80sf/major_errors_on_pixel_10_after_update/">Google Pixel subreddit</a> that breaks one user's experiences down quite well. The user states they've encountered "errors" on their Pixel 10 following an update this past week. This <em>could </em>be the January security patch, but nothing's certain.</p><p>The user states Bluetooth "no longer turns on," and they're struggling with Wi-Fi. Specifically, their report says, "'Internet' setting freezes in the settings app. It'll eventually load, but not able to successfully turn on wifi or show any networks to connect to."</p><p>Other issues include the "Search" function in settings no longer working as intended, their device is unable to charge off "lower power" methods, such as a USB port on their table, and their Pixel 10's battery seems to drain a little quicker. Another report from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/403411494?msgid=404363452">Pixel support community</a> highlights similar problems—but for a Pixel 8.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/404459360/wifi-and-bluetooth-refuse-to-start-on-pixel-10-pro?hl=en">user with a Pixel 10</a> attempted some troubleshooting: clearing cache, resetting connectivity, and booting in safe mode, but nothing has helped. While users struggle, hopefully, help is on the way, as one user highlights, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/403411494?msgid=404363452">Google is aware of the issue</a>.</p><h2 id="it-s-happening-again-2">It's happening... again</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="JvHZSo8pjw9StxB5jkVXmn" name="Google-Pixel-10-At-a-Glance" alt="The At a Glance widget on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvHZSo8pjw9StxB5jkVXmn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3410" height="1917" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From the timeline we've seen, it appears that Google's January security patch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-january-patch-rolls-out-huge-gpu-fixes-for-its-struggling-pixel-10-series">could be the culprit</a>. The patch arrived on January 13, and these patches usually take a little while to make their rounds and hit every device. The patch was (originally) seen in a bright light since it was finally delivering a much-needed GPU update for the Pixel 10.</p><p>However, days before that, users with two generations of Pixels (10 and 9) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/two-generations-of-google-pixel-flagships-seem-sluggish-after-update">were already reporting problems</a> after a Google Play Services update. Users claimed their devices were booting up slowly and that the Pixel Launcher was unresponsive at times.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-72">Android Central's Take</h2><p>It goes without saying that the user frustration that I've found on social media and on Google's forums makes sense. There's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-aod-display-flickering-issue-december-2025-update">a long history</a> here that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-promises-gpu-improvements-pixel-10">we can follow</a> together regarding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-arrival-soured-by-android-auto-unresponsive-issues-reports">the Pixel 10's struggles</a>, and Pixel struggles in general. At times, it feels like an otherwise well-made phone is watered down by the series of problems it often has. What's good here is that Google is, at least, aware of the problem. Now, users just have to wait for that fix to arrive. It's also not entirely clear how widespread these new problems are, but these reports are concerning enough.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, you can start a playlist on your phone and continue with the same queue on your tablet or in your browser. There’s no need to rebuild your lineup or guess where you left off.</p><p>For a long time, YouTube Music’s Now Playing queue was separate on each device. The Android and iOS apps kept their own lists, and web players sometimes pulled from mobile, but it didn’t always work. Switching devices usually meant starting with a new lineup and losing your groove.</p><h2 id="pick-up-where-you-left-off-2">Pick up where you left off</h2><p>That’s changing now. The service will sync your queue across all devices you’re signed into. When you open the app after using another device, you’ll see a label like “From your iPhone” or “From your browser” in the miniplayer until you press play. It’s a small touch, but it directly addresses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1jjq2it/why_doesnt_youtube_music_sync_listening_sessions/" target="_blank">common frustration for users</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:37.11%;"><img id="tqUD78sdBFPGFFrkssyWnR" name="YouTube-Music-queue-sync" alt="YouTube Music's Now Playing queue showing the "From your browser" label" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tqUD78sdBFPGFFrkssyWnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="475" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube Music prioritizes your most recent listening session, so your latest queue is the one you’ll see on other devices.</p><p>With queue syncing, YouTube Music now matches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">popular music streaming apps</a> like Spotify Connect, which has let users control music across phones, browsers, speakers, and more for a long time.</p><p>This update changes how you use the app. If you switch between devices — commuting with your phone, relaxing with a tablet, or working on the web — you finally get a listening experience that truly continues wherever you go.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-77">Android Central's Take</h2><p>In my opinion, this is the most important update YouTube Music has had in years. It’s one of those "finally" moments that makes the service feel like a premium product. The biggest benefit for me is how much easier it makes my day. I can switch from a workout playlist to a focus playlist without having to search for the right track, which is a huge improvement. If Google can keep this momentum up, it might finally convince the die-hard Spotify fans that the grass is actually greener — and more synchronized — over here.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster's report is light; however, that's likely on purpose (if true) because the Phone 4a has allegedly been certified overseas. Their post states the device appeared in the UAE's TDRA database.

That post alleged a Phone 4a and 4a Pro were on the way <em>and </em>that Nothing could stick with Qualcomm's more mid-range/affordable Snapdragon 7s series chips.

At the time, the company was hyping up its switch from MediaTek chips to Qualcomm, providing its devices with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a>. It was a budget chip that had been optimized to support stronger AI capabilities and even better performance. However, there were tests that placed the 3a lower than the 2a in gaming and graphical scenarios.</p><p>It remains to be seen what the Phone 4a and 4a Pro bring to the table, considering it could feature the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-4-announced">Snapdragon 7s Gen 4</a>. That chip really went all in on flagship-quality gaming features and support, so maybe the device can strive higher this year. Pricing is a concern, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothings-ceo-says-smartphones-are-about-to-get-more-expensive">Nothing confirmed</a> that phones will go up in 2026 due to rising DRAM and NAND costs.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-82">Android Central's Take</h2><p>It's going to be hard to keep me quiet about this one. Mid-range phones are an anomaly sometimes. Either they're really good and can perform well, or they leave much to be desired. Seeing as the Phone 3a, in benchmark tests, was placed lower than the 2a that came before it, hopefully, Nothing is looking to do better. I certainly hope so, considering consumers opting for mid-range don't necessarily have to settle with "lesser." More than that, not less than what came a year before.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, it wants you to see how it works under pressure. The tech giant is doubling down on its partnership with fitness platform iFIT, moving past basic app integration to a full television showcase.</p><p>Through this partnership, the Galaxy Watch Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> are featured in iFIT’s new endurance competition series, Trainer Games, now available on Prime Video. Last November, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-ifit-partnership-with-galaxy-watch-integration-and-six-month-demo">Samsung teamed up with iFIT</a> to offer Samsung Health users on-demand workouts led by professional trainers. Including its devices in a competitive TV show is the next step in that collaboration.</p><h2 id="real-world-stress-testing-2">Real-world stress testing</h2><p>In Trainer Games, participants face challenges that test their pacing, recovery, and durability. The twist is that they use the same retail products available to customers, specifically the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and Galaxy S25 Ultra, to track their performance.</p><p>Pairing a high-end wearable like the Galaxy Watch Ultra with the Samsung Health app offers more than just step counting. The system works as a digital coach. Viewers following the athletes on screen can access heart rate monitoring, detailed workout and recovery tracking, a running coach, an antioxidant index to measure intake, and bedtime guidance for better sleep.</p><p>The goal is to show that its Ultra branding means more than just marketing, and featuring the devices in an endurance-focused show might give Samsung a chance to prove they are tough enough for professionals and still easy for casual users.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-87">Android Central's Take</h2><p>I’ve watched many celebrity endorsements, but I prefer this stress-test style of marketing. Watching athletes use the Galaxy Watch Ultra in a tough setting like Trainer Games feels more genuine than a polished commercial. If you’ve been on the fence about whether the Ultra premium is worth it, seeing it survive these challenges might be the nudge you need. And I'm personally curious to see how that Antioxidant Index performs in a real-world training regimen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2026/01/25/android-17-blur/">9to5Google</a> suggests the update will introduce blur across more UI elements, replacing solid light and dark backgrounds with translucent layers that let content underneath subtly show through.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2732px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.14%;"><img id="uKEiXuxtfD2enREZLKV8AV" name="android-17-blur-ui" alt="Android 17's new blur UI look" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uKEiXuxtfD2enREZLKV8AV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2732" height="2162" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-17-blur-effects-images-3635155/">Android Authority</a> built on this with our first look at how the new UI might appear.

The company might even integrate this look to more of its first-party apps.</p><p>Of course, things could still change before Google officially unveils Android 17 later this year, but given that the design has already surfaced in leaks, it seems likely this direction will stick in some form.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-92">Android Central's Take</h2><p>Google adding more blur across Android 17 does not come as a surprise. Many Chinese smartphone makers like Xiaomi, Oppo, and Honor have already leaned heavily into iOS 26-style translucent UI effects, so it was only a matter of time before Google followed suit.</p><p>That said, it does feel a bit disappointing. Material 3 Expressive finally gave Android a look that felt distinct, and while this is still very much Material 3 at its core, it is hard to ignore that the UI now feels more borrowed than bold.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Over a dozen brands showcased new products at the event, and what stood out was just how much progress this category is making. Having used close to a dozen AR glasses over the last 12 months, it was exciting to see the likes of Even Realities G2 and Rokid's Meta-rivaling AI Glasses.</p><p>Then there's Appotronics. The Chinese brand will be familiar if you've used a laser projector in recent years, with its ALPD tech used in high-end models and cinemas. The brand is turning its attention to optical light engines for AR glasses, and showcased two new products: the Dragonfly G1 Mini, and Dragonfly C1.</p><p>The Dragonfly G1 Mini is interesting as it is significantly smaller than its predecessor, coming in at just 0.2cc. This allows AR device makers to roll out glasses that are thinner and lighter, with Appotronics touting glasses as light as 29g — half the weight of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Bans</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1706px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.03%;"><img id="7BK8NgnS43qL3tqttx4gKZ" name="Appotronics Dragonfly" alt="Appotronics Dragonfly G1 Mini optical light engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7BK8NgnS43qL3tqttx4gKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1706" height="1280" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Appotronics)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The engine is built on Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) tech, and the key benefit is that it delivers binocular imaging, so only one light engine is needed to power a pair of AR glasses. By contrast, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> uses a monocular light engine that's embedded in the right lens.</p><p>Another change is that the light engine is positioned in the center of the frame, and this again allows brands to deliver glasses with thinner overall designs or bigger batteries. I talked to Chen Menghao, General Manager of the Appotronics Innovation Center, and he indicated that the light engine is being used in Sharge's upcoming Loomos S1 glasses, which weigh just 29g.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="hLUeYDYizMdjoSQHVJqnQZ" name="Appotronics Dragonfly" alt="Appotronics Dragonfly G1 Mini optical light engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hLUeYDYizMdjoSQHVJqnQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Appotronics)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Dragonfly C1, meanwhile, is the first full-color dual-split LCoS design, and it delivers binocular AR display in full color via a single module. That in itself is a big deal, and Menghao talked about how demand for AR glasses is driving innovation into chromatic light engines. Whereas the G1 Mini uses a regular green LED, the C1 has RGB LEDs that enable full-color projection, unlocking a suite of new use cases.</p><p>While I'm yet to get my hands on the Meta Ray-Ban Display, I've been using Even Realities' G2 in the last two weeks, and I really like the fact that I can get notifications and relevant data without having to pull out my phone. The G2 uses a regular green projection, and I'm intrigued by how RGB lenses will make a difference in this area.</p><p>The key takeaway after talking to Menghao is how Appotronics is pioneering smaller optical light engines, and it's astonishing to see how much progress is being made in just a matter of months. That's always the case with a new category in general, and it's clear that AR glasses will see the kind of upgrades that we got with phone cameras over the last decade — I can't wait.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication claims that a Finnish retailer has published its Galaxy S26 series listing a little early, revealing something new: the base Galaxy S26 is updating its storage options. According to its discovery, the Galaxy S26 could chuck its minimal 128GB storage option.</p><p>The rumor doesn't allege that the device will settle with only one configuration. Two are still in the cards; however, the device may start at 256GB, and potentially a higher 512GB option.</p><p>Rumors add that the S26 Plus may remain similar (256GB, 512GB), as well as the Galaxy S26 Ultra with a 256GB, 512GB, and a 1TB option. This is where things get interesting, as other rumors suggested a similar possibility for the Galaxy S26. X tipster TheGalox_ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/2012393317258965294">also purported</a> a 256GB starting config for the model and a 512GB, but there's more: prices.</p><p>Since the storage has (supposedly) changed, the Galaxy S26 could start at $799. The Galaxy S26 Plus could begin at $999, while the S26 Ultra could start at $1,299.</p><h2 id="changes-are-rumored-but-not-really-2">Changes are rumored, but not really?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-titaniumsilverblue-s25plus-navy-s25-icyblue" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25, next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The storage sizes for the Galaxy S26 series have been relatively unknown. There was a rumor early last year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">that discussed the S26 Ultra</a>, which has been more or less reiterated in these alleged Finnish listings. A 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB option was rumored last March. So, in a way, you could say that it's "business as usual." Additionally, there <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AhmedQwaider888/status/2012722341457924528">was another rumor</a> about the Galaxy S26 series' battery capacities.</p><p>Tipster Ahmed Qwaider claims the Galaxy S26 could see a slight boost, rising to 4,300mAh with 25W charging. The S26 Plus could remain at 4,900mAh with 45W charging, and the S26 Ultra could see a 5,000mAh battery with 60W. The Ultra's rumored capacity has flip-flopped a little over the past year, so we'll have to see what happens during Samsung's launch.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-97">Android Central's Take</h2><p>If I'm honest—and considering what these leaks are really about—what's being talked about for the base model sounds intriguing. There's also the alleged starting price ($799), which lines up exactly where the model started out when the Galaxy S25 launched with 128GB. At face value, it seems consumers could get <em>more </em>storage for the same price. These are rumors, so I'm not jumping for joy just yet, but in a time where we're all concerned for rising prices, especially for our digital devices, this could be a good thing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In fact, Apple first made a name for itself in the consumer tech space with the iPod and iTunes, which were both compatible with Windows PCs in addition to Macs. Apple Music is following suit, as the music streaming service is now widely available on platforms like Android, Windows, Google TV, and ChromeOS. There's also a web app for Apple Music that can be accessed on virtually any device.</p><p>I've been a fan of Apple Music since it was called Beats Music before the Apple acquisition. Since then, the music streaming service continued to win me over, adding features like Dolby Atmos and lossless audio support while keeping prices low. I've acknowledged that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify">Spotify</a> and YouTube Music were better options for Android users in the past, but it's getting harder and harder to make that argument.</p><p>Specifically, Spotify's consistent price hikes and YouTube Music's missing support for high-fidelity audio make them tougher to recommend, even for Android users. If those two streamers aren't the best option for Android users, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">their next pick might be Tidal</a> or Amazon Music Unlimited. Both are quality options that remain competitive with Apple Music. But I'd bet that if Apple Music were made by any other company, it'd be an instant Android hit.</p><h2 id="where-spotify-is-falling-short-2">Where Spotify is falling short</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Andrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4654" height="2618" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spotify is the largest music streaming service, with over 700 million monthly active users and roughly 281 million subscribers as of 2025. It's a music streaming giant in every sense, with over 100 million songs available for listening and downloading. Spotify is also incredibly expensive, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-is-basically-telling-subscribers-to-switch-with-latest-price-hike">the company's most recent price hike raising prices by a dollar or more</a> across all of its subscription tiers.</p><p>Spotify was already one of the more expensive streaming services. The platform's individual plan now costs two dollars more per month than the likes of YouTube Music, Apple Music, and Tidal. Amazon Music Unlimited is $1 cheaper monthly for everyone and $2 cheaper for Prime members. It's a relatively small premium to pay, but over time, the extra costs add up.</p><p>People typically flock to Spotify for its excellent algorithms and recommendations. The platform's social features, including the famous Spotify Wrapped experience, are another appealing aspect of the service for fans. I tend to view these extras as both a blessing and a curse. While they're sometimes neat, others are unnecessary — like Spotify DMs — and add bloat to an already-overloaded music app.</p><p>I could ignore them, but the larger issue here is that Spotify is paying <em>someone</em> to develop and maintain these features. If my music streaming bill is $2 higher each month so that my music app is cluttered with another messaging inbox, I won't be happy.</p><h2 id="what-about-youtube-music-2">What about YouTube Music? </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3744px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WWw3aj876uNMGNtfwmv4iM" name="YouTube-Music-Podcasts.jpg" alt="YouTube Music Podcast filter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWw3aj876uNMGNtfwmv4iM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3744" height="2106" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Spotify is out, YouTube Music sounds like the next sensible option for Android users. YouTube Music is a streaming service that's hard to judge, mainly because it is bundled with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> for $13.99 per month. While you can subscribe to YouTube Music Premium individually for $10.99 monthly, the YouTube Premium bundle is certainly the better value. With that being said, YouTube Music Premium is an <em>outstanding</em> perk of subscribing to YouTube Premium, but it struggles to stand on its own.</p><p>Those who thought Spotify was bloated might be even more disappointed with YouTube Music. It now serves as Google's primary distribution channel for podcasts, cluttering the app. You can also find audiobooks on YouTube Music, since the platform taps into the YouTube database. This comes with benefits and drawbacks — you can find niche content that isn't available anywhere else, but you might also be distracted by it.</p><p>YouTube Music's willingness to cram artificial intelligence into the app isn't inspiring for music purists, either. Most recently, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-music-is-testing-ai-generated-backgrounds-for-lyric-cards">began testing AI-generated backgrounds for lyric cards</a>. Many of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-2025-recap-has-a-new-ai-thatll-actually-talk-to-you-about-your-taste">YouTube Music's AI tools</a>, including this experiment, come off as unnecessary.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XfwbFm6ePPoVYnfBaTi7mC" name="YouTube-Music-Beyond-the-Beat" alt="YouTube Music Beyond the Beat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfwbFm6ePPoVYnfBaTi7mC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3488" height="1962" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The big reason YouTube Music's status as a serious music streamer is in doubt is its low song quality. I'll be the first to admit that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/spotify-lossless-audio-requires-this-gear-to-work">lossless quality is unnecessary without the right gear</a>. However, YouTube Music's mere support for up to 256kbps AAC or Opus is lacking even by lossy standards. It just isn't good enough, especially when it's missing Dolby Atmos too.</p><p>If you already planned to subscribe to YouTube Premium and are content with what YouTube Music Premium offers for free, by all means, keep using it. It's an excellent add-on to YouTube Premium. But until the streamer's sound quality and music features improve, it's impossible for me to recommend it as a standalone subscription.</p><h2 id="apple-music-shines-even-on-android-2">Apple Music shines, even on Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UC3Z6BVSwUMfXhPUAHTWgc" name="Apple-Music-Android-2" alt="The Apple Music app running on an Android phone showing hi-res lossless quality." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UC3Z6BVSwUMfXhPUAHTWgc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's Apple Music, a fully featured, noncontroversial music streaming app for Android. The service costs just $10.99 per month while offering hi-res, lossless audio up to 24-bit/192 kbps (yes, that's higher quality than Spotify). There is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">Dolby Atmos support</a>, so you can take your pick of a lossless or immersive audio format.</p><p>Crucially, the app supports every feature Android users care about, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Google Cast</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ap4NHrTJxyHCU9oSE7Byvc" name="Apple-Music-Android-1" alt="The Apple Music app running on an Android phone showing Dolby Atmos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ap4NHrTJxyHCU9oSE7Byvc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like that the Apple Music app isn't littered with unnecessary AI features or other media, like podcasts or audiobooks. It's all about music. There is a surprising amount of customization available, as the app allows users to manage animations, lyrics, listening history, volume normalization, crossfade, and audio quality.</p><p>Best of all, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music supports importing libraries from YouTube Music</a>, Spotify, Amazon Music, Deezer, and Tidal. If you're sticking with Spotify despite the price hike over fears of losing your library, fear not.</p><p>I've been a loyal Apple Music user for a decade and probably won't ever switch. I can't say it's the best music streaming service for everyone. However, it does offer the best music quality and feature set for the price point ($10.99/mo). If you've avoided the streaming service because it's hosted by Apple, you might be missing out.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b2effc96-3f4a-4aa0-9910-ab6f0b5a1655">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Bk52SDpN3SpaJi3Hfb44U.jpg' alt="Apple Music App Icon"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Apple Music</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A steal</strong></em></p><p>Apple Music offers hi-res lossless audio, Dolby Atmos support, and more for the same price as YouTube Music and two dollars cheaper than Spotify per month.

Each time you request a Kindle digest, Instapaper’s servers process the text, collect images, save the data, convert it to a Kindle-friendly ePub file, and then email it to your device.</p><p>With over a hundred thousand people signed up for these digests — the vast majority of whom are on free accounts — Instapaper has essentially been running the service at a loss. By putting the feature behind a subscription, the company aims to cover those rising server and bandwidth costs.</p><p>Beginning February 19, you’ll need to pay for Instapaper Premium to keep using the wireless Send to Kindle feature. The subscription also includes extras like full-text search, unlimited notes, and a permanent archive of your saved items. The cost is $6 per month or $60 per year.</p><h2 id="will-kobo-users-be-affected-2">Will Kobo users be affected?</h2><p>Interestingly, this isn't an across-the-board tax on e-readers. If you happen to own a Kobo, you can breathe a sigh of relief, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/instapaper-send-to-kindle-paywall-imminent-3635014/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reports. Kobo’s integration uses Instapaper’s API instead of the email system Amazon requires, so that feature will stay free for everyone.</p><h2 id="which-features-are-affected-2">Which features are affected?</h2><p>Instapaper’s Send to Kindle feature will soon cost money to use.</p><h2 id="when-does-this-change-go-into-effect-2">When does this change go into effect?</h2><p>Instapaper’s Send to Kindle feature will begin to be paywalled on February 19th, 2026.</p><h2 id="is-there-a-way-to-avoid-paying-2">Is there a way to avoid paying?</h2><p>If you don’t want to pay, you still have options. You can manually download files and transfer them to your Kindle with a USB cable, or use Amazon’s Send to Kindle browser extension.

Meta's text-first social media platform, which emerged as X (formerly Twitter) quickly fell into chaos under Elon Musk, hit a new milestone this month. Threads now has more global daily active users on iOS and Android than X as of early January 2026. As the mobile platform grows, making sure you — and your friends and family — are not accidentally sharing content to Threads from Facebook and Instagram becomes crucial.</p><p>These growth figures from Similarweb reveal that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on mobile as of Jan. 7, 2026, while X had only 125 million (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). Meta's official numbers are even grander. Adam Mosseri, the company's head of Instagram, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DNQuTFlCV9P?xmt=AQF0tIRGbOARi3Kd1ETdMP0kNwNnilI_rn_LmIW7dCvHsA" target="_blank">announced</a> in August 2025 that Threads had over 400 million monthly active users.</p><p>What's driving on this growth? Surely, Meta's willingness to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/metas-threads-ups-its-game-with-new-controls-to-keep-trolls-at-bay">try new things and roll out new features</a> plays a role. Threads allows users to create longer posts without a subscription, offers communities for certain topics and interests, and comes with precise filters.</p><p>Some find the Threads algorithm to be too aggressive and reactive — liking or interacting with a post or two about a trending subject can fill your feed quickly with similar content. However, it's clear that Meta is building a new identity with Threads. It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-cements-itself-as-the-antithesis-of-twitter-as-it-hits-175-million-users">not just a Twitter clone</a>, that's for sure.</p><p>With that being said, I'd bet there's another reason for Threads' successes. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-whatsapp-cross-posting-account-center-highlighted">platform works within the Meta ecosystem</a>, and the social giant makes it easy to cross-post content from Facebook and Instagram to Threads. Cross-posting to Threads isn't enabled by default, but it may be too easy to do by accident, especially if the poster isn't tech-savvy. I've seen countless examples of people sharing way too much on Threads, and it's becoming a problem.</p><h2 id="how-meta-s-cross-posting-feature-works-2">How Meta's cross-posting feature works</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="diVzBzQmTKX3Qx2mwUTxRF" name="Facebook-logo-with-gradient.jpg" alt="Facebook logo on Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/diVzBzQmTKX3Qx2mwUTxRF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As of now, your Instagram and Facebook posts shouldn't be sent to Threads automatically. There were issues in the past causing these toggles to be enabled by default, with some users reporting cross-posting re-enabled itself after being turned off, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/C9xkuwXPdq2?xmt=AQF0T03FunVZSU-B6bhH0vBh1Hozt1o4y8pV_tlHjLCSQQ" target="_blank">according to a thread</a> started by Mosseri a few years ago. Those problems seem to be behind us, and Instagram and Facebook users will need to manually enable Threads cross-posting to use the tool.</p><p>When creating a post on either platform, there's an <strong>Also share on...</strong> setting that lets users control Threads cross-posting. There are two options: <strong>Always share posts</strong> and <strong>Share this post</strong>. They work as expected, with the former option sharing <strong>all</strong> future posts to Threads and the latter sharing just one. You can change this setting on Instagram or Facebook at any time.</p><p>There's a separate toggle available in the <strong>More options</strong> section of the Instagram or Facebook post builder. Under the <strong>Automatic sharing </strong>section, you'll find toggles for <strong>Threads</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, and <strong>Facebook</strong> (depending on which one you're using) that manage automatic cross-posting throughout Meta social platforms.</p><p>In other words, there are two ways to turn Threads cross-posting on in Instagram or Facebook, and both settings should be disabled by default. After it's manually turned on, though, it may be hard for users to recognize it — or know the consequences — if they're not an active Threads user.</p><h2 id="people-somehow-keep-cross-posting-by-accident-2">People somehow keep cross-posting by accident</h2><p>I know that people are posting to Threads via Facebook and Instagram by accident because I've seen it. Complete and unredacted names, addresses, ID badges, forms, and other types of identifying information have appeared regularly on my Threads feed. Pictures of family members, including minors, that were clearly intended for a close friends Facebook group appeared publicly on Threads — and were shared hundreds of times and liked thousands of times thereafter.</p><p>Last week, my suspicions were confirmed. At least on one occasion, this Threads poster below revealed that they shared identifying information unknowingly from another Meta platform. I've gone ahead and redacted the info, but you can see this poster shared a doctor's office form with autofill suggestions for patient names on Threads. I replied, and the poster explained they "posted on [Facebook] and [Facebook] goes to Threads."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r8xdfWth2UfGFGmWeujoxW" name="Threads-Crossposting-1" alt="An interaction on Threads." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r8xdfWth2UfGFGmWeujoxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, we know that's an oversimplification of what's going on here. Meta's cross-posting feature is opt-in. However, all it takes for every Facebook and/or Instagram post to cross-post to Threads is for someone to accidentally hit each of those toggles one time.</p><p>People are clearly finding a way, because it's not uncommon to see content that should've been sent in a close friends group appear publicly on Threads. If the person isn't an active user on Threads, they might not even realize they just shared their address, photos, or personal info on a public platform. Deleting content on the platform it was shared using<strong> does not</strong> delete it from the platforms it was cross-posted to, so users may <em>think</em> they deleted something that is still live on Threads.</p><h2 id="what-you-can-do-to-protect-your-personal-information-2">What you can do to protect your personal information</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oW6Zh4i4bgicP2niY9pxqa" name="Instagram-hero-AC-2024.jpg" alt="Instagram logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oW6Zh4i4bgicP2niY9pxqa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Is it possible that accidental cross-posts are boosting Meta's overall Threads userbase numbers? Potentially, though it's certainly not clear. The bigger issue is people mistakenly sharing information that really shouldn't be posted on the internet under the guise of "close friends" privacy.</p><p>To be clear, this is not Meta's fault. I do think it's too easy for a post to go from a closed-off group to the entire internet — it only takes a few taps — but users do have to enable cross-posting manually.</p><p>Still, this should be a public service announcement, especially for older crowds and those that might not be as tech literate. It's entirely possible that your friends and family members could be accidentally sharing private content with the Threads platform at large unknowingly.</p><p>Educate your friends and family members, regardless of age, that they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-to-remove-your-personal-information-from-results-on-google">shouldn't share any personal information online</a>. It might be worth pointing out the Threads cross-posting toggle specifically as a potential mistake to avoid, because I keep seeing people post private information online, and I don't like it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Motorola makes a few premium phones, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-reminds-me-that-i-dont-need-the-best">better known for its budget offerings</a>. Notably, the Motorola Moto G lineup offers smartphones priced under $300 that come with an incredible value proposition. They won't wow you on the spec sheet, but they're adequate for the price, and that's enough.</p><p>So far, we've already seen three Motorola phones debut in the Moto G 2026 lineup: the budget Moto G Play 2026, the midrange Moto G 2026, and the higher-tier Moto G Power 2026. All of these phones fall firmly in the budget category overall, with the cheapest costing just $179.99 and the most expensive costing $299.99.

Every phone, from the cheapest to the most expensive, is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset. That's good news for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-play-2026-review">Moto G Play 2026</a>, because it now uses the same chip that headlines both the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Power 2026. Between the upgraded processor and newfound support for 5G connectivity, the Moto G Play 2026 has a great foundation for the price.</p><p>Motorola didn't stop there — it also upgraded the display, which is still just an HD+ panel but now supports 120Hz refresh rates. The resolution won't impress you, but the smooth 120Hz refresh rates are certainly a welcome addition. The lack of uniform bezels also clues you into the phone's budget positioning. The Moto G Play 2026 has a noticeable chin with thicker-than-usual display bezels, at least by today's standards.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="WLCkNfC9MkBfDxvxD5LZPj" name="Moto-G-Play-2026-review-1" alt="Moto G Play 2026 charging via a portable Anker charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WLCkNfC9MkBfDxvxD5LZPj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The smartphone also offers support for a few features you won't find on modern flagships. There's a USB-C port for charging and data transfer, but also a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio. You'll also find a microSD card slot on the Moto G Play 2026, and this is crucial because the phone ships with just 64GB of storage. The mere 4GB of RAM here is unimpressive, too.</p><p>The battery is another area where the Moto G Play 2026 keeps up with its higher-priced counterparts. You get the same 5,200mAh battery capacity as the other models, albeit with slower 18W wired charging.</p><p>All told, the Moto G Play 2026 is for those on the tightest of budgets. The single 32MP main camera, weak 8MP selfie camera, and other downgraded specs put it at a clear disadvantage compared to the other two models. Since the standard Moto G 2026 is only $20 more, it's easy to justify the upgrade to the next tier. However, if this is a secondary device or one you're buying for a child, you might not care about the deficiencies.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="223d805a-c561-418b-8b8d-8861dfda68d4">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgnA3NaRP6aQV8ffkBGfuD.jpg' alt="Moto G Play 2026 render front and back"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Motorola</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Moto G Play 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Budget pick</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G Play 2026 is the cheapest device in this year's Moto G lineup, adding key upgrades like 5G for the first time.

The two phones use the same processor with the same amount of RAM, and both run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box. They also both sport the same display, including the benefits (a 120Hz panel) and the drawbacks (only HD+ resolution). Additionally, the Moto G 2026 supports the same connectivity standards, the same IP52 durability certification, and the same 5,200mAh battery capacity.</p><p>In fact, there are so many similarities between the Moto G Play 2026 and the Moto G 2026 that they both have the exact same dimensions. The two phones each measure 167.15 x 76.40 x 8.44mm and weigh 202 grams. That just goes to show how little separates the two models. Luckily, the upgrade to the Moto G 2026 costs just $20 more, so Motorola doesn't have to do much to make this phone a good value.</p><p>Motorola does that by supporting faster 30W charging speeds over USB-C, which will come in handy when you need a quick recharge. Crucially, the Moto G 2026 also offers better selfie and rear cameras. The front-facing camera is an upgraded 32MP sensor. There are two rear cameras: a 50MP primary shooter and a 2MP macro lens. Truthfully, the 2MP secondary camera will likely be inconsequential, but the other two camera upgrades are notable.</p><p>The Moto G 2026 also ships with double the amount of base storage, 128GB onboard, with support for microSD card expansion. For only $20 more, it's worth buying the Moto G 2026 over the Moto G Play 2026 for its better cameras, more storage, and faster charging.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="25536128-7e6b-412d-8113-81c209548e3d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esFGxxNpfXbRrZUPJXZXWT.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Motorola Moto G 2026"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Motorola </div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Moto G 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A middle ground</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G 2026 is the midrange option in Motorola's budget lineup, retailing for roughly $200.

It's priced $100 more than the Moto G 2026, so what extras do you get for your money? Quite a lot, actually. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 processor and 5,200 mAh battery capacity remain the same, but almost everything else has been upgraded.</p><p>For starters, the display is a slightly larger 6.8-inch panel with FHD+ resolution (2388 x 1080) and support for 120Hz refresh rates. This makes the phone slightly shorter, but wider, than the other two Moto G 2026 models.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2026 is also a few grams heavier, weighing in at 208 grams. From a build quality standpoint, the Moto G Power 2026 offers IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 protection</a> against dust and water ingress, which is a major upgrade over the rest of the lineup. The phone is offered in more premium colorways, too, including PANTONE Evening Blue and PANTONE Pure Cashmere.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MHvVZWf2kyooyPP4ExwbFf" name="Moto-G-Power-2026-review-11" alt="Where Winds Meet on the Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MHvVZWf2kyooyPP4ExwbFf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Moto G Power 2026 uses the same chip as the rest of the series, it has double the amount of memory, allowing this phone to pull more out of the same hardware. This model starts with 128GB of onboard storage and can be expanded using the microSD card slot.</p><p>Motorola further upgrades the camera sensors, with a 50MP main camera and a 32MP selfie camera. The difference here is the secondary rear camera, which is an 8MP ultrawide lens that will be much more useful than the 2MP macro lens on the Moto G 2026.</p><p>Looking strictly at the Moto G 2026 series, the Moto G Power 2026 offers valuable upgrades over the field. However, compared to the last-generation Moto G Power 2025, the situation is more disappointing. Motorola didn't upgrade the processor this year and shockingly removed wireless charging, which is a tough sell. If you need the latest Android 16 operating system and an additional two years of OS upgrades, the Moto G Power 2026 might make sense.</p><p>Otherwise, you could probably get away with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>. This year's model is a nice upgrade if you're looking to use the Moto G Power 2026 as your daily driver. The extra RAM and ultrawide camera help it offer more utility than the cheaper Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026. However, for those who don't need the best or want a secondary device, the Moto G 2026 is the sweet spot for $100 less.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="abecb97d-1012-4da3-a607-13726d233ac6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRR4Df6yoThDfZqSUmFHph.jpg' alt="Moto G Power 2026"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Motorola</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Moto G Power 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still strong</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G Power 2026 might have too much in common with its predecessor, but it still remains a strong option within the Moto G 2026 lineup.

The phone is also available for pre-order in select European markets, including Germany and Spain. It comes in three color options: Sunrise Gold, Sky Cyan, and Black.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 made its global debut on November 13, 2025, and unlike the Magic 8 Pro, it is available for purchase in the U.S., albeit a little later than its initial launch.

It follows the familiar slab-style flagship design with flat edges and curved corners, but both the front and back glass subtly curve at the edges, making the phone more comfortable to hold.

As mentioned earlier, the Magic 8 Pro is currently limited to a handful of global markets and is not available in North America, including the U.S. and Canada. The OnePlus 15, on the other hand, is available across most major global markets.</p><p>If both phones are available where you live, then it really comes down to personal preference. Both devices offer some of the best specs and features you can get on an Android flagship right now and should comfortably last you for years. They both pack large batteries with extremely fast charging, capable displays, and solid multimedia experiences, so you are not missing out either way.</p><p>The real difference lies in software. If you prefer a cleaner, faster version of Android, the OnePlus 15 is the safer bet, though it is limited to four major OS updates. MagicOS 10 on the Honor Magic 8 Pro looks heavily inspired by iOS, and if that does not bother you, it is a compelling option thanks to its longer software support, with up to seven years of major updates.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="da7eff6c-0f39-4970-bd13-ebcd3bfacb72">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PmdVgt7s6xoaXZaLCwtXTg.jpg' alt="Honor Magic 8 Pro official render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Honor Magic 8 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A proper Honor flagship</strong></em></p><p>The Honor Magic 8 Pro is easily the most capable device Honor has released in a long time.

Unsurprisingly, AI creation and viewing tools were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/our-big-bets-for-2025/">one of YouTube's big bets for 2025</a> — and the platform is doubling down on the technology as we enter 2026. Notably, while YouTube also mentioned AI guardrails last year, the company plans to push back even harder against AI "slop" and deepfakes over the course of 2026.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tvs-biggest-upgrade-yet-puts-multiview-and-pricing-in-your-control">YouTube</a> says that its creators are "reinventing entertainment" as they produce studio shows and buy Hollywood lots to level up from user-generated content to something more. The brand also touted that YouTube Shorts average 200 billion daily views, and previewed other kinds of posts entering the Shorts feed. Secondly, YouTube is laser-focused on making the platform safe for kids and teens, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/as-social-media-bans-for-kids-gain-traction-this-research-study-shows-theres-a-better-way">not excluding them from it</a>.</p><p>Then, YouTube reaches the elephant in the room, which is AI. It compares AI tools in video creation to the synthesizer, Photoshop, and CGI. Is that a fair comparison, or is AI a greater threat to the spirit of user-generated content creation?</p><h2 id="youtube-is-leaning-harder-into-ai-creation-in-2026-2">YouTube is leaning harder into AI creation in 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6k35NCpzXBJdVWfud97E7Y" name="ask-gemini-about-video-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Ask Gemini about YouTube video on Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6k35NCpzXBJdVWfud97E7Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI isn't going anywhere on YouTube — in fact, it has been "the quiet engine" driving innovations and features on the platform for years, according to the post. However, YouTube seems to be taking a more measured stance on AI this year, acknowledging potential pitfalls and the need for transparency.</p><p>YouTube says more than one million channels used the platform's AI creation tools daily in December 2025. It's also helping creators in other ways, like content moderation for comments or age verification for viewers. In fact, YouTube has gone as far as to use an AI-powered system to figure out the best time to show a YouTube Shopping product tag in a video.</p><p>That's nothing compared to what YouTube is planning to use AI for later this year, though. The platform is teasing AI-generated YouTube Shorts that use a creator's own likeness. Soon, you might see AI-generated creators on your YouTube Shorts feed. Additionally, the platform will add AI-generated games and music experiments, all leveraging AI, to YouTube.</p><p>Still, YouTube promises that "AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement."</p><h2 id="youtube-is-taking-a-hard-stance-against-deepfakes-and-slop-2">YouTube is taking a hard stance against deepfakes and slop"</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3854px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="zPYDgWPFdrfoTVc3XWu6UJ" name="YouTube-Labs" alt="YouTube Labs page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPYDgWPFdrfoTVc3XWu6UJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3854" height="2167" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While there's still plenty of room for AI optimism at YouTube, it's nice to see YouTube acknowledge the real concerns about AI-generated content on the platform. Specifically, YouTube is reinforcing its commitment to transparency. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/ai/" target="_blank">requires</a> creators to disclose when realistic altered or synthetic content is shared on the platform, and YouTube itself labels content created or edited by YouTube AI.</p><div><blockquote><p>We require that creators disclose when realistic content is made with altered or synthetic media, including Gen AI Labels may then appear within the video description information, and if content is related to sensitive topics like health, news, elections, or finance, we may also display a label on the video itself.</p><p>YouTube</p></blockquote></div><p>YouTube is also evolving the existing Content ID system to help creators spot and manage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-rolling-out-likeness-detection-for-creators">when AI-generated content uses their likeness on the platform</a>. From the legal perspective, YouTube is supporting legislation restricting deepfake content, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-supports-the-no-fakes-act/" target="_blank">including the NO FAKES Act</a>.</p><p>Crucially, YouTube has an AI "slop" problem, and it knows it. By slop, we mean "digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence." It has a definition because Merriam-Webster named "slop" its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year" target="_blank">2025 Word of the Year</a>. That's how prolific low-quality, AI-generated content is on the internet today.</p><p>YouTube is taking a stand against slop, weighing its goal of offering a place of free expression against a need for high-quality content.</p><p>"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content," YouTube explained in the post.</p><p>From a viewer perspective, YouTube watchers can expect AI to continue impacting the streaming experience, with features like the <strong>Ask tool</strong> or <strong>autodubbed</strong> content.</p><h2 id="youtube-is-still-putting-creators-first-in-2026-2">YouTube is still putting creators first in 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8" name="youtube-android-central" alt="Android Central's YouTube homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI is a touchy subject for creators, and for good reason.

These current tools are optional, and YouTube is taking critical steps to fight slop and deepfakes.</p><p>That should resonate well with creators. Perhaps the bigger point of impact for YouTube is that it continues to value creator content. It does an excellent job compensating creators for their work, and YouTube highlighted that by the numbers. It paid over $100 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over just a four-year span, and that's a staggering figure.</p><p>What's even more impressive is YouTube's claim that its creator ecosystem "contributed $55 billion to GDP and supported more than 490,000 full-time jobs."</p><p>If YouTube continues supporting creators, both by offering monetary incentives and by building AI tools that help them instead of try to replace them, 2026 should be another big year for the platform.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The foldable market has grown significantly over the years, with players emerging left and right and plenty of models to choose from. Google is already on its third foldable iteration with the rather impressive but iterative <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, but it is still ignoring a rather important form factor: the flip phone.</p><p>Since using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> like the Motorola Razr and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip over the past few years, I've often said that Google needs to throw its own flip phone into the mix. Google apparently disagrees, and the company seems to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/no-google-pixel-flip-yet">no interest in producing a flip phone</a>, but I believe Pixel Flip could be a great complement to Google's smartphone lineup and leverage the growing popularity of the Pixel family in a few ways that would secure its success.</p><h2 id="more-options-for-everyone-2">More options for everyone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3885px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GNuJxZXfk4VcuazZJTzvbE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-OPPO-Find-N3-Flip-Motorola-Razr-Plus.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 5, Find N3 Flip, and Razr Plus side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNuJxZXfk4VcuazZJTzvbE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3885" height="2185" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the main reasons I want a Pixel Flip is that, despite the growing foldable smartphone market, options for flip phones are pretty slim. In North America, Motorola and Samsung are the only options, while Chinese OEMs offer more models overseas but are still overshadowed by book-style foldables. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a> from 2023 was an impressive flip phone, but the company hasn't launched a follow-up since, even though it has produced two flagship book-style foldables in the past couple of years.</p><p>It's becoming clear that companies are much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-foldable-phone-failure-is-over-why-2026-is-set-to-change-everything">more focused on larger book-style foldables</a>, and it's not hard to see why. Companies can make much more from these phones, due to their higher average selling price. This is likely why we see Google focusing on the larger form factor; it can get more money back from each unit sold.</p><p>Still, in North America, where there are only a few relevant names in the smartphone market, having more choice among the available players is a good thing. Not everyone is willing to spend $1,800 on a smartphone, and a Pixel Flip would allow Google to still sell a smartphone at a more accessible flagship price while providing a third major flip phone option from a popular brand, alongside the Razr and Galaxy Z Flip.</p><h2 id="google-can-leverage-the-growing-popularity-of-the-razr-and-pixel-lineups-2">Google can leverage the growing popularity of the Razr and Pixel lineups</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Quite a bit has changed in the few years since I last made the case for a Pixel Flip. Both Motorola and Google have become bigger players in the smartphone market, thanks to the Razr and Pixel.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/global-foldable-smartphone-market-q3-2025">According to Counterpoint Research</a>, Motorola "emerged as one of the standout performers globally" in the foldable market during Q3 2025, after "expanding its foldable base through competitive pricing, strong channel partnerships and favorable product usability reviews." The company has seen impressive growth thanks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola">successful marketing of the Razr series</a>, which offers a range of price points and attractive discounts.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS54017625">IDC estimates</a> that the foldable market will grow by nearly 30% in 2026, while non-foldables will actually see a decline. With the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">Motorola Razr Fold</a> later this year, Motorola is poised to reap the benefits of this surge by offering two different foldable form factors, something Google can and should consider.</p><p>It also shows why Google (and consumers) shouldn't sleep on flip phones. Since Q1 2024, Motorola has maintained double-digit market share in the U.S., remaining the third-largest smartphone brand by shipments, behind Apple and Samsung.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FAXWXmDPe5WLuMMrpMaq5j" name="google-pixel-10-and-pro-and-XL-and-Fold-jade-01" alt="All green colorways of the Google Pixel 10, Google Pixel 10 Pro, Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FAXWXmDPe5WLuMMrpMaq5j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And while Motorola should be enough of a motivator, Google need only look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">its own Pixel lineup</a> to convince itself why a Pixel Flip could still work. These AI phones are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, with Pixel shipments <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-surprise-us-q2-2025-annual-growth-boost-smartphone-market" target="_blank">breaking into the top five in Q2 2025</a>, and the Pixel 10 launch resulting in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-breakout-hit-for-google-in-us">massive surge in sales</a>.</p><p>It's clear that the Pixel is a hit, and while Google currently offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">four Pixel 10 models</a>, a Pixel Flip could easily slot among its higher-end models. Assuming Google keeps its smartphone prices the same and prices a Pixel Flip similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, the lineup could look something like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Google Pixel 11: $799</strong></li><li><strong>Google Pixel 11 Pro: $999</strong></li><li><strong>Google Pixel Flip: $1,099</strong></li><li><strong>Google Pixel 11 Pro XL: $1,199</strong></li><li><strong>Google Pixel 11 Pro Fold: $1,799</strong></li></ul><p>This would position the Pixel Flip as a premium offering, allowing Google to compete with other high-end flip phones while attracting more users who may want the novelty of a foldable phone without the higher price point of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">10 Pro Fold</a> or its successor.</p><h2 id="what-i-want-to-see-in-a-pixel-flip-2">What I want to see in a Pixel Flip</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TKxa5kTNPN4Fj8awJgdBGP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-17" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKxa5kTNPN4Fj8awJgdBGP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Google decided to give us a Pixel Flip, it wouldn't be too difficult to imagine what this might be like. The design could resemble the current Pixel lineup with a mostly flat matte frame and glossy glass back, similar to the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>, plus a wide range of color options. The cover screen would expand across the top panel, as on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> and Galaxy Z Flip 7, with cameras protruding from the bottom corner of the external screen.</p><p>The Pixel can take after the Razr to let users use nearly any app on the cover screen out of the box, something most flip phones still don't allow. We've seen Google optimize the Android OS and apps for book-style foldables, and this could prompt Google to work with developers to better optimize apps for flip phone cover screens, such as continuity, resizing certain UI elements, dedicated widgets/panels, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G7AZhyMbZz5wwPtP8Sgp4C" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-08" alt="Widgets on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G7AZhyMbZz5wwPtP8Sgp4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the Pixel Flip would leverage Google's excellent software/AI and camera capabilities. Motorola has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/first-things-to-do-with-the-motorola-razr-2025-series">Look & Talk</a> on the Razr, which lets you glance at the phone while folded in tent or stand mode to activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>. Google could use something similar with Gemini Live, leveraging what it's learned from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-set-up-gemini-raise-to-talk-on-google-pixel-watch">Raise to Talk</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> to let users jump straight into a conversation with its AI chatbot.</p><p>Google would also make the strongest case for keeping a dual-camera setup on a flip phone. Pixel phones have proven to handle digital zooming better than most other phones, and while many would like to see telephoto lenses on flip phones, a Pixel Flip wouldn't need it.</p><p>Basically, Google could offer the best of both worlds between the Motorola Razr and the Galaxy Z Flip, with a mature UI, strong software support, a functional cover-screen experience, versatile cameras, and more. Now that Google seems to have found its stride with the Fold series, it should shift some of that focus to creating the best flip phone it can.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, the company's finally ready with its permanent fix.</p><p>This week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/thread/403765417/keep-calls-in-portrait-mode-in-the-google-phone-app?hl=en">Google announced</a> that it's starting to roll out that "control" for users to stop the Phone app from surprisingly rotating on them mid-conversation (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2026/01/22/google-phone-app-keep-portrait-mode-on-calls/">PunikaWeb</a>). Google said in its post that the fix that's already rolling out should give users a way to stop the app's "automatic landscape mode" when on a call. What's started arriving for some users is a settings option called "Keep portrait mode."</p><p>The feature's name is pretty on the nose. Nevertheless, the feature lets users ensure that their Phone app keeps its contents in portrait mode, which aligns with how you'd typically hold your device.</p><p>However, alongside this new setting, Google says it's made portrait mode the "default" in the Phone app, per user requests. After the update has reached your device, you shouldn't have to do anything. All calls should remain in portrait; however, if that's not the case, Google walks users through some steps.</p><p>Users can open the <strong>Phone app > Menu > Settings > Display options > Keep portrait mode</strong>. Users can toggle this feature on or off, depending on whether they want a static portrait UI or one that will rotate. According to PunikaWeb, this feature is rolling out widely, so you should begin to see it soon.</p><h2 id="user-feedback-prevails-2">User feedback prevails</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="o5inagdzARJeYyuCLtsu37" name="google-phone-app.jpg" alt="google phone app listing on the play store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o5inagdzARJeYyuCLtsu37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just before the holidays, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-preps-a-fix-for-whats-probably-the-phone-apps-most-annoying-trait">user grievances with the Phone app</a> by Google surfaced, as many reports highlighted its unwanted rotation. What happened was users discovered that the Phone app was abiding by their "auto-rotating" setting, which applies to other areas of their device. For this, think about watching videos or turning your phone when browsing the internet. Unfortunately, when it came to the Phone app, it would rotate while taking a call, likely due to the tilt when placing it to your ear.</p><p>More than that, when the Phone app did rotate, it would split its UI into what resembled a split-view. It was jarring for users and did not sit well. It was reported that Google was testing new "controls" for the Phone app to help prevent this issue from happening. The "keep portrait mode" was spotted in testing from Google, and it seems that it's finally made its way to all users.</p><p>There was another feature spotted in testing, called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-app-may-soon-make-your-urgent-calls-hard-to-ignore">Expressive Calling</a>." If this feature makes it, it would give users a way to make their urgent calls hard to ignore, as they could set a "call reason."</p> ]]></dc:content>

This feature utilizes Gemini on Pixels, which is an AI that Samsung has pushed on its devices, like the Galaxy S25, when users turn on the phone for the first time.</p><p>Gemini's involvement is expected to continue; however, the highlight of this rumor concerns codenames the tipster spotted in Google's code. Allegedly, a recent update for the Phone app by Google provided glimpses into the devices to receive Scam Detection. The tipster states they discovered the following codenames: SM-S942, SM-S947, and SM-S948.</p><p>If you were to dig back into older Galaxy S26 leaks, these codenames reference the base, Plus, and Ultra models. The discovery of these device names here seems to suggest that Google is preparing a formal rollout of Scam Detection for the Galaxy S26 series. The tipster's rumor adds that the upcoming Samsung devices could contain this feature right out of the box, available to users immediately.</p><p>If <em>this </em>is true, then the publication theorizes that Samsung's next flagships could feature Google's Phone app by default.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-getting-in-on-it-2">Samsung's getting in on it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xWNKtwfwBxmw69wGtikRAh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-06" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xWNKtwfwBxmw69wGtikRAh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Scam Detection <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">arrived for Pixels</a> as we approached springtime last year.

The feature leveraged a Pixel phone's on-device AI (Gemini) to "flag text patterns commonly associated with scams." Moreover, for calls, the AI would monitor "conversation patterns" to determine if you might be at risk of a scam.</p><p>Since this rumor is focusing on the calling aspect, it's likely (if true) that the Galaxy S26 would see a similar approach to guarding against scam calls.</p><p>On the topic of AI, there's been some talk that Samsung might utilize Perplexity's intelligence for Bixby.

The Meta Quest store became the Meta Horizon store, and free-to-play Horizon Worlds content was prominently placed in front of users instead of more traditional gaming content. The result was a substantial decline in game sales on the Quest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-joining-forces-to-solve-the-vr-visibility-crisis">backed up by tons of developer data</a> to prove it.</p><p>Many on social media are saying the changes are too little, too late.

"We're going to focus a lot more on the third-party content library and ecosystem that has developed there."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9GiYBHqbVUNdzkifVsHPM4" name="meta-horizon-app-mobile-games-with-meta-quest-3" alt="Mobile games in the Meta Horizon app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9GiYBHqbVUNdzkifVsHPM4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But according to several interviews I conducted after Meta's studio closures on January 13, 2026, Meta let go of several staff who worked with third-party developers and reduced funding to programs like Oculus Publishing. Bosworth wasn't asked about this topic in either of the Davos interviews, but has so far failed to comment publicly when asked on social media.</p><p>Heath's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sources.news/p/why-meta-did-its-big-metaverse-layoffs">interview with Bosworth</a> revealed that Meta is "still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we (Meta) hoped." We saw this trend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-are-eating-vrs-lunch-and-metas-2025-earnings-are-the-proof">begin in mid-2025</a>, although the Christmas holiday period <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-is-outselling-nintendo-switch-2-on-amazon-and-every-other-game-console/">saw the Meta Quest outsell</a> even the Nintendo Switch 2 on Amazon. Even with that success and the success of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/ug-vr-most-popular-meta-quest-game-michael-murdock-continuum-interview/">several new games</a>, Meta looks to be shifting priorities away from first-party development.</p><p>As Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/2013099842529005912?s=20">said on social media</a>, "Oculus had a strong internal mandate to NOT be Nintendo and instead build things that build the ecosystem.  Returning to that is good." "This is not a disaster," Palmer followed up with. Meta "still employs the largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude. Nobody else is even close." Time will tell if that continues to be a good thing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/401524051/star-in-your-own-memes-introducing-me-meme-in-google-photos">its announcement</a>, Google states that this feature is on its way to U.S. users, so keep your eyes peeled. It adds that Me Meme leverages its Gen AI software to turn your photos into "funny, personalized images." What Me Meme generates will be ready for sharing with others.</p><p>Headed for Create, Me Meme will, as previously stated, require a photo from you. Additionally, Google says that the feature will provide templates for users to choose from.</p><p>Google states that Me Meme will provide an assortment of premade templates for users; however, you can upload your own and use that as a base. After the feature arrives, users can head into <strong>Photos > Create > Me Meme</strong>. From there, select a template and upload a photo (an image of you is preferred). The image of yourself that you upload should be a rather clean selfie, one where your face is clearly visible for Google's Gen AI to operate.</p><p>Once the meme is done generating, users can share or save the image. Google Photos will have a "Regenerate" button available, just in case what it produced isn't up to par. There's also the addition of a "compare" button, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/16763021#me-meme">which is said to</a> "compare the uploaded photo to the generated meme."

The 2025 TCL smart TV even has onboard AI processing to adjust and upscale images in real time. </p><p>The Google TV OS also provides instant access to all of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv">streaming services</a>, plus you'll enjoy built-in Chromecast entertainment and support for your personal voice assistant, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> (naturally) and Amazon Alexa. Even if all of the onboard tools provided by the TV fail you, the QM5K comes with three HDMI inputs for your preferred devices.</p><p>Of course, no smart TV is perfect, particularly in this price range. The TCL set's local dimming feature isn't as effective as I would like, leading to a bit of a glare problem in certain light and from certain angles. If you want the best picture possible and can afford to spend a bit more, there are Samsung and Sony models that might be a better fit. But if you want to spend 300 bucks on a Google TV that usually costs much more, this Best Buy deal presents an incredible opportunity. </p><ul><li><strong>TV deals: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/tvs/3944_1060825_447913"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/all-tvs/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/tv-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/40E7E961-A3DD-4E8C-8B88-4274A840DF67?ingress=0&visitId=183fc793-0cec-425f-816d-4e9b1d420367"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/TV-Video/Category/ID-59"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Streaming deals: </strong><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/"><u><strong>Disney+</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.max.com/"><u><strong>Max</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.sling.com/"><u><strong>Sling</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://geni.us/YkQAuWd"><u><strong>Fubo</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/blackfriday"><u><strong>Peacock</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/"><u><strong>Paramount+</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

TikTok went into detaila bout this agreement itself, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/announcement-from-the-new-tiktok-usds-joint-venture-llc?lang=en">announcing the</a> TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. According to the company, this Joint Venture is primarily owned by the United States, meaning operations for TikTok U.S. (data, algorithm security, etc.) are in America's hands.</p><p>TikTok says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://usdsjv.tiktok.com/">this Joint Venture's</a> "mandate" is to "secure U.S. user data, apps, and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures."</p><p>"National Security" is a major part of this, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/poll-results-should-us-ban-tiktok">has been centered in the spotlight</a> throughout this saga. TikTok states that Oracle's cloud environment will secure U.S. user data moving forward. The Joint Venture will also take another look at the app's algorithm, with the post stating retraining, testing, and updates are in the cards. Software assurance is another key point; however, the Joint Venture claims it will "safeguard the U.S. content ecosystem and have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iYp25mxcTDbEQWRud7ondm" name="tiktok-download-no-iphone-tiktok-logo" alt="Demonstrating the many ways to download TikTok on an Android phone while an iPhone sits face down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iYp25mxcTDbEQWRud7ondm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The post adds that interoperability will bring TikTok U.S. toward a "global experience." It states that this Joint Venture will ensure that "U.S. creators can be discovered and businesses can operate on a global scale." With that, it sounds like business as usual for TikTok users. CNN cites comments made by President Trump following the deal's closure, where he expressed gratitude to Chinese President Xi Jinping for "working with us and, ultimately, approving the deal."</p><p>While a deal has been reached, facilitating the TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-statement-on-tiktok-deal">sounding the alarm</a>. Per an official statement, Markey says the U.S., TikTok deal "raises many more questions than answers."</p><p>The senator adds, "Despite my repeated requests for information, the White House has provided virtually no details about this agreement, including whether TikTok’s algorithm is truly free of Chinese influence. This lack of transparency reeks." Markey is also urging Congress to launch an investigation into the specifics of the U.S., TikTok deal to understand its intricacies and to bring about better transparency.</p><h2 id="tiktok-s-u-s-existence-was-topsy-turvy-but-now-it-s-here-2">TikTok's U.S. existence was topsy-turvy, but now it's here</h2><p>TikTok users will remember when the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">went dark early last year</a>. ByteDance informed users that TikTok went down on January 19, 2025 after a U.S. law went into effect to ban its services in the United States. TikTok started displaying messages to users about its services closing due to this law, but (at the time) President-elect Donald Trump stated that discussion might come into play.</p><p>Shortly after, work was already being done to return TikTok's services. The company said, "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service." TikTok came back online, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">went on to avoid a complete U.S. ban</a> a few more times.</p><p>We may still be early on in this deal. For now, it seems that life on TikTok will continue as usual for U.S. users.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung says the phone can get up to 28 hours of battery life while watching videos, and it also features fast charging via USB-C and wireless charging.</p><p>To be sure, the S25 FE isn't meant to offer the best performance in the Galaxy lineup. Instead, it's one of the company's more budget-friendly options, though it still doesn't skimp on most of the features casual users need. Add in water and dust resistance, and the powerful suite of cameras, and it looks pretty appealing even at its normal sticker price.</p><p>The S25 FE normally retails at $710 for this configuration, which offers 256GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 512GB or downgrade to 128GB, but if this mid-level option seems like a good size for your needs, this discounted price might be all the justification you need.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$709.99" data-dimension48="$709.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="HT3UJuEYWHiCkgRjmm34j6" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HT3UJuEYWHiCkgRjmm34j6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$709.99" data-dimension48="$709.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$709.99</del> <strong>$509.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon has chopped the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE to its lowest point yet.

For one, the lowered price point compared to some of Samsung's premium devices makes it a good entry-level pick.</p><p>Despite being closer to the economy-level price point, it still sports a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen has a 120Hz refresh rate, 28 hours of battery life, and 256GB of storage (for this deal, at least).</p><p>Performance is backed by an Exynos 2400 CPU and 8GB of RAM, while it also includes a 12MP front-facing camera and three rear lenses.

Both companies make what's known as "XR Glasses," an evolution from smart display glasses that aim to put a giant virtual screen in front of your eyeballs anywhere you go.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-1s-brings-1200p-visuals-and-a-lower-price-to-the-best-ar-glasses">Xreal 1S</a> just debuted at CES, a follow-up to the excellent Xreal One released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">last February</a>. Its upgrades over Xreal One include a 100-nit brighter micro-OLED display, 2g lighter weight, a new real-time 2D-to-3D conversion mode, and a $50 lower price tag. But Xreal's biggest competition, Viture, is ready to spice the market up with The Beast, the company's first pair of XR glasses with a dedicated spatial computing chip inside.</p><p>That enables Viture Beast to perform native 3DoF tracking, something that was only previously possible with the company's Spacewalker software on a computer or smartphone. Viture Beast is $100 more than Xreal 1S, but it also packs in a camera and compatibility with the wider Viture ecosystem. Which comes out on top? Let's take a closer look.</p><h2 id="spatial-tracking-and-3d-conversion-2">Spatial tracking and 3D conversion</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Geij4t6EU8xDUnDpoutCoj" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-side-lenses" alt="Xreal 1S and Viture Beast from the sides, showing the difference in lens tech when prescription lenses are installed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Geij4t6EU8xDUnDpoutCoj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the reasons I preferred Xreal One over <em>every</em> other pair of XR glasses on the market last year was its native 3DoF spatial tracking. Xreal 1S uses the same X1 chip as Xreal One and Xreal One Pro, so you can expect the same excellent, stable virtual monitor experience that those glasses delivered.</p><p>Viture Beast marks the first time Viture offers a pair of XR glasses with the same capability, but Viture's implementation isn't quite as reliable. To get the best performance, you need to have your glasses sitting undisturbed for 10 seconds after you plug them in for the sensors to calibrate. Xreal 1S doesn't need this to achieve the same stability. Viture told me it's working on better 3DoF stability, but for now, this area is a clear win for Xreal.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

Real 3D uses the X1 chip and an AI algorithm to convert <strong>all</strong> 2D content to 3D in real time at 30FPS. That means any game console suddenly becomes a Nintendo 3DS, and all movies and videos immediately have depth. All you have to do is enable Real 3D in the glasses OSD menu.</p><p>Last summer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-immersive-3d-video">I tested</a> Viture's Immersive 3D tech, which has been available on its glasses via the company's Spacewalker software. The results are impressive and run better than Xreal's Real 3D solution, but that's because it's running on a computer or smartphone instead of the glasses.</p><p>This also means Viture's Immersive 3D is more limited than Xreal's Real 3D, as it can only convert <em>some</em> content on compatible devices. Xreal does everything in-glasses, albeit at a reduced framerate, although Xreal says performance improvements are coming in a future firmware update.</p><h2 id="display-quality-comfort-and-fov-2">Display quality, comfort, and FoV</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bumkm3JBwefYxNcayvVa3W" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-aspect-ratio" alt="Comparing aspect on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S running Hogwarts Legacy on a Steam Deck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bumkm3JBwefYxNcayvVa3W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's an area where things aren't quite so clear-cut. Starting with comfort, I've found that Viture Beast's display is more comfortable at high brightness, while Xreal maintains better comfort at medium to low brightness. Both glasses run at a 120Hz refresh rate with a 120Hz dimming rate. Viture's superior comfort at high brightness comes from the use of DC dimming, but the glasses switch to PWM dimming below 80% brightness.</p><p>Xreal 1S uses a hybrid of DC dimming and PWM dimming across the entire brightness spectrum. If you're not aware, OLED pixels are self-lit but always have to refresh their light every refresh cycle. Some companies use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> to manage this brightness change, but PWM dimming causes headaches, nausea, and other health problems in some people (like me).</p><p>I'm not sure I'd recommend either pair of glasses to flicker-sensitive people because of this. Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/viture-luma-ultra-hands-on-and-limited-edition-cyberpunk-smart-glasses">Viture Luma</a> line is better, as they use DC dimming across the entire brightness range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="55d6FmjUM6XsfbJUnU4WvV" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-dimming" alt="Comparing dimming methods on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/55d6FmjUM6XsfbJUnU4WvV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal is using traditional birdbath optics on the 1S, while Viture is employing what it calls "a hybrid approach combining both birdbath and waveguide." Viture's lenses offer a slightly wider FoV at the expense of some clarity at the left and right edges of the screen. Both Xreal 1S and Viture Beast support a range of prescription lenses. I've got my prescription attached to both, which you can see in the photos.</p><p>In general, I've found that Xreal 1S's display is better for productivity. Things like spreadsheets are simply clearer on the Xreal 1S, and text is generally more legible. Viture Beast's display offers punchier colors, deeper contrast, and slightly higher resolution at 1200p compared with Beast's 1080p. Viture will offer 1200p in a future firmware update, but for now, Xreal is slightly higher resolution because of the taller 16:10 aspect ratio.</p><p>I preferred using Viture Beast for entertainment purposes because of the color tuning on the display. Both glasses offer various color options, but Viture's punchier colors look nicest to me for games and movies.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LLGTTvxgZmiAcPN8Vqtv2W" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-sunlight-visibility" alt="Comparing sunlight visibility on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S with the electrochromic film maxed out" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LLGTTvxgZmiAcPN8Vqtv2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In my testing, Viture Beast offers full 120Hz performance on its glasses, while Xreal 1S seems to top out at 90Hz. Viture Beast defaults to 60Hz, but you can quickly switch to 120Hz in the display settings menu on the glasses.</p><p>Viture's display is also notably brighter than Xreal, something that's often coveted for games and movies. But while the screen tech itself is brighter, Xreal 1S is actually easier to see in any lighting, thanks to a darker electrochromic film implementation on Xreal's lenses.</p><h2 id="a-wearable-monitor-2">A wearable monitor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7oFC7hq9v3VCTPDYNWtXwV" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-maximim-screen-size" alt="Comparing maximum screen size on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7oFC7hq9v3VCTPDYNWtXwV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my favorite things about the Xreal One line is that it offers an OSD menu like a proper monitor. Viture Beast now offers a similar monitor, and while it doesn't offer quite as many options as Xreal, Viture is planning on expanding this menu's options in future updates.</p><p>Viture also offers more buttons on the glasses, giving you more ways to quickly adjust things like brightness, electrochromic dimming, volume, and even display size. Xreal requires you to sift through menus a little more, and since it has half the number of buttons, you often have to cycle through options before finding the one you want.</p><p>Overall, Xreal offers better value and more stability than Viture at this time.

However, if neither of those methods works, the pairing process requires you to manually start again. That's now changing, as Google Home is adding a manual device search option.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-updated-device-setup-3634717/">Android Authority</a>, Google is rolling out an update that lets users manually search for third-party smart home devices directly within the app when QR-based or automatic pairing fails. The new screen shows a list of supported brands, along with a search bar that lets you quickly find your specific device and start the pairing process.</p><h2 id="google-home-now-lets-you-find-devices-manually-2">Google Home now lets you find devices manually</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4658px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.39%;"><img id="SXGL2zvimiKY4rKiSjGgyM" name="google-home-new-setup-process-search" alt="Google Home's new process for pairing a new device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SXGL2zvimiKY4rKiSjGgyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4658" height="2580" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The app now includes a new button called "Add a different way," which brings up a list of popular smart home device makers with a search bar at the top. Once you select a device, Google Home will again prompt you to pair it using a QR code or, if that doesn't work, manually enter the pairing code found on the device or its packaging.</p><p>The publication also notes that, for many devices, the new pairing flow includes images of the product you're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-google-home-multiple-users">about to set up</a>. This makes it easier to confirm you're pairing the correct device before continuing.</p><p>The feature appears to be rolling out widely with version 4.6.55.1 of the Google Home app. If you don't see the new pairing option yet, make sure you're running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app&hl=en">the latest version</a>.
