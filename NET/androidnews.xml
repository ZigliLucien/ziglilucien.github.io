<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung's limited-edition Galaxy Ring looks fresh with a "Two-Tone Titanium Black" color combo (Titanium Black + Titanium Silver), but the tech inside is the same as previous versions.</li><li>Right now, the ring's only available at that one store, and no word on how many are up for grabs.</li><li>You can snag it at the Samsung Gangnam store, or get it with the S25 Edge for 20% off and KRW 100,000 ($70) in Samsung points.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">pulled back the curtain on the Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, but  that wasn’t the only surprise it had up its sleeve. Tucked into the buzz around its South Korean launch was something a little extra for wearable fans: a limited-edition colorway of the Galaxy Ring.</p><p>According to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1%ec%a0%84%ec%9e%90-%ea%b0%a4%eb%9f%ad%ec%8b%9c-s25-%ec%97%a3%ec%a7%80-%ea%b3%b5%ea%b0%9c" target="_blank">Korean website</a>, the new Galaxy Ring is pretty much the same tech-wise as its past versions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-limited-edition-two-tone-color-announced/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). The real standout is its fresh look.</p><p>Samsung calls it "Two-Tone Titanium Black," a smooth mix of the classic Titanium Black and Titanium Silver. There are no photos of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> yet, but it's clear the company is going for a premium vibe here.</p>
<h2 id="bundle-and-save-2">Bundle and save</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KMbUhCn4bUehTLkmfqKTya" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-inside-close.jpg" alt="Looking at the electronics on the inside of the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMbUhCn4bUehTLkmfqKTya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting tomorrow, you can grab this exclusive smart ring at the Samsung Gangnam flagship store, alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>While you can buy the ring solo, bundling it with the Edge gets you a sweet 20% discount on the ring and adds KRW 100,000 (approximately $70) worth of Samsung membership points.</p><p>Sadly, this unique ring is only available at one location for now. Samsung hasn’t revealed how many of these limited-edition pieces are up for grabs. Here’s hoping it'll rethink the strategy and make this cool design available to more countries soon.</p>
<h2 id="same-tech-fresh-drip-2">Same tech, fresh drip</h2>
<p>Aside from the fresh look, the limited-edition Galaxy Ring's core design stays the same, meaning no new features to speak of.</p><p>The existing lineup comes in Titanium Silver, Titanium Gold, and Titanium Black, with sizes ranging from 5 to 15. If you’re unsure about your size, Samsung’s got you covered with a free sizing kit when you order.</p>

From epic trade-in opportunities to free storage upgrades and beyond, keep reading for the best ways to save cash on this Samsung phone before it hits store shelves on May 30th. So far, I&apos;ve seen offers like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-edge/buy/galaxy-s25-edge-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-s937uzsexaa/"><strong>$800 off with eligible trade-in at Samsung</strong></a>, or this Verizon deal that gets you the Edge for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge/"><strong>FREE if you add a line and trade in an eligible device</strong></a>. Not too shabby for a phone that isn&apos;t even out yet!</p><p>In case you missed the big announcement yesterday, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> boasts most of the same great specs found in the rest of the S25 series — including a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and all the latest AI-boosted software features — and packs them into an unbelievably thin, lightweight device. The only catch is that this lightweight build comes at the expense of battery life. Still, the S25 Edge is destined to earn a place among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released this year, and thanks to the following preorder deals, you might get it for pretty cheap too.  </p>

<ul><li>A report claims Meta is pushing ahead with its planned 2026 smart glasses, which could upgrade Live AI to last longer.</li><li>The company is also looking into "super sensing," which is a host of AI features that could include facial recognition software.</li><li>A previous report detailed Meta's plans for its Hypernova glasses, which are reportedly preparing to debut in 2025 with a singular display on its right lens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New reports claim Meta's next planned pair of smart glasses could take its AI facial recognition to new heights.</p><p>Word about what Meta's next smart glasses could provide stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-renews-work-facial-recognition-tech-privacy-worries-fade">The Information</a>, who state there's a wealth of AI behind the lenses (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/next-gen-ray-ban-meta-2026-super-sensing-facial-recognition-live-ai/">UploadVR</a>). According to the report, Meta is supposedly pursuing an upgraded version of its "Live AI." Per the publication, Live AI is being looked at for Meta's 2026 smart glasses, and is designed to "see what its user does and responds in real-time, for hours."</p><p>This is designed to offer quick, hands-free help for users without needing to call the AI forward with its voice prompt. However, reports add that Meta is also looking into facial recognition software for its next glasses.</p><p>This feature is reportedly under Meta's internal "super sensing" codename. The post cites sources close to the matter who claim the company wants its super-sensing to boost the "popularity" of its products. Here's the thing about super sensing: it would enable the smart glasses to keep their cameras and sensors active at all times.</p><p>What's more, sources allege the AI would "remember" what all it saw (through the user).</p><p>The AI could even recognize certain important items like, say, your car or home keys. If this sounds familiar, it's because Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">demoed such a feature</a> for Android XR called "memory." The folks at UploadVR speculate this facial recognition could enable the AI to surface the name of someone you're speaking to. This is likely based on stored information the glasses have from the user.</p>
<h2 id="hypernova-beyond-2">Hypernova & Beyond</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are, of course, privacy concerns with an AI that's always active, viewing what you're doing in your daily life. The report suggests this feature will be an "opt-in" feature that users can freely use and then toss whenever. Additionally, these features are reportedly geared toward Meta's 2026 smart glasses: Aperol and Bellini.</p><p>Meta already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-bans-roll-out-live-ai-and-live-translation-add-new-frames-and-apps">debuted Live AI</a> last month in April. The feature is on its way to its current Ray-Ban smart glasses, bringing a conversational experience. In short, Live AI lets users ask about anything or hold "in-depth conversations with Meta AI without the vocal prompt. The publication's report notes that this feature only lasts for 30 minutes at a time on the current string of glasses.</p><p>As previously stated, Meta will look to extend those capabilities for a few "hours."</p><p>After this reported glimpse of 2026, we should come back to 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">as another report may have revealed</a> Meta's plans for its Hypernova glasses. Hypernova is said to deliver a singular display on the bottom right of its right-side lens. The glasses are reportedly preparing to feature a full set of Android-powered computational hardware and a gesture band.</p><p>The band is said to make it easier to manage what's on your single display.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is testing a new “Discussion” feature for mobile Search, showing up mainly during sports-related searches.</li><li>The feature lets users post comments, reply, and upvote or downvote posts, kind of like a Reddit thread.</li><li>It’s still in beta and only pops up when you search “Team vs Team” in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is currently testing out a new “Discussion” feature for its mobile Search app. Spotted during searches about sports events, this experimental setup pulls in real user takes and drops them straight into your mobile search results.</p><p>SEO consultant Nicholas McDonough shared some screenshots showing what looks like Reddit-style threads coming to Google Search on mobile (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-search-discussions-beta-feature-39393.html" target="_blank">Search Engine Roundtable</a>). The experimental feature would let users post comments, reply to others, and rate posts with simple upvotes and downvotes.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When did Google Discussions beta launch? (mobile only) I’ve seen it tested off and on. cc: @rustybrick @glenngabe pic.twitter.com/L7uJxgQaTa<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1921365910012436671">May 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The early version of this feature is being tested in beta on mobile and only kicks in when you search something like “Team vs Team” in the U.S.</p><p>Before users start chiming in, Google Search lays out the usual sports rundown, including live scores and schedules. Then, front and center, you’ll spot the new “Discussions” tab, ready for fans to jump in and share their thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="sports-only-for-now-2">Sports-only (for now)</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this new feature is still limited to sports stuff for now. When you’re checking out a game card, the “Discussions” tab shows up right next to other sections like “Overview,” “Scorecard,” and “Stats.”</p>

<p>The “Discussions” tab is open to anyone with a Google account. You can jump in, share your thoughts on the game, and once you comment, your profile picture shows up. Other users won’t see your full name unless they hit the “More comments” button at the bottom.</p><p>Even though the setup feels a lot like Reddit or your usual comment section, there’s one big catch—no @mention feature.

<ul><li>Canada gets a dedicated federal Artificial Intelligence minister, marking the creation of this new division as part of the innovation portfolio.</li><li>Prime Minister Mark Carney appointed journalist Evan Solomon to lead this division</li><li>Marking the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence and how it impacts all sectors of society.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has appointed former broadcast journalist Evan Solomon as the new federal Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Minister. This makes him Canada's first federal AI minister (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thecanadianpressnews.ca/national/cp-newsalert-former-broadcaster-evan-solomon-named-ai-minister/article_3db96b2e-9f96-5872-8930-c85e7eeb27e2.html">as reported by the Canadian Press</a>).</p><p>By creating this new division in his cabinet, he will solely be responsible for overseeing the steadfast growth in the sector and its integration into the country's economy.</p><p>Since 2022, the Canadian government has been talking about AI and even introduced bills, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/innovation-better-canada/en/artificial-intelligence-and-data-act-aida-companion-document">Artificial Intelligence and Data Act </a>(AIDA), which was the most comprehensive bill that detailed a national AI framework, but none of these bills have gone to become laws yet.</p>
<p>As of now, Solomon's specific mandates have not been made public. However, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/former-broadcaster-evan-solomon-faces-big-challenge-as-first-ai-minister">National Post</a>, Solomon's responsibilities would likely focus on three main items: "re-igniting Canada’s technology sector, updating its framework policies to deal with a wide range of digital issues, including finding the balance between economic growth and security and privacy concerns, and improving the federal government’s efforts to make better use of digital technology."</p><p>The appointment of a dedicated Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation could be a step in the right direction. To note, the Ministry of Innovation has been part of the country for many years; however, it now has an AI sub-section.</p><p>It is also important to note that Prime Minister Carney's ties to the U.K. and the E.U., and the E.U.'s approach to tech regulation with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a>, might influence Canada's AI legislative direction.</p><p>Canada might take a page from the EU's notebook for some of its principles with tech innovation and addressing the risks beforehand.</p><p>It is also important that earlier this year, President Trump <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fedtechmagazine.com/article/2025/03/ai-czar-david-sacks-means-for-federal-it-modernization-perfcon">appointed</a> venture capitalist David Sacks the first-ever artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar.  While other countries like France and the UAE also have ministers tending to AI within broader portfolios.</p>

<hr>
<p>Audio might progress further than users may expect, as Nothing reveals its latest partnership.</p><p>Today (May 13), Nothing announced a partnership with the renowned British audio pioneer, KEF, in a press release. The purpose of these two companies coming together is to forward an innovative and "refined" audio experience for Nothing's consumers. According to Nothing, KEF's experience in high-fidelity audio should usher in an "expansion into new audio categories" for the company.</p><p>It seems the brand is prepared to move forward with these new categories under the Nothing R title.</p><p>The company states it's looking ahead to bringing "acoustic precision" alongside its recognizable design elements to consumers. Nothing's head of smart products marketing, Andrew Freshwater, says, "By combining KEF’s decades of expertise with our design-led approach to technology, we’re laying the groundwork for a new standard in everyday listening."</p><p>The post teases that there are already a few of these acoustically precise products in development between the two companies. Nothing adds that it is seeking a long-term partnership with KEF to continue opening "new pathways" into expertly crafted audio products for its consumers.</p>

<p>Freshwater adds, "Our products launching later this year mark the beginning of an exciting new chapter of our collaboration and the future of Nothing Audio." In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.kef.com/blogs/news/nothing-kef-audio-partnership">separate post</a>, KEF stated that more information regarding these products will be available "in the coming months."</p><p>There's one thing to note about KEF: the company is known for creating a wide variety of audio products like earbuds/headphones, but also wireless speakers, subwoofers, and more. If Nothing is pursuing new audio categories, perhaps these are some of the products we could expect with its label alongside KEF.</p><p>Nothing has been in the earbud game for a while now, even its sub-brand, CMF, has gotten <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-convinced-nothings-cmf-buds-pro-2-are-the-only-budget-earbuds-worth-buying">into budget alternatives</a>. The company's flagship line stepped into open earbuds with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Nothing Ear Open</a> last year. Despite these being open-ear earbuds (these don't sit in your ear canal), Nothing still achieved some rocking bass when listening to music. Moreover, the Ear Open was quite comfortable in our review of the product.</p><p>The next few months should be interesting, as we await more from Nothing and KEF.</p>

<ul><li>Google has been spotted changing its "G" logo for its mobile app, making it a little more colorful and vibrant.</li><li>The change, spotted on Apple's App Store, brings a gradient that seamlessly blends Google's multi-colors with one another.</li><li>The change has yet to appear on the Play Store; however, it has reportedly been spotted in the Google app's beta.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>You might not have noticed, but Google's starting to give its classic "G" logo a bit of a colorful refresh.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/12/google-icon-update/">9to5Google</a>, the standard multi-colored "G" logo, present on the main Google app on mobile, looks slightly different, per an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942">App Store</a> update. The "G" is still present — even in the same "font," you could say — however, the key difference is its color style. Google has moved away from its clear, distinct sections for red, yellow, green, and blue.</p><p>Instead, Apple's App Store shows these colors blending in a more gradient style.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that the colors briefly take on a different tone before turning into Google's next signature hue. For example, as the red blends into yellow, it's briefly orange, which is what you'd get if you were still taking art class. Yellow and green create a lime-ish green, while green and blue almost make a turquoise color.</p><p>This change appeared on the App Store for iOS devices early this week, but Android <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en_US">has yet to receive it</a>. The Play Store is still displaying the (now) old logo. The publication notes that the logo gradient rolled out to the Google app in beta. It's not yet clear when Android users will see it more widely.</p>

<p>The 9to5 post also notes that this is the first time (in 10 years) Google has done anything to its "G" logo since changing it into what we've come to know. The publication reminds us of the old lowercase "g" against a blue background before the company's app redesign to uppercase in September 2015.</p><p>There's also the old Gmail logo, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-redesigning-iconic-gmail-logo">underwent a font redesign</a> in 2020. The app moved away from the red "M" against an envelope to an "M" that stands on its own with Google's multi-colored design. That change also took a little while before it was everywhere, so Google's behavior in the present day isn't too strange.</p><p>A few months earlier in 2020, Google Photos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-overhauls-photos-new-logo-map-view-and-cleaner-design">picked up a logo redesign</a> that made its pinwheel logo a little less sharp. Previously, the multi-colored pinwheel felt more geometrical, offering straighter edges and sharper points. However, in the summer of 2020, Google opted to soften those edges, as it took on a more "modern" appeal.</p><p>Interestingly, this change comes at a time when Google's Android Show is discussing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">everything new and exciting</a> coming to the OS. Among the updates was talk of Material 3 Expressive, Android's new major design overhaul. There's a chance Google could look to bring this gradient look to more apps, as 9to5 notes, but only time will tell.</p>

<p>Amid the flurry of Google's Android updates today (May 13), Samsung enters the fray with a major announcement for its watches and buds.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/google-gemini-coming-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-buds-smarter-wearables/">Newsroom post</a>, Samsung announced that its Galaxy Watches and Galaxy Buds will soon benefit from complete Google Gemini integration. Not only will Gemini further "extend AI functionalities" across its accessories, but each device will pick up a little uniqueness. Samsung states its Galaxy Watch integration gains "hands-free assistance using natural voice commands."</p><p>Galaxy Watch owners will be able to utilize Gemini for reminders, summaries, and notification reading. For reminders, users can tell Gemini to "remember" what locker they're using or an important task they need to complete. Additionally, you can even tell Gemini to "summarize my last email," which will prompt the AI to give you an "overview" of its contents.</p><p>Samsung states Gemini's intelligence will work across your apps to avoid hiccups and streamline the process.</p><p>When it comes to the company's Galaxy Buds, the post highlights the Galaxy Buds 3 series, as Samsung says Gemini works well with their voice and pinch controls.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Galaxy Buds 3 series</a> features a radical new design with a long stem that features its own touch controls. Samsung says users will soon be able to activate Gemini via their buds and "smoothly interact with your smartphone." Users can quickly leverage Gemini's help for weather forecasts without needing to reach for their phones.</p><p>These updates are set to hit Galaxy Watches and Galaxy Buds "in the coming months." More information about it is likely to surface closer to Samsung's planned release date.</p><p>Samsung's partnership with Google and its AI Gemini continues, especially following the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">the Galaxy S25 series</a>. A more recent update hit S25 users, which brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-update-brings-gemini-live-capabilities-to-samsung-galaxy-s25-users">Gemini Live capabilities to the trio</a>. The update debuted Gemini Live's visual conversational abilities to S25 users for real-time help over an abundance of topics. Gemini Live can be activated by pressing and holding the S25's side button, enabling it to see what you see for assistance.</p><p>Outside of that, Samsung's announcement is well-timed as Google is busy with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/the-android-show-i-o-special-live-blog-everything-coming-to-android-16">Android Show flurry of updates</a>.

<p>If your phone or favorite app suddenly looks a little more stylish, colorful, and friendlier, it’s probably thanks to Google’s new design update it's calling Material 3 Expressive.</p><p>At the upcoming I/O developer conference, Google is set to officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-i-o-2025-prepares-sessions-list-android-xr-ai">show off the next big chapter in Android’s design story</a>, which got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-leaked-its-own-design-process-for-material-3-expressive">leaked earlier this month</a>. It's not just giving it a fresh coat of paint — the company is switching things up in a big way.</p><p>In a fresh blog post, Google explains that M3 Expressive is all about design that feels good, makes sense, and helps you do what you came to do. It leans on five key ingredients, such as color, shape, size, motion, and containment to subtly steer your attention to the stuff that actually matters on your screen.</p>

<h2 id="design-with-feels-2">Design with feels</h2>
<p>The new design direction aims to build interfaces that actually connect with users on a deeper, more emotional level. Big shifts like this don’t just change how Android looks, but also change how app developers build and shape their apps too.</p><p>Google is hyping M3 Expressive as its most heavily tested design system ever, and it has the numbers to back it up. After 46 rounds of design tweaks and feedback from over 18,000 people, the company has landed on a style that leans hard on color, shape, size, and motion to make everything feel smoother and easier to use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:624px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uttUtXu4vhSCZUAkBXXDug" name="Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uttUtXu4vhSCZUAkBXXDug.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="624" height="351" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tech giant conducted its research to look into what grabbed people’s attention in a design, how different visual styles made them feel, and how quickly they could figure out what an interface was supposed to do.</p>
<h2 id="speed-demon-mode-2">Speed demon mode</h2>
<p>Google also went into the specifics with its testing, like figuring out which progress bar made wait times feel shorter, or how big a button should be to hit it easily without covering up the rest of the screen. It even dug into how different loading animations mess with our sense of time while waiting.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company claims that Material 3 Expressive helps users spot key interface elements up to four times faster than the old Material 3 design. Additionally, it levels the playing field across age groups, with users over 45 finding interface elements just as quickly as younger folks, as per Google.</p>

<p>Google I/O season is upon us, but this year, Google is doing something different. Instead of mixing all the exciting announcements in with boring coding events meant for developers, The Android Show is debuting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">a week ahead of Google I/O</a>, bringing all the exciting new Android announcements we all care about, so the developers can stick to their thing next week.</p><p>Today, we’re expecting to hear all about the new Material design update, called Material 3 Expressive, that’s coming along with Android 16. Gemini will make an appearance in new places and on new types of devices this year, bringing new features and enhanced convenience with it.</p><p>Google continues to shore up users against the never-ending threats the internet brings, including new scam prevention features for calls and texts. Lastly, Google looks to have a brief update on RCS communication in the U.S. now that carriers and iPhones have fully moved over to the newest wireless communication standard.</p>

<p>Of all the new announcements today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> is the most exciting. Material design made its debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-ui-design-holo-material-design-material-you"><u>a decade ago</u></a> with Android 6, bringing along a paper-like aesthetic complete with a UI that changed colors based on the app on screen.</p><p>Android 12 debuted the second-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you"><u>Material You</u></a>, allowing users to select the colors <em>they wanted</em> for the UI instead of apps leading the charge. Material 3 Expressive is all about taking the core color tenets of Material You and adding in a touch of liveliness, playfulness, and customization.</p><p>Now, when you dismiss a notification on Pixel phones or other phones that use Android 16’s Material 3 Expressive as its base theme, you’ll see the notification “tear away” from the rest of the notifications in the stack. Animations around the UI now bounce and emit a playful energy they didn’t have before. Even small elements of the UI now have life, like when you adjust the volume slider or pull down the notification shade.</p><p>We saw Google hint at this coming on Pixel phones a few years ago, as the volume and brightness sliders would emit a ticking vibration as if you were rotating a physical dial. Google is also updating dynamic color schemes to offer more user-selectable visual choices than ever before.</p><p>And let’s face it, Material 3 Expressive is a <em>much</em> better name than Material You.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qmTxbQXAdrhH7FuiimNCbC" name="material-3-expressive-notification-swipe-animation" alt="The new notification swipe animation in Material 3 Expressive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qmTxbQXAdrhH7FuiimNCbC.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh my gosh seriously, look at that animation! Notifications are grouped together in a subtle way that becomes clear the moment you try to swipe one away. They almost look like leaves on a vine, as the whole stack gets lightly tugged one way until the one you're grabbing delivers a satisfying "snap" off the group. I can see myself playing with these kinds of animations for hours, how about you?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tEraS5nPSvn48ccV4W4H2D" name="material-3-expressive-notification-shade-quick-toggles" alt="The new quick toggles design from Material 3 Expressive in Android 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tEraS5nPSvn48ccV4W4H2D.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Material 3 Expressive isn’t just about colors. It’s also about improving your overall experience! Foremost to the experience is the revamped notification and quick toggles shade that ditches the annoying black/white color scheme from Material You with a customizable, semi-transparent design. The quick toggle section can now fit 12 or more icons in a single space, and it’s much more customizable than Pixel and stock Android users have seen it in ages.</p><p>Across apps, icons and buttons are now larger, better defined, and easier to find when they follow the new design language. Google says that its own user studies show up to a 4x speed increase in recognition, thanks to the new design. Apps like Gmail are seeing a huge new redesign to put the most prominent action icons right where you can see them instead of being hidden behind menus.</p><p>There’s even a new Live Updates feature that pins a “glanceable live tile” to your notification shade so you won’t miss out. It’s a little bit like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone"><u>Samsung’s Now Bar</u></a> or the myriad of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dynamic-island-android-hole-punch-cameras-overhaul"><u>Dynamic Island-inspired ideas</u></a> on other Android phones, but now properly baked into the base OS itself.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wRWt2YtwxqLnpbyUpUjgsJ" name="material-3-expressive-live-notifications" alt="The new Live Notifications in Android 16's Material 3 Expressive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wRWt2YtwxqLnpbyUpUjgsJ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pinned notifications for important content isn't anything new, but Live Notifications melds the concept with some other recent ideas in an attempt to make them more useful and glaceable. You can see them in the notification shade, on the lock screen, and even on the always-on display. Do you find this useful, or is it just annoying?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:540px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="F63qkTWBhs5cQAXcrCqAnG" name="material-3-expressive-wear-os-6-themes" alt="A quick tour through all the new Material 3 Expressive designs in Google Wear OS 3 on a Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F63qkTWBhs5cQAXcrCqAnG.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="540" height="304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wear OS users aren’t missing out on the brand new Material 3 Expressive design, as Google is totally overhauling significant parts of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6"><u>Wear OS 6</u></a> to fit the new design language. Google continues to embrace the trademark circle shape of most Wear OS watches, further optimizing the UI to look and feel better on non-square displays.</p><p>Google says the new animations and designs “trace the curvature of the display” as you scroll and interact, making it feel like an OS that’s built for a circular watch rather than looking at a square OS through a circular window.</p><p>This even includes new shape-morphing elements that scale better between screen sizes, so you can enjoy the best experience on smaller watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review"><u>Pixel Watch 3</u></a> without having to opt for a more massive option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:540px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="g66WNsr94kKKwxFvNhTG9b" name="material-3-expressive-wear-os-6-themes-2" alt="New Material 3 Expressive themes in Wear OS 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g66WNsr94kKKwxFvNhTG9b.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="540" height="304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you might expect from Material 3 Expressive, Wear OS 6 will be integrating a lot more customization via color options and a more customizable UI. Watch faces can now define the color of the entire OS, so your themed experience is felt throughout instead of just on the watch face.</p><p>Google says the new button and notification design is made to “hug the display” as it moves, taking up as much real estate as possible and making the most of the screen. There are even new stretchable buttons that are easier to tap, so you don’t have to be quite as precise with actions. I’ve found small buttons on watches to be a pain more than once, so this is a welcome change!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini is on its way to more devices than ever, starting with Android Auto, TVs, and Wear OS. As expected, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show"><u>Gemini is replacing Google Assistant</u></a> on every device Google can pack it in, enabling more natural speech and actions than Assistant could ever offer.</p><p>But it’s not just about letting you be your awkward self and still get things done. Gemini ties into more Google apps than Assistant could, giving you the ability to quickly search emails from your wrist with just your voice, or set complex reminders with multiple actions.</p><p>Responses are much better than before, too, as Gemini uses more natural language and delivers glanceable information on wrists and in cars when you don't want (or can't) to look at a screen for a long time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RsE7shvNu34jmjcCLgv374" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsE7shvNu34jmjcCLgv374.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve never been a fan of having a giant touch screen to further distract me from the road, and apparently, Google has been listening to critics as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show">Gemini integration into Android Auto</a> is making things more hands-free and <em>eyes-free</em> than ever. Gemini will be able to do tons of new things completely hands-free, whereas before you had to scroll through lists and tap lots of buttons, acting as a distraction from driving instead of a helpful tool.</p><p>Google says Gemini will be able to read messages out loud and not only allow you to reply to them in real-time, but it can also translate messages before they’re sent.</p><p>Gemini can also summarize text threads, emails, and other notifications so that you can get an idea of what’s happening while you’re driving without having to manually navigate through all the fluff. It sounds like a dream come true, really, and it’s coming later this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kr7mzDHWSJvi8ZroNu954H" name="Gemini-on-Android- XR" alt="Planning your vacation with Gemini on Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kr7mzDHWSJvi8ZroNu954H.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google TV is also getting the Gemini upgrade, which should help you find what you want to watch next without worrying about which service has it available.</p><p>Later this year when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses"><u>Samsung’s mixed reality headset</u></a> launches, Gemini will power the experience in ways we’ve never seen before. Google says that Gemini in-headset "can help you do things like plan a vacation by surrounding you with videos, maps, and local tips, creating an entire itinerary in minutes while providing a more."</p><p>This should be a lot more visual, interesting, and powerful than trying to navigate all of this stuff on a tiny phone screen. Google previously said that Gemini through a mixed reality headset or smart glasses can also control actions in the headset, so you could likely ask it to help you perform actions for you instead of following a tutorial.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever been the victim of fraud, you know how bad it feels to have someone trick you or steal your identity. Thankfully, Google is using AI in a way we’ve all been wanting: to help stop criminals in their tracks before they can swindle you out of your hard-earned money.</p><p>A bevy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-show-io-2025-security-privacy-details"><u>new security features</u></a> is coming to all Android phones, not just ones powered by Android 16 later this year, and it all adds up to a more secure, comfortable smartphone experience. Paramount to these features is a new warnings system built into the Android dialer and Google Messages which help prevent fraud by popping up messages when common scam tactics are used.</p><p>One example Google used is that apps won’t be allowed to be sideloaded while you’re sharing your screen, and banking apps will now warn you that someone is watching before you accidentally share confidential information with “tech support” on the other end. It’s a series of huge new moves Google is making to help make its users feel safer online, and it’s <em>great</em> to see!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:283px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:212.01%;"><img id="cqyqTvesS8VWbxRK7vaTm4" name="google-play-protect-live-threat-updates" alt="Google's Live Threat Detection for Play Services shows an alert of an "unsafe" app found from a malicious developer.

<p>A new live threat detection feature will keep track of app changes, helping to prevent apps from abruptly changing their names or icons in order to hide from a user. This commonly happened with scam apps as it would prevent users from uninstalling them since the app changed its name or icon after being installed. This one is coming to <em>all</em> Android phones with Google Play Services installed.</p><p>Google Messages is also getting a big security update with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">AI-based detection</a> that can help stop scammers pretending to be toll road authorities, bill collectors, crypto scams, financial impersonation, gift card and prize scams, "tech support" scams, and several other new categories. These messages will be automatically flagged and filtered as spam if spam detection is enabled.</p><p>Users can also participate in a new Key Verifier program in Google Messages on phones running Android 10 and higher. Key Verifier uses public encryption keys to further verify end-to-end encrypted messages, so you can be <em>sure</em> that the person you're texting is actually that person and not an impersonator. Key Verifier is launching this summer.</p>

<p>Some of us are still a bit undecided about the design changes coming with Material 3 Expressive. However, something that did catch my eye was seeing the floating bars appear at the bottom of some of the apps.</p><p>In the example above, Fitbit lets you jump between time frames for whatever information you're looking at. The Google Photos app seems to be making it easier to share and edit your pictures without jumping through a bunch of menus.</p><p>IMO, it's a much better solution than sticking a bunch of menus and sub-menus behind a hamburger menu.</p>

<p>Shortly after The Android Show wrapped up, Google surprised us with a new beta. Unfortunately, this doesn't include the Material 3 Expressive design changes that were shown off. Instead, it's <em>just</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/release-notes#beta4.1">Android 16 Beta 4.1</a>, which includes a number of bug fixes.</p><p>We suspect to learn more about the new design changes and anything else that Google didn't show off today. I/O 2025 will kick off at 1 PM ET on May 20 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. And has been the case for a few years, you'll be able to watch the Keynote alongside everyone else.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the presentation, Dieter Bohn, Android Central alumnus and Director of Product Narrative at Google, was showing off some of the latest devices to be released. These included the Pixel 9a, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/should-you-buy-the-motorola-razr-ultra-2025">Motorola Razr Ultra</a>, along with foldables on one end of the table and a tablet propped up on the other.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSvFbPYQDlI">Shane Craig</a>, this isn't just another Samsung device being shown off, as it's actually running what appears to be Google's revamped Desktop Mode. Unfortunately, there aren't any close-ups of the tablet showing off the interface more than the floating windows and taskbar.</p><p>It's difficult to really discern, but Craig goes on to suggest that this could have been our first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet/i-dont-want-the-pixel-tablet-to-die">Pixel Tablet 2</a>. To me, it looks more like a Samsung Galaxy tablet that's running stock Android as opposed to OneUI, but who knows? Maybe Google will have a surprise for everyone at I/O next week.</p>

And for Galaxy Buds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Buds 3 Pro</a>, users will be able to easily trigger Gemini without reaching for their phones.</p><p>Now the question remains: who will get Gemini on a smartwatch first?

<hr>
<p>Get hyped; it's Google I/O season, and the company's new Android Show: I/O Edition is helping to fuel the excitement. It details everything new with your security.</p><p>In a press release, Google stated that there are a few ways it will look to strengthen your Android device's security and privacy for calls, texts, and more soon. The company states the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> ranks "highest" in Android security and anti-fraud efficacy. To further this, Google says it's first looking to enhance the ways your Android phone can shield you against phone scams.</p><p>To do this, Google states it's working on ways for Android's software to block "specific actions" and offer additional warnings against scam attempts. The post adds that all of this happens on your device for calls with people not in your contacts. What's more, if you're sharing your Android screen during a call and it ends, the OS will prompt you to stop sharing to avoid any unwanted attention.</p><p>Speaking of screen sharing, "enhanced in-call protection for banking apps" aims to stop fraud. According to Google, Android will soon warn users who've shared their screen while on a call when their banking app is launched. These warnings will occur with people outside of your contacts. The warning alert will inform users of the dangers, as well as offer a button to quickly end their shared screen session.</p><p>Google states this will roll out for supported banking apps on devices with Android 11 and higher. The pilot program is looking to grab U.K. banks first "in the coming weeks" before looking at a wider rollout.</p>

<p>Scam detection in Google Messages is receiving upgrades, as well as the introduction of the Key Verifier.</p><p>Regarding the former, the company says its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">AI-powered Scam Detection</a> software in Messages has been refined to target additional malicious attempts. Such scams include toll road/billing, crypto, financial impersonation, gift card/prizes, technical support scams, and more.</p><p>The Key Verifier is a new feature Google is preparing to launch to better enhance on-device fraud protection. In short, the post says the Key Verifier will let users verify the identity of the person on the other side through "public encryption keys." An example where the Key Verifier can work is during a SIM swap attack. Google says this can happen when an attacker removes your friend's or family member's SIM card and places it into an alternate device.</p><p>If this happens, Google Messages verification of them will disappear, informing you visually that the person texting you is not who they claim. To verify contact keys, Google says users can do so via the Contacts app with a QR code scan or number comparison. The Key Verifier is expected to launch "this summer" on Android 10 and higher.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-enable-identity-check">Identity Check</a> left beta earlier this year, and quickly rolled out onto Pixel devices rocking Android 15 alongside the Galaxy S25 series (and One UI 7 phones).</p><p>The feature works by leveraging your biometrics with other safeguards to verify that the phone in question truly belongs to you. Google says it's working to extend this feature's availability to more devices through Android 16. Also, the feature's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/factory-reset-protection-what-you-need-know">Factory Reset protections</a> will get a glow-up, restricting all device functions that have been reset against the true owner's authorization.

While this program was initially geared toward "high-risk" users like journalists and public figures, this extension of security will ensure more people can get in on Google's more robust security efforts to protect their data.</p>

<p>Google Play Protection is preparing to introduce live threat detection that will inform users if a developer has maliciously changed or hidden their app icon. The feature will roll out to Pixel 6 and higher devices, as well as a "selection" of other phones, in the coming months."</p><p>The company concludes by stating it's updating the rules of its Live Threat Detection to better catch threats via apps. These bolstered changes are available globally for all Android devices with Google Play Services.</p><p>The Android Show's security and privacy updates are likely a prelude to even more Android OS announcements from Google later this month.

Google announced during the show that it will be bringing Gemini's smarts to more devices that people use daily.</p><p>It started by replacing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-switch-from-google-assistant-to-gemini-might-kill-nest-speakers-and-displays">Google Assistant with Gemini </a>earlier this year, and things have just taken off since then. Now, it's expanding Gemini's power to Wear OS, Google TV, Android Auto, and even Android XR.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XhWgAgmmjezkdQ9PtrZdQ" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XhWgAgmmjezkdQ9PtrZdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To start, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will be integrated into Wear OS, helping users stay on top of things straight from their wrists. During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-teases-a-special-i-o-edition-of-the-android-show">The Android Show</a>, Google showed off how Gemini on Wear OS will help users stay more productive and work hands-free when they're unable to get to the phone.</p><p>"Like when your hands are covered in flour while cooking, when you’re rushing between meetings, or when you’re in the middle of a bike ride," Google explained in the press release.</p><p>All users need to do is summon Gemini with their voice and give it a command. Google says it doesn't have to be a fully thought-out sentence; it could be as brief as, "Hey Google, remember I’m using locker 43 today.” Or users could even ask Gemini about the restaurant their friend emailed about and get the answer on their wrist, as seen below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cars are also getting a Gemini-sized upgrade on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>. While voice commands have been at the center of Android Auto, with Gemini, the tech giant says users can do more on the move.</p><p>Gemini, built into Android Auto, will be a more intuitive assistant that can gauge what the user wants "through natural conversations." So instead of hitting on the right response or choosing the right text to send, Gemini will let you do all of that hands-free.</p><p>Google says Gemini can find you a location that exactly fits your needs. For instance, you can give it a complex command like, "find me a charging station on the way to the post office that’s also near a park, so that I can go for a walk before your errands while your car is charging."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RsE7shvNu34jmjcCLgv374" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsE7shvNu34jmjcCLgv374.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, users can integrate Gemini with their messaging apps to summarize messages and even translate their replies into another language before sending, as seen in the GIF above.</p><p>During your morning commute, you can ask Gemini to give you "the rundown of the news today (but without sports), or get a quick synopsis of the book that you didn't get around to finishing before your book club meeting," Google added.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2114px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.10%;"><img id="FFKYyQXyJdWcr8dL2soRHc" name="Android-Auto-Gemini-message" alt="Android Auto integrated with Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFKYyQXyJdWcr8dL2soRHc.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2114" height="1186" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini Live on Android Auto is integrated to translate texts in over 40 languages, and users can edit that message without having to start from scratch, just with a voice command. Gemini will be available on Android Auto "in the coming months, followed by cars with Google," the press release added. This integration will also be shown at Google I/O later this month.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tGe4pXzQUGEtwAgr2svTB3" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tGe4pXzQUGEtwAgr2svTB3.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/you-can-play-retro-games-on-practically-anything" target="_blank">Google TV </a>is also getting a slice of Gemini Live. From asking the TV to play age-appropriate shows or movies for the kids to answering questions about the solar system by pulling up the perfect YouTube video, Google TV is said to go beyond just showcasing entertainment.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-in-the-world-of-android-xr-2">Gemini in the world of Android XR </h2>

<p>Google is taking Gemini a step further, integrating it into the world of Extended Reality — this includes next-gen devices like XR headsets and smartglasses.</p><p>While Google didn't mention anything about its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">smartglasses </a>that could be in the works, the company confirmed that Gemini will be integrated into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses" target="_blank">Samsung's XR headset</a>, which is set to launch later this year.</p><p>Google says that with the Samsung headset and Gemini Live collab, it "can help you do things like plan a vacation by surrounding you with videos, maps, and local tips, creating an entire itinerary in minutes while providing a more," giving a sense that they're already at their vacay spot even before getting on the plane.</p><p>Finally, Google hinted that Gemini will be coming to Sony and Samsung's audio systems, "bringing you personalized, powerful, and proactive help—wherever you are, on whatever Android device you’re using."</p><p>You can catch all the announcements from The Android Show and get even more in-depth analysis on our exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/the-android-show-i-o-special-live-blog-everything-coming-to-android-16">Live Blog.</a></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I remember when the first Kindle debuted. "It looks just like paper," they said, and I didn't believe it until I finally got my hands on one several years later. Since then, E Ink has evolved into an entire display category that covers the gamut of devices, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, monitors, and even full-fledged PCs.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div>
<p>But, unlike its early iterations, E Ink doesn't have to be just black and white. Like real ink, E Ink now comes in a variety of styles that allow up to 4096 colors to be displayed, giving you a sort of muted, pastel palette. E Ink provides a contrast level that's similar to OLED when the frontlight is off, giving you literal <em>inky blacks</em> in the darkest parts of the image.</p><p>While I've had the chance to mess around with most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best E Ink tablets</a> to date, I only recently got my first <strong>color E Ink</strong> tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bigme-Read-Write-Thickness-Computer-Touchscreen/dp/B0DM1LJRSJ">Bigme B1051C Pro</a>. Sure, it's not a name that rolls off the tongue, but you'll forget that the moment you pick it up. It's 1.5mm thinner than our favorite color E Ink tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C</a>, and it comes in at 45g lighter than that tablet, too.</p><p>Plus, with 50% more RAM and a version of Android that's 2 years newer, you can do a lot more with it than you probably expect.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-heck-is-color-e-ink-anyway-2">What the heck is color E Ink, anyway?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="gWLbjnxKN4xJjKRmf4DwW5" name="Color-Print-ePaper_Kaleido_scheme_ENG" alt="The E Ink company's explainer for how color E Ink works" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gWLbjnxKN4xJjKRmf4DwW5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: E Ink)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might already know what E Ink is and how it works, but just in case, here's a quick refresher. Traditional displays use a backlight that is then filtered through a red, green, and blue color filter to create colored pixels. The image you see is made up of millions of these pixels aligned in a grid pattern, which is what the resolution of a display means.</p><p>E Ink uses magnetically charged spheres that are either black or white. These spheres are then physically pulled to the surface to create the image you see. Instead of a resolution measurement, E Ink is usually measured in DPI — that's dots per inch, like an ink printer is measured. E Ink is reflective by nature and is easier on the eyes since it doesn't require artificial light to illuminate the display.</p><p>Color E Ink is a hybrid of these two technologies, utilizing the magnetically charged sphere design of E Ink, which is collected into color filters more like a traditional display. This means that color E Ink retains the reflective, eye-friendly nature of E Ink displays while allowing for some of the color produced by a traditional display.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HY8n-T2z9Zs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>To see this in action, check out the video above at the 1:15 timestamp. As you watch, pay attention to how the display uses each of the red, green, and blue "sub-pixels" while the image on the screen changes. When those negatively charged white particles are pulled into one of these chambers, you'll start to see color appear.</p><p>The colors on screen have a pastel hue to them because the white particles are the base color, effectively making each color filter lighter than it really is. When a positively black particle is pulled into the chamber, it goes completely dark, looking properly "inky black" just as an OLED might be described.</p><p>All of this combines to make the Bigme B1051C Pro's display look like each frame was printed on a piece of paper. It's incredible, and the fast refresh rate of the E Ink Carta particles inside ensure that it's more able to keep up with the demands of modern apps than previous generations of E Ink displays could.</p>
<h2 id="a-regular-tablet-but-different-2">A regular tablet, but different</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Cdv5QeFgaFnZn45pQtVzUD" name="bigme-b1051c-pro-display-close-icons" alt="An up-close look at the texture of the Bigme B1051C Pro's color E Ink display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cdv5QeFgaFnZn45pQtVzUD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OK, so how can a color E Ink tablet be "a regular tablet" but also be different? Like any technology, the Bigme B1051C Pro has its advantages and disadvantages. If you have a tablet and regularly use it for web browsing, emailing, reading books, comics, or manga, or just use it as a secondary device for social media or communication apps, this tablet is going to blow you away.</p><p>However, if you just use your tablet to binge-watch shows, something like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-pad-v9-review">Honor Pad V9</a> is probably a better choice. I don't watch videos on tablets, though, so this product makes a lot of sense for me. This is effectively a laptop replacement for me because I do almost all the same things on it that I do on my work laptop — the big exception being the photo and video editing that's required for my work.</p><p>Outside of those, though, everything from reading forums and researching topics to writing articles and even watching YouTube videos is entirely possible on the Bigme B1051 C Pro. You're likely not going to want to binge-watch the latest Netflix shows on this display, but watching anime on it is uniquely interesting because it feels like watching a manga that came to life.</p>

<p>The Bigme B1051C Pro is powered by Android 14 and comes with Google Play support out of the box, plus the inclusion of several Bigme exclusive apps. One of the highlights is BigmeGPT 4.0, which Bigme says is available for life without a subscription and enables realtime translation, transcription, and all sorts of useful note-taking features.</p><p>Each tablet comes with a stylus that feels more authentic to write with than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-multiple-s-pens-on-your-galaxy-phone-or-tablet">the S Pen</a> on Samsung Galaxy phones, for instance. The matte layer on top of the Bigme B1051C Pro's screen has a texture that feels a bit like writing on construction paper and it's impressively tactile and comfortable, unlike writing on glass.</p><p>The stylus doesn't need to be charged, yet it looks and feels like one that does. While it doesn't have pressure levels like some active styluses provide, it does magnetically dock on the top of the tablet for easy storage.</p><p>Bigme sent me its keyboard case with the unit, as well, and it feels a lot more capable and comfortable than cases I've used for other E Ink tablets. First off, it's actually sturdy and doesn't feel like it's doing to fall over if I don't have it perfectly positioned. The kickstand is part of the cover and folds back to any position you need.</p>

<p>The keys have excellent travel and feel similar to most modern laptops, which are all pretty similar to the MacBook Pro design these days. The keys are a little more cramped than those on bigger laptops, though, so it's worth noting that bigger hands may have trouble.</p><p>I also <em>love</em> the touchpad provided, as it's an ideal size relative to the keyboard and is impressively responsive. When the tablet is attached to the case, it's activated via POGO pins and automatically registers with the tablet. That gives you instant mouse and keyboard support without any pairing or charging nonsense.</p><p>My one complaint with the tablet is the battery life, which is not terrible, but it's not quite to the level I expected out of an E Ink tablet. You'll get several hours of use on a single charge, but I expect something more along the lines of <em>days</em> of use out of a device like this. At least it uses USB-C, which is ubiquitous these days.</p>

<p>The obvious question is, why would you opt for only 4096 colors on an E Ink display when LCD and OLED tablets can give you millions or billions of colors? The main reason is eye health.</p><p>Since E Ink doesn't require a backlight to be visible, you can opt for environmental lighting that's significantly easier on your eyes over time. That's most important for the devices that you're using for hours every day, as it cuts down on eye strain from backlit LCDs or direct-lit OLEDs over time.</p><p>It also means that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">the ultra-bright displays of today</a> aren't needed to overcome the sun when outdoors, since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/testing-three-eye-friendly-display-technologies">E Ink displays accept and reflect</a> a portion of the light just as a normal piece of paper or a book does.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MdCcDEqeQBjR6D7JnP4s8J" name="e-ink-vs-lcd-vs-oled-reading-in-sunlight-1" alt="Comparing outdoor reading capabilities of LCD, OLED, and E-Ink tablets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MdCcDEqeQBjR6D7JnP4s8J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But aside from the limited color palette, E Ink isn't the perfect alternative to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">LCD or OLED</a> just yet. The biggest problem is the refresh rate, which falls squarely into the photosensitive epilepsy range of 3-30Hz. E Ink Kaleido 3 has the potential to refresh at up to 60Hz, but it often falls close to the sub-20Hz range.</p><p>Companies like Bigme don't normally highlight the specific refresh rate of these types of devices, normally sticking to marketing terms like "SSS super speed" instead of an actual number. Whatever the exact number is, it's not quite 30FPS as it doesn't match the smoothness of an LCD or OLED display running 30FPS content side-by-side in my testing.</p><p>This means that while color E Ink checks almost all the boxes required to help the most flicker-sensitive users, it still needs improvement with the refresh rate so that the full screen refresh cycles don't result in visible white/black/white flickering. The E Ink Corporation is hard at work on Kaleido 4, which is expected to deliver something like this, but until then, E Ink devices remain the most useful for reading, taking notes, writing, and light web browsing.</p>

<p>While Samsung still hasn’t stopped rolling out One UI 7 updates to older Galaxy models, new information reveals what to expect from the next operating system, One UI 8.</p><p>According to the latest APK teardown from the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-listen-brief-now-brief-apk-teardown-3556952/">Android Authority</a>, new findings from One UI 8 firmware have revealed that Samsung is working on a Listen Brief button, which seems to be an enhancement over the existing Now Brief feature — introduced in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>.</p>

<p>For the unaware, One UI 7’s Now Brief feature is a Galaxy AI-powered personalized summary of the day that showcases weather, other suggested content and actions that can be done during the day. While it is majorly text-based, new findings from One UI 8 firmware reveal that the company is working on a new “Listen Brief” button.</p><p>According to the publication, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>, the upcoming Listen Brief is notably an audio version of the same as it will also likely offer a summary of the user’s morning, afternoon, or evening — further including weather forecasts, calendar events, preferred news, and traffic updates.</p>
<h2 id="an-upgrade-over-the-one-ui-7-s-now-brief-2">An upgrade over the One UI 7's Now Brief?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-now-brief-news" alt="Now Brief News on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seemingly, the Listen Brief makes it more handy than the Now Brief already is as it eliminates the need to read long text summaries, which can be a useful feature for busy people on the go. It might also be a helpful accessibility feature for those who are visually impaired.</p><p>The hidden code from the One UI 8 firmware in the findings also indicates that users should be able to choose from either Samsung or Google’s text-to-speech engines. Further, they will also be able to play, pause, or stop the audio briefing, which means they could also expect playback controls for the Listen Brief functionality.</p><p>While Now Brief itself can be improved in so many ways with new incorporations, One UI 8 should likely bring them starting with the Listen Brief. Users have to also bear in mind that since the feature is currently being tested, it may or may not be seen in the final release of Samsung’s next notable operating system.</p>
<h2 id="more-one-ui-8-leaks-2">More One UI 8 Leaks</h2>
<p>In other One UI 8-related news, the operating system should additionally bring some exciting new features, per the recently spotted and rumored features. The operating system <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-could-get-you-a-secret-vault-for-your-photos-in-one-ui-8">is tipped</a> to be bringing a secret vault for photos.</p><p>Also, new ‘Actions’ via Google Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/alleged-one-ui-8-watch-leak-samsung-gemini-actions">were spotted</a> in an alleged One UI 8 Watch leak.

<ul><li>Google Keep's web client gains support for rich text formatting (bold, underline, italics, headings), aligning it with the Android app's capabilities.</li><li>The latest formatting options are accessible through an underlined "A" button and are available to all Google Workspace customers next to personal Google account users.</li><li>As the roll out of the feature has just begun all users should be able to see the feature in the coming days or weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has announced a bunch of Workspace updates late last week that include Google Keep, and features to the Gemini app as well.</p><p>Google Keep has gained significant improvements for its web client, and they include features like rich text formatting. This feature has been available for Android devices for quite some time now — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-text-formatting-rollout">since 2023</a>, to be precise — and it has finally arrived for the web version, the search giant has announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/05/release-notes-05-09-2025.html">Workspace blog post</a>.</p><p>The latest expansion here includes text customizations like the ability to add "text through bolding, underlining, italicizing, and heading styles on the web." While Google Keep for web has been around since its inception, these text customizations were long awaited, especially since they were available for the Android client.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.17%;"><img id="dTVeNPexmDXa8UEAi6RkLi" name="Google-Keep-rich-text-formatting" alt="Google Keep's new text formatting features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dTVeNPexmDXa8UEAi6RkLi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="284" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google further notes that the text formatting features are available for the Google Keep web client for users including Rapid Release and Scheduled Release domains, all Google Workspace customers, Workspace Individual Subscribers, and anyone who uses a Google account and the notes app. Since the rollout has just begun, all users are expected to see the feature in the coming days or weeks.</p><p>The aforementioned users can find the new underlined "A" button, which gives users formatting options. Users will be able to see the H1, H2, header options alongside options like Bold, Italic, Underline, and Clear formatting features, as mentioned above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U8k7wuQ6HDsY2v9tw7TeBF" name="google-pixel-5a-google-keep.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 5a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8k7wuQ6HDsY2v9tw7TeBF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664857/google-keep-rich-text-formatting-web-app">The Verge</a> notes, it is still unclear whether the already structured notes from the Google Keep app client will sync with the web version automatically or is applicable only for the new notes created on the web client. It should be clearer once the wider rollout begins.</p><p>It is encouraging to see the search giant finally bringing these features to the web version of Google Keep. The new addition comes after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-keep">Google Keep</a> gained notable features last year. The note-taking app has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-found-testing-new-handwritten-notes-feature">gained support</a> for handwritten notes for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> that feature a stylus like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, S24 Ultra, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and select phones from Motorola as well.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Tuesday morning, several Slack users were reportedly experiencing issues in connecting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging platforms</a> and were having problems with loading the threads as well, according to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://slack-status.com/2025-05/7b32241eb41a54aa">Slack Status page</a>.</p><p>The Slack team appears to have quickly acknowledged the problem and started its investigation, which suggested a backend database routing issue, which made the messaging platform’s features unusable for some. After just a few hours, the issue with the platform has been resolved.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="vV9NdbCcwE2yXzPNDPgTUC" name="slack-new-interface-tooltip.jpg" alt="Slack" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vV9NdbCcwE2yXzPNDPgTUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Slack status page has further indicated that users experiencing problems in sending messages, loading channels, threads, canvases, Activity, and client details — will now see them working as the support team assures improvements being seen.</p><p>The last update from the status page indicates that everything was fixed by <strong>Tuesday (May 13) at 5:37 a.m. (GMT+5:30)</strong>. The Slack team has also apologized for the disruptions caused during the day. Since the issue appears to have been triggered early in the morning, not many users must have experienced the issue.</p><p>However, the latest outage is believed to be the second major outage of the year as one of them happened early this year, in February. It was also a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/slack-is-down-impacting-workplaces-across-the-globe">global outage</a>, which took down several workplace communications offline. The issues included trouble logging in, messaging, and other app features.</p>
<p>Slack was able to restore the full functionality to all affected features of the platform and suggested users to reload the application to get it up smooth and running after the fix. We recommend users to do the same this time as well, since a smaller percentage of users appear to have been affected with the issue this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, Slack has further assured that it is currently monitoring all health metrics and “working to resolve a small backlog of queued items.”</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Vivo is doing all the right things in 2025; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> continues to be one of the best camera phones of the year, and I'm excited to get my hands on the X200 Ultra and see how it measures up this year. In the meantime, the V50 is turning out to be a reliable mid-ranger with the best design in its category.</p><p>That shouldn't be surprising in the least, considering Vivo is making a habit of launching gorgeous phones in the V series. I thoroughly enjoyed using the V30 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v40-pro-review">V40 Pro</a>, and while there isn't a Pro model this time (it's likely coming later), the V50 retains the best features of its predecessors while getting a sizeable 6,000mAh silicon battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zSYetGx8xHW8sDx35RJbC5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSYetGx8xHW8sDx35RJbC5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5070" height="2856" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The V50 is available in select Southeast Asian countries, and in India, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/vivo-v50-5g-rose-red-128-gb/p/itm12bbdca230795">costs ₹34,999</a> ($413) for the standard 8GB/128GB model, ₹36,999 ($436) if you want 8GB/256GB, and ₹40,999 ($484) if you're looking to get the 12GB/512GB edition. It goes up against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> in the country, and Vivo is positioning the design and cameras as the key features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rho5RsyPMXzyzbJA5yKxR5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rho5RsyPMXzyzbJA5yKxR5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most is the design; phones have decidedly gotten boxier in recent years, and I'm not a fan of the trend. Thankfully, Vivo retained a thin design with smooth curves at the back, and it makes using the phone that much better. It has a glass back, but the polycarbonate mid-frame allowed Vivo to save weight, and although there's a 6000mAh battery, the phone comes in at a manageable 189g.</p>

<p>The sleeker profile definitely makes a difference in daily use, and the Red Rose color option I'm using is gorgeous — I still don't understand why brands reserve the best colors for their mid-range phones and not flagships. The frosted glass finish at the back accentuates the color, and the design of the camera island is better this time around; you still get a sizeable module, but it doesn't look anywhere as busy as the V40.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qB5x59kAAtDFY4W7MmzSQ5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qB5x59kAAtDFY4W7MmzSQ5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has color-matched sides, and while that's undeniably good, the glossy finish detracts from the otherwise-great in-hand feel. The only other issue with the design is that the in-screen module is located a little too low, and it makes accessing it a bit awkward. That said, Vivo did a great job with ingress protection; the phone gets the standard IP68 dust and water resistance, and it even picks up IP69, allowing it to withstand jets of water.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MtHhcK73wmxMhifo6knEP5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MtHhcK73wmxMhifo6knEP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo went with a slightly smaller 6.77-inch AMOLED panel on the V50, and the resolution is down to FHD+ (2392 x 1080). However, there isn't any noticeable difference in regular use between the device and the V40, and it gets just as bright. It's set to 60Hz out of the box, but you can easily switch to 120Hz via the settings, and I didn't notice any lag in day-to-day tasks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7JA7UbJhseNHrXCnXCmfH5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7JA7UbJhseNHrXCnXCmfH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has good color vibrancy and contrast levels, and there's a decent amount of customizability when it comes to adjusting the colors. Another positive is that the phone gets stereo sound — much like the V40, and it makes using the onboard sound that much better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PrzjXzjg5d4YfVdjRW3HN5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PrzjXzjg5d4YfVdjRW3HN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn't anything new to talk about the performance, as the V50 is using the same Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 silicon as the V40 and the V30. I would have liked to see the 7s Gen 3 as it holds up a little better, and while the device is still good, it doesn't quite have the power needed to run demanding games at high settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ej5FXXS3iXfYCYZAU7xQM5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ej5FXXS3iXfYCYZAU7xQM5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, there isn't an issue with overheating, and outside of gaming, I didn't see any lag or slowdowns with the V50. The base 8GB/128GB is a bit limited in my view, and I'd suggest getting the 8GB/256GB option instead. Connectivity is pretty good too, and I didn't have problems making calls or connecting to my home network.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="QTEMjSFbsdhXo2599cYZU5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QTEMjSFbsdhXo2599cYZU5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With Vivo continuing with a biannual release cadence, there isn't much that's different with the cameras on the V50. It has two 50MP lenses at the back, and while the main camera uses a slightly bigger module, I didn't see any difference in image quality. The phone continues to do a great job with portrait shots, and it is still one of the best mid-rangers in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="P7sPJMD7pTPbRiSCnXMJS5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P7sPJMD7pTPbRiSCnXMJS5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life is where I noticed the biggest difference, with the V50 having much better headroom thanks to a 6,000mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon carbon battery</a>. The phone manages to last a day and a half comfortably between charges, and even with heavy use, there are no issues getting to the end of the day. It's a similar story with charging tech; with 90W USB PD as standard, it takes under 50 minutes to charge the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="u59CehXYBdQrDnZzCGTkL5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u59CehXYBdQrDnZzCGTkL5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo is doing good things with software as well, and I like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based Funtouch OS 15. The interface is fluid, there's extensive customizability, and I didn't see any issues with notifications or aggressive memory management. The only point to note in this regard is that the V50 will get three Android OS updates — one less than its immediate rivals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ApwdmzxQdMFwYn6sLEiyQ5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ApwdmzxQdMFwYn6sLEiyQ5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the V50 doesn't really bring much new to the table, and that's okay. Vivo didn't need to alter the fundamentals too much, and by adding a bigger battery and refreshing the design, the brand delivered a device that's slightly better than its predecessor. If you need a camera-focused mid-ranger with a stylish design, the V50 is a great choice.</p>

<hr>
<p>It is that time of the year where Sony usually launches its flagship Xperia series, and the company has one this year, the Xperia 1 VII, which has just gone official.</p><p>Like conventional flagships from Sony, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> also emphasizes camera, display, battery, with better sound quality taking the spot this year. Like its predecessor, the Xperia 1 VII comes with familiar specs that include the full 52MP (48MP effective) primary lens, another 50MP (48MP) secondary lens, and a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens. The front also equips a 12MP selfie shooter. The rear cameras are also ZEISS and signature Sony Alpha-powered, which has been the case for the past couple of generations of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sony-phones">Xperia handsets</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yhohesFirrUMfuk5pPgpdg" name="sony-xperia-1-vii-01" alt="Sony Xperia 1 VII" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yhohesFirrUMfuk5pPgpdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design, on the other hand, also appears familiar to the previous iteration; however, color options are limited to Moss Green, Orchid Purple, and State Black. The screen is a BRAVIA-powered 6.5 inch panel — a taller display with 19.5:9 ratio, Full HD+ resolution, and 120Hz refresh rates. The build quality includes Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and regular Victus for the back. Additionally, users can also experience IPX5/IPX8 water and IP6X dust resistance.</p><p>The Sony flagship is shipping with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> with a promise of four-year operating system upgrades and six years of security updates. It is powered by Qualcomm’s latest and greatest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> coupled with 12GB of RAM and 256GB onboard storage, further includes support for expandable storage with up to 2TB micro SD. While the latter is pretty rare these days on any Android phone, another decent inclusion is the 3.5mm headphone jack that is still intact on the Xperia 1 VII.</p>

<p>Other notable features of the flagship include a 5000mAh battery capacity with support for Qi wireless charging and a promise of two-day battery life through a single charge. A high-quality sound with Sony’s proprietary WALKMAN DNA technology, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, and a vapor chamber cooler for a more hassle-free gaming experience.</p><p>The Xperia 1 VII is up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.co.uk/smartphones/products/xperia-1m7?sku=xqfs54eukcg.gc#overview">preorder</a> in the U.K., retailing at £1,399 for the sole 256GB variant, which is slightly higher than Samsung’s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which is priced at £1,099 for the same storage variant.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung finally took the wraps off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, debuting the thinnest smartphone the company has made to date. It's got a stunning 6.7-inch AMOLED screen, a 200MP main camera on the back alongside a 12MP ultrawide camera, Corning Gorilla Armor 2 protection all around, and the top-notch Snapdragon 8 Elite processing package inside for true flagship-tier performance.</p><p>And while it comes in an unbelievably thin 5.8mm frame and the incomparable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> powering the experience, it has one major setback that's going to drive most of its users crazy: a tiny battery and relatively slow charging.</p><p>You see, while Samsung's software experience is truly superb and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> is more feature-rich than any other company's AI offerings right now, Samsung's hardware team is still using outdated battery and charging tech. While it could offset this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-are-we-obsessed-with-charging-speeds">with faster charging tech</a>, the company has shown that it's not willing to keep up with the Joneses in this regard, either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-vs-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-thickness-1" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, companies like Honor and OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">are using silicon-carbon batteries</a> in their phones and have been for years, in Honor's case. Using a silicon carbon anode allows these companies to make denser batteries that are able to withstand extreme temperatures, last longer, and charge faster than the regular Li-Ion batteries Samsung uses.</p><p>Using a silicon-carbon anode negates the swelling that could otherwise occur with pure silicon batteries — something Samsung never wants to have happen after the Galaxy Note 7 — and makes it possible to increase the battery's density by around 13%. That means Samsung could have put a 4,400mAh battery inside the Galaxy S25 Edge if it used silicon carbon, whereas the Li-Ion battery inside the phone is only 3,900mAh.</p><p>Considering most modern Android phones sport batteries between 5,000mAh and 6,000mAh in capacity, battery life on the S25 Edge is all but guaranteed to be sub-par. Samsung confirmed to Android Central that the Galaxy S25 Edge's battery is made of the same materials as the rest of the S25 lineup. To be fair to Samsung, this battery is <em>only </em>100mAh smaller than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, and while battery life isn't horrible on that phone, it isn't excellent, either.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>A small battery is already a challenge, but 25W charging from 2020 makes it even worse.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>Samsung could offset the small battery with ultra-fast charging, but the company doesn't seem to want to push that envelope, either. Instead, the S25 Edge maxes out at 25W. That's nearly 1/3 of what Honor offers on the 4.4mm thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor V3</a>, for example, meaning there's no chance to get a quick top-up if you run out of juice halfway through the day.</p><p>To make a truly successful ultra-thin flagship phone, a company has to conquer four main pillars: processing power and thermals, camera quality, battery life, and charging speed. Samsung seems to have nailed the first two thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, a thinner and broader heat chamber, and a 200MP main camera, but I have serious doubts about the remaining two requirements.</p><p>If nearly any other Android manufacturer made this phone — Vivo, Xiaomi, Honor, OnePlus, or Motorola — I think they could have nailed all four and called it a day. But Samsung's fear of battery technology and charging speeds is, once again, hamstringing the potential greatness of its latest flagship, and that's the real shame of it all.</p>

<p>If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> was too bulky for your taste, the S25 Edge might be the perfect solution, weighing just 163 grams and measuring to 5.8mm of thickness. For a little perspective, that's a full 2.4mm thinner than the S25 Ultra and 2.7mm thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a>. The nice part is that this ultra-thin design doesn't come at the expense of most other specs. You still get a gorgeous 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a durable titanium-and-Gorilla Glass construction, while under the hood you'll enjoy the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Of course, a phone's battery is generally the component that contributes the most to weight and thickness, which means the Edge has the smallest battery of any phone in the S25 lineup. Samsung is still claiming that the S25 Edge will last all day on a single charge, but I'll believe it when I see it. Aside from that, though, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge seems destined to be one of the best-looking and sleekest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> released this year, and thanks to this preorder deal, it might end up being pretty darn cheap too.</p>

We’ve been waiting for the latest addition to the Galaxy S25 family for months, especially as we didn’t have much information about the key feature: its thickness.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 lineup</a> was already slimmer than its predecessors, but the Galaxy S25 Edge takes this to a whole new level. It measures just 5.8mm thick, making it one of the thinnest phones ever made and by far, the thinnest phone you can buy right now (at least until Apple launches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-17-air-5-key-rumored-features-from-an-ultra-thin-frame-to-so-so-battery-life">rumored iPhone 17 Air</a> later this year).</p><p>However, beyond the extremely thin profile, the Galaxy S25 Edge combines key parts of the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra to make a phone that feels familiar, yet unique.</p><p>I spent an hour with the Galaxy S25 Edge in New York City earlier today, and I was surprised at how much I like it. Here’s our first full look at Samsung’s new thin-and-mighty smartphone.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge won’t appeal to everyone. It lacks the full camera prowess of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and the battery is the smallest of the lineup, but these sacrifices come with a key benefit: its thickness and weight.</p><p>If you’ve been put off by the size or weight of the Galaxy S25 lineup, the Galaxy S25 Edge is the phone for you. At just 5.8mm thick, it's 2.4mm thinner than the Galaxy S25 Ultra and 1.4-1.5mm thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> and S25 Plus.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-vs-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-thickness-1" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy S25 Edge (right) lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra (left). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I love the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it’s incredibly hefty, and the Galaxy S25 Edge fixes the key issues. Despite the large display and mighty main camera, it also weighs just 163g, one gram heavier than the smaller base Galaxy S25. As for the competition, the iPhone 16 Pro is 8.3mm thick, while the Pixel 9 Pro is 8.5mm. Both weigh 199 grams, making the Galaxy S25 much thinner and lighter than these devices.</p><p>Like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Galaxy S25 Edge features a titanium frame paired with Gorilla Glass protection on either side. The rear features Gorilla Glass Victus protection, while the front uses Corning’s new Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2. It features the same protection as the Gorilla Glass Ceramic used on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but lacks the anti-reflective finish.</p>

<p>There are other subtle differences compared to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, with the sharp edges far more nuanced and much nicer in the hand. This subtle design change, combined with the thin and light build, means the Galaxy S25 Edge feels nicer in the hand than any of its siblings.</p>
<h2 id="flagship-specs-borrowed-from-the-s25-lineup-2">Flagship specs borrowed from the S25 lineup</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is designed to offer the best features of the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup in a slim and light device. It pairs the 6.7-inch display from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> with the same 200MP primary camera found on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The display features the same 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate and vision booster to boost the brightness, and looks just as great as the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup.</p><p>The 200MP camera is a key addition that ensures it still feels like a flagship phone, especially given its price. The camera has the same capabilities and features as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, although the lack of a telephoto means it likely won’t be as capable at longer focal lengths.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-3" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge camera sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung says the camera can offer 2x optical zoom, which is likely achieved through in-sensor cropping. It also uses pixel binning to combine nine pixels into one larger pixel, which allows it to capture more light. The main camera is paired with a 12MP ultra-wide camera, while the front camera is also a 12MP sensor, but much wider than the one used in the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor as the rest of its siblings. It is paired with 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage, and if you pre-order in the US, you’ll get the latter at no additional cost.</p>
<h2 id="the-biggest-challenge-is-likely-to-be-battery-life-2">The biggest challenge is likely to be battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jMjYdkCgRTCumFkvKjXSgi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-27" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jMjYdkCgRTCumFkvKjXSgi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is quite smart as it combines the best of the Galaxy S25 family into a new phone, but there’s one thing Samsung couldn’t get around: the laws of physics. In particular, the extremely thin profile means a smaller battery, and the smallest battery in the Galaxy S25 lineup.</p><p>It features a 3,900 mAh battery paired with 25W wired charging. The battery is the smallest of a Samsung flagship in many years, and the charging is on par with the base Galaxy S25. However, it lacks the faster 45W charging support found on the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra.</p><p>Samsung says the battery delivers all-day battery life, but this is an area that we’ll need to test much further. Diving further into the battery life, Samsung says it’s better than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> and almost as good as the base Galaxy S25, which leads me to believe that it may not last a full day under moderate to heavy usage. However, as a colleague remarked, the thin profile and light build make it worth the need for a recharge during the day.</p>
<h2 id="i-like-the-galaxy-s25-edge-far-more-than-i-expected-2">I like the Galaxy S25 Edge far more than I expected</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-8" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is now available for preorder and will hit stores on May 30. It comes in three colors — Titanium Jet Black, Titanium Icy Blue, and Titanium Silver — and costs $1,099.99 for 256GB of storage. It’s essentially $100 more than the Galaxy S25 Plus, and $200 less than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, although the best Galaxy S25 Edge pre-order deals could save you a considerable amount.</p><p>I don’t have a particular preference for ultra-thin phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">unlike some at Android Central</a>, but there’s no denying that the Galaxy S25 Ultra adds considerable weight to your pocket. The Galaxy S25 Edge shows you can have the best of both worlds, although the lack of a telephoto lens may prove disappointing in the long run. The battery is my primary concern, but time will tell whether it can last a full day as Samsung claims.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-13" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite these likely challenges, I’m surprised at how much I enjoyed the Galaxy S25 Edge in my short time with it. You may not think it, but the thin profile greatly affects how it feels in the hand. Despite being supremely thin, it still feels premium thanks to the titanium frame, and it isn’t as fragile as I had expected.</p><p>If you’ve been holding off on buying a Galaxy S25 series phone due to its weight or size, the Galaxy S25 Edge is worth checking out. The thin profile necessitates some compromises, but look beyond these, and you’ll find a phone that feels fantastic in the hand. Seeing is believing, and you might be surprised at how much you enjoy it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's "beyond slim" device has finally arrived.</p><p>The company, in a virtual Unpacked event, unveiled the slim fourth variant of the Galaxy S25 series: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. According to Samsung, this phone "strikes a new balance of premium, pro-level performance," and is crafted with both style and strength in mind.</p><p>While the phone's design has been shown off several times since its announcement, we weren't allowed to get up close to it, and Samsung had been pretty tight-lipped about it. Nevertheless, several leaks have provided a somewhat solid glimpse of what to expect from this "ultra-slim" device</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.67%;"><img id="cs3itcZXFjb52ZAa4LnPgb" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-thinness" alt="A GIF of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cs3itcZXFjb52ZAa4LnPgb.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="352" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting with the phone's design, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has a durable titanium frame with rounded corners, which boasts a slender 5.8mm profile and weighs 163g. Despite its sleek design, the screen is protected by the latest Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, giving the device additional resiliency.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge comes with a 6.7-inch QHD+  Dynamic AMOLED display that offers smooth responsiveness with its 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. The display is enhanced by a vision booster and adaptive color tone for optimal viewing in any environment.</p><p>At its core, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset </a>for Galaxy, much like the rest of the variants in this lineup. This chip will help with the advanced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI </a>features, which this phone is said to come with, including Galaxy AI-powered editing features, like<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25"> Audio Eraser</a> and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-ai-drawing-assist-samsung-galaxy-s25"> Drawing Assist</a>.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge will feature a vertical, dual rear camera setup. Its primary 200MP wide-angle lens has optical image stabilization and an F/1.7 aperture to help capture 40% brighter images in low-light settings.</p><p>This lens also offers 2X zoom, but can go up to 10X digital zoom with the help of AI. The other lens is a 12MP ultrawide camera with an F/2.2 aperture, allowing users to capture more elements in their photos. As for its selfie camera, the device is equipped with a 12MP lens.</p><p>Furthermore, the device will come with Android 15 out of the box, along with Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, just like the other Galaxy S25 phones. The Galaxy S25 Edge also gets all the quirks of the OS, including features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a>, which now showcase third-party app integrations helping users keep up with their day-to-day tasks.</p>

<p>Despite its impressive specs, the Galaxy S25 Edge will feature a relatively compact 3,900mAh battery, suggesting that the Korean OEM traded off battery capacity to maintain the device's thin profile. The phone can reach up to 55% charge within 30 minutes, using the 25W wired adapter, and is also compatible with Qi2 wireless charging.</p><p>Additionally, the sleek phone gets an IP68 dust and water resistance certification, which gives the device comprehensive protection from dust.</p><p>As expected, the Galaxy S25 Edge also gets access Gemini's latest features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini Live camera and screen sharing</a> capabilities. The phone will also feature Galaxy Samsung Wallet’s soon-to-be-released<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-tap-to-transfer-is-finally-landing-on-us-galaxy-phones-this-month"> Tap to Transfer feature</a>, that makes sending money as easy as a phone bump.</p>

Leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZionsAnvin/status/1921758366377857110" target="_blank">Anvin on X</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_magic_v5_to_come_soon_with_huge_battery_increase-news-67731.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>) spotted what looks like a monster 5,950mAh battery in the paperwork.</p>

<p>The setup presumably uses a dual-cell design—2,070mAh and 3,880mAh—which adds up to 6,000mAh. That’s probably the number Honor will run with when the phone hits store shelves.</p><p>Whether Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v4-specs-have-leaked-and-the-oppo-find-n5-should-be-scared">plans to reduce the thickness even more with the Magic V5 is still up in the air</a>. Lately, phone makers have been all about going ultra-thin. But Honor has already made waves with the Magic V3, which measured only 9.2mm when folded.</p><p>Despite its super slim build, the Magic V3 still packed a surprisingly solid battery that held its own. For the record, it launched back in July last year with a total battery capacity of 5,150mAh.</p>

<p>While the Magic V5 may get a bigger battery, don’t expect faster charging to go with it. The regulatory listings show it’ll stick with 66W charging, which is the same as the Magic V3.</p><p>Honor hasn’t locked in a name yet. It could be called the Magic V4 or Magic V5. But there’s a good chance the company will skip “V4,” since the number 4 is often avoided in Chinese culture.</p><p>The Magic V5 is likely landing this July, just like the V2 and V3 before it. Both of those also got their global spotlight at IFA Berlin, so odds are Honor is sticking with that same rollout plan. That said, we wouldn’t rule out an earlier sneak peek either.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube is shaking up the Subscriptions page in an update announced last month and rolling out now.</li><li>The page will now place Shorts at the top of the viewable area, requiring users to scroll to see traditional long-form content.</li><li>This tweak is rolling out for YouTube app users on TVs and consoles, including Apple and Google TV hardware.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is rolling out a change to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-to-use-machine-learning-to-figure-out-whos-lying-about-their-age">app for TVs and consoles</a> that prioritizes Shorts content over your subscriptions. The tweak, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/341112828?hl=en" target="_blank">announced</a> last month, shakes up the Subscriptions tab on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube app for TVs</a>.</p><p>It separates YouTube Shorts from long-form videos, placing Shorts at the very top of your subscriptions tab. This change is widely rolling out for TVs and consoles, including Google TV and Apple TV hardware, as reported by Reddit users and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/12/youtube-app-tv-shorts-subscriptions-feed/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-shorts-new-editor-ai-stickers-spring-rollout">Shorts</a> row on the Subscriptions page still only shows videos from channels and creators you're subscribed to. However, the vertical length of Shorts previews means that long-form YouTube videos aren't fully visible on the Subscriptions page anymore without scrolling.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4rvGTxMsS49FDoKPuokm29" name="YouTube-Shorts-TV-app-redesign" alt="The YouTube Shorts section atop the YouTube TV subscription feed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rvGTxMsS49FDoKPuokm29.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Previously, Shorts were mixed in with a user's main subscriptions feed. The new update adds separation for YouTube's vertical, short-form content and the platform's traditional horizontal, long-form content. For some, it will come at the expense of usability, as users now have to scroll to see their traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> subscription row on the Subscriptions page.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1kgvdh7/appletv_youtube_app_what_the_actual_duck">AppleTV Youtube app & What the actual duck ???</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube">r/youtube</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>In the first few days following the new Subscriptions page's rollout, some users are already unhappy with the shift. One user on Reddit, u/AtlasMMX, pointed out the oddness of being unable to see their long-form subscription row on a 77-inch flatscreen TV. They particularly criticize the wasted space atop the Subscriptions page, which theoretically could be used to put Shorts and long-form content on the same viewable area.</p><p>It's just one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/search/?q=shorts+tv&type=posts&sort=new&cId=bfb2f6c7-9dd3-4f0e-8a2f-c51c8cb92e98&iId=aaa16093-c783-42e3-a1ab-bc604702847b" target="_blank">many Reddit posts</a> on the YouTube subreddit criticizing the move across platforms, including Google TV and Apple TV. Unfortunately, there's no way for YouTube users on TVs and consoles to rearrange the order of their Subscriptions page.</p>

<p><strong>T asks:</strong></p><p><em><strong>Why do companies build phones that are never for sale in all countries? I've seen several phones I would like to buy if they were available here.</strong></em></p><p><strong>And several people have been more specific:</strong><em><strong> </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>When will the </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a56-could-launch-soon" target="_blank"><em><strong>Samsung Galaxy A56</strong></em></a><em><strong> come to the U.S.? </strong></em></p>
<p>Thanks for the question(s), guys and gals; this is another really good one with an interesting answer, and those are my favorite ones!</p><p>I'll answer the second part first because it's easier and a lot simpler: only Samsung knows. OK, well, maybe company execs at Verizon know, too, but you get what I mean. Samsung suggested that the phone will launch in the U.S. market, but never said anything more specific than "later in 2025," and that doesn't mean much. It might never come, because of the overall answer of why phones are sold in specific places.</p><p>I'm not suggesting that Samsung is lying or anything. The A56 may show up for sale tomorrow, but it may not; it all depends on Samsung's thoughts of its place in the market. That's a big part of the whole picture.</p>

<p>At the root of it all is (you guessed it) money. A company like Samsung wants every model it makes to be a hit, selling millions of units. Many of them are universal — minor hardware differences aside, you can buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> almost anywhere. Things get a little murkier from there. There has to be a market for a phone to sell.</p><p>With so many different phones to choose from, it can be hard to build something that's best in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">specific price range</a>, size, or any other metric you can think of. A company also has to compete with itself sometimes — you might not buy a base model S25 if you can get the A56 a little cheaper.</p><p>Ideally, Samsung wants both the S25 and A56 to sell like hotcakes. The company has gigantic marketing teams who get into the science of figuring out the consumer smartphone market so that the right phones are released at the right time to the right places.</p>

<p>A company that makes phones only does it for one reason: to sell them and make a profit. No matter if it's a huge company like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-so-far-ahead-its-display-game">Samsung</a> or a small company like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-is-doing-its-part-to-make-the-world-a-better-place-is-it-enough">Fairphone</a>, the idea is to build and sell products like every other business that's not a bonafide charity.</p><p>Sometimes there's a quasi-technical reason. Phones designed for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-whats-an-international-phone-and-do-i-need-one">use in different countries</a> may need specific hardware and software inside so they work on the available networks. Building different models, then testing those models, and getting regulatory approval to sell them costs money. If a company doesn't think it can sell enough to make a profit, it may not release it in certain markets.</p><p>Additionally, patents and royalties can come into play and restrict where a phone can be sold. Thankfully, that's mostly a thing of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Pure speculation</strong>: With the Galaxy S25 being new, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/latest-galaxy-s25-edge-leak-confirms-200mp-primary-camera-and-a-solid-build">S25 edge due any minute now</a>, and a (hopefully) well-priced new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip</a> on the horizon, now is <em>not</em> the time to release a $500 Galaxy A56 in the company's biggest consumer market.</p><p>That doesn't mean there won't be a right time later; companies like Google (and probably Apple) will show off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">a budget model</a> later in the year, and that could be the time for Samsung to jump in with its own.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3752px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="bztYQAA8FhXFmaDC2ErWjA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-side-by-side" alt="The Porcelain, Iris, Peony, and Obsidian Google Pixel 9a stood upright against a wall showing art of a man using a Google device." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bztYQAA8FhXFmaDC2ErWjA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3752" height="2109" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Or maybe the company will change its mind completely and never sell it in the U.S. The one thing we can be sure of is that Samsung spends a lot of time and money to find the answers because that's part of its business. A lot of companies make great products, but very few can move the numbers that Samsung does.</p>
<p>If I were looking for a new phone right now, I'd keep an open mind and check out every company's website to see what they're talking about. If it looks like exactly what I needed was right around the corner, I would wait a little bit, but if not, I would decide based on what's available right now that fits my needs and budget.</p>

<h2 id="these-are-the-best-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-screen-protectors-2">These are the best Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 screen protectors</h2>
<p>Motorola does not recommend peeling off the factory-installed screen protector, especially the one on the inside. These are glad tidings as there are no 7-inch Razr Ultra 2025 screen protectors available to purchase for now. First and third-party options are sure to launch in the coming weeks. In the meantime, focus on the external cover display instead as that's always exposed and therefore more vulnerable anyway.</p><p>There are a handful of front screen protectors for the 4-inch front display of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 for sale right now. Happily, this includes both tempered glass and flexible plastic film options. On top of that, you can get privacy screen guards in both materials too.</p><p>The MOOISVS 2+2packs Screen Protector Moto Razr Ultra 2025 is the best overall choice when looking for a robust shatter-proof tempered glass front screen protector set. The kit includes two units of the front screen protector as well as two more units of camera lens protectors. However, the lens screen guards don't offer full coverage.</p><p>If you're worried about the lenses, I recommend the Zeking 2 Set Motorola Razr 60 Ultra Camera Lens Protector. It includes two pieces of durable tempered glass camera lens protectors with metal rims reinforcing the impact resistance. Plus, you can color match the metal rim to the shade of your Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 or your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-cases">Razr Ultra 2025's phone case</a>.</p>

<h2 id="high-quality-screen-protectors-elongate-your-motorola-razr-plus-2025-s-lifespan-2">High-quality screen protectors elongate your Motorola Razr Plus 2025's lifespan</h2>
<p>The best quality Motorola Razr Plus 2025 screen protectors prevent scratches, cracks, and shatters on both screens, thereby extending its lifespan. It also helps to have a mint condition phone when you trade it in later on for a newer release. With that being said, here are the top picks you should consider.</p><p>Our best overall selection is the highly-rated Ruiheshiyi Motorola Razr Plus 2024 2025 Screen Protector 2 Pack. It's priced below $20, making it fairly reasonable and you get a lot of value for your money. The set includes two pieces of screen protectors as well as an assistive installation frame in the box. So even if you install it by yourself at home, you will achieve a clean result without running the risk of ruining the spare. The external screen protector is made of sturdy 9H tempered glass whereas the internal film is made of a robust TPU material.</p><p>If you don't like the glossy finish of glass or plastic films, Diacube sells a matte screen protector three-pack that's just nice. It costs almost the same as our first choice, but you get three screen protectors instead of two each for both displays. Although this three-pack is made for the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 — also known as the Motorola Razr 50 Ultra in some markets — it fits the Motorola Razr Plus 2025. As explained earlier in the article, both models share the same screen dimensions to make this possible.</p><p>Now that you've settled on a screen protector, consider purchasing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-motorola-razr-plus-2025-cases">case for your Motorola Razr Plus 2025</a> too. There are tons of excellent options available.</p>

For the first time, the Razr Ultra 2025 features a flagship processor, helping to make the smartphone a complete package.</p><p>However, Motorola is charging a pretty penny for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a>. It retails for $1,299, which is the same price as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and $200 more expensive than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is also more expensive than the highest-end Razr available last year.</p><p>That means, regardless of whether you're considering an upgrade from an existing foldable or are trying one for the first time, the high price of the latest Razr could be an obstacle. The good news is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025#section-motorola-razr-2025-specs-cameras">Razr Ultra 2025</a> is jam-packed with hardware upgrades and improvements. If you can look past the price hike, this is arguably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best clamshell foldable</a> on the market.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-from-an-older-razr-2">Should you upgrade to the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 from an older Razr?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is a solid buy for most Razr owners, as long as you don't have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. If you do have a last-generation flagship, the answer is a bit trickier. The newer model has a faster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</a>, a slightly larger 7-inch pOLED foldable display, and a bigger 4,700mAh battery. Those are tangible upgrades, with the improved battery life being the most likely to impact daily use.</p><p>With that being said, it still doesn't seem like enough to convince users to pay $1,299 for a Razr Ultra 2025, less than a year after paying $999 for a Razr Plus 2024. Even with trade-in deals or accessory promotions, the value simply isn't there. That's especially true when considering that the Razr Plus 2024 has a telephoto camera capable of 2x zoom, which some could consider a better option than the Razr Ultra 2025's ultrawide camera, although Android Central's Derrek Lee <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">thinks the ultrawide camera is the way to go</a>.</p><p>For those reasons, if you own a Razr Plus 2024, it isn't worthwhile to upgrade to a newer model so soon, no matter how tempting the upgrades might be.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gESYfYoXS2QaPatrbU5U2Y" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-closed-cover-screen-01" alt="Holding a Motorola Razr Plus 2024 while it's closed with the cover screen illuminated and unlocked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gESYfYoXS2QaPatrbU5U2Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Holding a Motorola Razr Plus 2024 while it's closed with the cover screen illuminated and unlocked. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there are too many similarities between the Razr Plus 2024 and the Razr Ultra 2025, that's not true of the other Razr models.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> feature the older clamshell design with smaller cover screens that aren't edge-to-edge. It might not jump out to you on the spec sheet, but the difference between the 3.6-inch pOLED cover screens on those models will feel a lot smaller than the 4-inch pOLED cover screen on the Razr Ultra 2025. That extra space makes using any app on the cover screen more manageable.</p><p>There's no question that the Razr Ultra 2025 will feel like a completely different device compared to even older models, like the Razr 2023, Razr 2022, and Razr 5G. It's worth the upgrade if you still enjoy the flip-style foldable form factor. Aside from all the aforementioned improvements, the latest model's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 16GB of RAM will help it thrive with intensive tasks, including everything from gaming to AI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-05" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The build quality improvements available on the Razr Ultra 2025 are hard to understate, too. The hinge is expected to feel smoother than older models, in part due to a new design with titanium reinforcements. The smartphone also has an IP48 water an dust-resistance rating, and stronger Gorilla Glass Ceramic covering the outer screen.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-cover-screen" alt="YouTube Music on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola already had an edge on Samsung's foldables, since it offers an unrestricted cover screen experience. Meanwhile, the smaller cover screen on even the latest Galaxy Z Flip models can't be fully taken advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">without using Good Lock</a>. If you own the newest Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Motorola Razr Ultra might be worth the upgrade.</p><p>There are a few key things to consider before you take the leap from a Samsung to a Motorola foldable, though. For starters, remember that Samsung is gearing up to launch a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> in just a few months. It might be tempting to look at the Razr Ultra 2025's chip upgrade as a reason to switch sides, but the next Galaxy foldable could have a similar improvement.</p><p>More importantly, know that the software support experience on the Razr Ultra 2025 will be wildly different from the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and older models. Motorola has notoriously poor software support, with Android OS upgrades taking a long time to become available, and experiencing major bugs after the fact. You're only guaranteed three Android OS upgrades if you buy a Razr Ultra 2025, compared to seven on the current Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9vaER3KiFVQ4ztkTpo7gag" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Gemini-cover-screen.jpg" alt="Gemini on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9vaER3KiFVQ4ztkTpo7gag.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung notably didn't have the best time rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> to Galaxy Z Flip 6 owners, but it does still have a solid track record for software support. Plus, Galaxy foldables generally offer a more polished experience than Motorola foldables — even if the latter can be more useful and customizable.</p><p>Those that are disenfranchised with Galaxy Z Flip devices might enjoy the upgrade to the Razr Ultra 2025, but the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Generally weaker cameras and worse software support are real cons to switching from a Galaxy foldable. But the bigger, unrestricted cover screen and powerful hardware could be enough to overlook all that and pick up a Razr Ultra.</p>

<p>Finally, if you're in the market for a new foldable, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is an excellent place to start. It's expensive, sure, but not by a massive margin compared to flagships like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. With a truly flagship-caliber processor and a Motorola software experience that's quite similar to stock Android, the transition from a traditional smartphone to a Razr Ultra 2025 should be smooth.</p><p>It's also a neat upgrade from older Razr or Galaxy foldables, as the form factor really does get more durable and polished every year. However, foldable progress is slowing down a bit, so year-to-year upgrades aren't as impressive. Waiting a few years between foldable upgrades is certainly the right call, and those still rocking a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review">Galaxy Z Flip 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2023">Razr Plus 2023</a> or older are sure to feel the Razr Ultra 2025's improvements in a big way.</p><p>But beyond the Razr Ultra, Motorola also launched two cheaper Razr models for 2025, and we've quickly broken down each device to help you determine <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">which Razr 2025 model you should buy</a>.</p>

<p>Google detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/how-were-using-ai-to-combat-the-latest-scams/">Keyword</a> post how it is currently keeping new online scams at bay with the help of Gemini. It released a report on how the tech giant has been working on detecting scams on Search, Chrome, and Android.</p><p>To start, the company says it has used Gemini's algorithms will quickly identify scammers' patterns and linguistic cues that are indicative of fraudulent activity, considering that scammers keep switching around their techniques, and don't stick to one pattern to get into people's online accounts and sensitive data.</p><p>Google says it's using Gemini to stay one step ahead of them: "Large language models have also helped us to scale our protections across languages to protect more people around the world," Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/Search-Scam-Report-0508.pdf">report</a> stated.</p><p>With these improvements, the tech giant says it's been able to sieve through vast quantities of text on the web, identify coordinated scam campaigns, and detect emerging threats on Search.</p>

<p>For instance, Google says it was able to reduce fake airline customer service scams by 80% this past year on Search. Making it less likely for users to accidentally call a scam airline number.</p><p>Additionally, even though it spotted a rise in misleading pages mimicking official visa or government services, the new AI protection "decreased scams impersonating official sites by more than 70%," the company added.</p><p>As for Chrome, even though its "Enhanced Protection" setting detects and takes down spam websites, Google says that Chrome is using Gemini Nano, directly on the computer, to make this protection even better.</p><p>Gemini Nano's algorithm is trained to spot dangerous websites instantly, even when the scams are new. Gemini Nano's LLM is good at understanding how scam websites look, which helps Chrome keep up with new tricks.</p><p>"We're already using this new AI-powered approach to protect users from remote tech support scams, one of the biggest online threats facing users today."</p><p>Google says it will train Gemini to spot a wide range of scams in the future.</p>

<p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a> announced and hitting shelves shortly, Motorola has been using edge-to-edge cover screens on clamshell foldables for two generations now. To date, Samsung has moved incredibly slowly in growing the cover screen of its Galaxy Z Flip competitor. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 both had a cover screen with a cutout for the rear camera lenses, but that might be finally changing with the Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will sport an edge-to-edge cover screen that wraps around the rear camera lenses for additional space, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-design-leak-apk-teardown-3556568/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. The publication dissected leaked One UI 8 firmware and uncovered animation files for Galaxy Z Flip models, including the unannounced Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><p>These animation files reveal tidbits about each model's design differences, as they're custom to the model they represent. For instance, the render for the Galaxy Z Flip 5 shows the pill-shaped rear camera housing and folder-style cover screen. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> animation file, on the other hand, shows the split rear camera lens arrangement and the same cover screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2982px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:23.00%;"><img id="GNZdmC6ebNaratfRQkcAoA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Leaked-Icons" alt="The prior two generations of Z Flip icons beside the new Z Flip 7 icon." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNZdmC6ebNaratfRQkcAoA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2982" height="686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, there's the leaked animation file for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, which clearly shows an expanded cover screen that extends all the way to the hinge and wraps around the rear cameras. This is a good of a sign as any that Samsung indeed plans to equip its next flip-style foldable with a new cover screen, matching the capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> and Razr Ultra 2025.</p><p>While the exact specifications of the new display are unclear, we can expect a cover screen measuring roughly four inches in size to debut on the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Aside from these leaked animation files, a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-leak" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> was revised earlier this month to also state that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will get a larger cover screen.</p><p>Paired with the leaked animation files, which come straight from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/someone-with-a-galaxy-s25-ended-up-getting-an-alleged-one-ui-8-update">One UI 8 firmware</a>, it seems safe to expect the next Samsung clamshell foldable to feature a fresh cover screen.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<ul><li>A Nemko Platform listing has reportedly picked up Samsung's next FE series earbuds, which will reportedly go by the "Galaxy Buds Core."</li><li>Little information is known about them, other than the inclusion of a 500mAh battery charging case and 200mAh batteries for the buds.</li><li>The Galaxy Buds 3 series launched last summer with a radical design shift that makes them feel more like Apple's AirPods.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's next FE earbuds are supposedly on the way, and with a few changes beyond their name.</p><p>A discovery by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-core-bis-battery-details/">91Mobiles</a> via the Nemko Platform database suggests that a device with model number SM-R410<strong> </strong>is the next Galaxy Buds FE (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-buds-core-battery-capacity-3556632/">Android Authority</a>). Interestingly, the listing states the device will be called the "Galaxy Buds Core," which echoes a previous Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-2-buds-core-fcc/">FCC listing</a> found by the publication. According to Nemko, the earbuds' charging case was found with model number "EP-QR410."</p><p>The listing suggests the case could provide a 500mAh battery for charging bursts while on the go.</p><p>Moreover, the earbuds themselves could pack a 200mAh battery for music, calls, and more. Other listed information isn't too surprising, but it states the buds will carry Bluetooth connectivity, as usual. The publication reiterates its FCC findings, adding the device is expected to see Bluetooth 5.0 Plus support, as well as "dual-band Wi-Fi, up to 5.8GHz."</p>

<p>In 2023, Samsung launched several devices under its Galaxy FE umbrella, and one of those products was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-launch">Galaxy Buds FE</a>. These earbuds were based on the Galaxy Buds, but were seen more as a successor. The Buds FE offer immersive audio quality, three mics on each bud, Active Noise Cancellation, and Ambient Sound. Additionally, Samsung outfitted the device with 8.5 hours of playback, which jumped to 30 hours if you had your case on hand.</p><p>This is where things get interesting because the Galaxy Buds FE featured an "ergonomic" design like the Galaxy Buds. This was produced via its bulbous, wing-tip design.</p><p>If Samsung is truly looking at a return to the Galaxy Buds FE, and calling it the "Galaxy Buds Core," we might have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">an idea about its design</a>. Typically, Samsung's FE devices play off the design of the flagship version, and we have the Galaxy Buds 3 series to look at. Those offered a more radical design change, looking more like Apple AirPods with a long stem.</p><p>The company said the change "enables a more intuitive physical experience by allowing you to control the device by simply pinching or swiping up or down on the blade" for controls. However, there's also a chance Samsung will resurrect that old wing-tip design to differentiate the "Galaxy Buds Core" from its flagship models.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

Then Lenovo did something unexpected when announcing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo/lenovo-legion-tab-fourth-gen-social-media-teasers">Y700 4th Gen</a> — it also introduced a dedicated controller. But this isn't like anything you've ever seen.</p><p>Instead of adding another expandable controller to a market that's already saturated, Lenovo introduced a dedicated "controller shell." Basically, you're able to remove the backplate, slot in the Y700, reattach the back, and be ready to go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XQZHtkBGo6MY3ixGjHAy4f" name="lenovo-y700-gen-4-press-render" alt="Lenovo Y700 Gen 4 Press Render (Translated)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XQZHtkBGo6MY3ixGjHAy4f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1520" height="855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo / Google Translate)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few reasons why this is so exciting, starting with the fact that it basically turns your tablet into an Android-powered Legion Go handheld. In case you weren't aware, the Lenovo Y700 2nd Gen actually uses the same screen as the original Legion Go that was released in 2023. And while I'm not 100% positive, I'm fairly certain it's the same screen that's found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/lenovo/lenovo-legion-go-s-review">Legion Go S</a> that was announced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovos-trio-of-new-tablets-have-something-for-everyone">CES 2025</a>.</p><p>After translating some of the material shared during the announcement, it appears that Lenovo is actually set to release two versions of the "Controller G9." Most of the features look to be the same for both, with at least one notable exception, as the G9 Pro features a different speaker system.</p>

This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablet</a> has become a darling in the emulation and gaming community, as the 2nd Gen has a compact design and a microSD card slot. The 3rd Gen fell off a bit in popularity, not because of its functionality, but mainly because Lenovo decided to ditch the expandable storage.</p><p>It seems that Lenovo is listening to the community, as the Y700 4th Gen brings back the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot. Plus, it's powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, which has been a mixed bag in terms of emulation but is still a powerhouse chip.</p>

<p>While it might seem counterintuitive to use a tablet inside a controller shell, to me, it just adds another layer of flexibility. Instead of trying to get the tablet to connect to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">external controller</a>, I can just pop it into the shell and start playing. But it comes with the added convenience of being a "regular" tablet when the situation suits me.</p><p>Lenovo has yet to confirm whether the Y700 4th Gen will actually make its way to this side of the world. For one, the Legion Tab was only just recently released, which is basically a Y700 Gen 3 with different branding. It will seem a bit odd if we see a new iteration, less than six months after the previous one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="CjCr5eNKxfhQwiNe3MDvFj" name="lenovo-legion-tab-2024-lifestyle-render.jpg" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab (2024) lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CjCr5eNKxfhQwiNe3MDvFj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other thing holding Lenovo back from bringing this to the States is the current economic and political climate. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/things-arent-looking-good-for-gaming-handhelds" target="_blank">back-and-forth tariff situation</a> between the U.S. and Chinese governments has been wreaking havoc on everything, not just electronics. Because of that, a number of companies raised prices, whether on devices or accessories.</p><p>With that in mind, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1045696.html">Y700 Gen 4</a> is priced at either 3299 CNY for the 12GB/256GB model or 3799 CNY for the 16GB/512GB variant. That works out to around $455 and $525, respectively, with the G9 controller priced at $69. In total, you're looking at about $600 for everything, which doesn't sound completely terrible compared to the Legion Tab and its $549 price tag.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:114.35%;"><img id="9HqHk6g5wiMGSVMfbtJqV" name="lenovo-legion-g9-controller-features" alt="Breakdown of different features found on the Lenovo G9 controller for the Y700 Gen 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9HqHk6g5wiMGSVMfbtJqV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="690" height="789" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo / Google Translate)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, it's highly unlikely that we would see Lenovo offer similar prices if it were to release the tablet and controller here in the U.S., but we'll see as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/business/us-china-trade-deal-announcement-intl-hnk">the tariff situation progresses</a>.</p><p>Despite Lenovo seemingly having a difficult time keeping the Legion Tab stocked, I'm not sure that the same would be true if it were more expensive. With that in mind, I'm not holding my breath for the latest Y700 and its controller to actually come to the States, but who knows what will happen. It's just awesome to see a company think outside of the box for once.</p>

<hr>
<p>Extremely early rumors surface about the next OnePlus flagship and its potential changes from the 13 model.</p><p>Rumors stem from a post by the Chinese Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.weibo.com/6048569942/PrrSQrdd0?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS), which alleges a new OnePlus phone is already in development (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-15-key-specifications-tipped/">91Mobiles</a>). While not stated explicitly, the phone is suspected to be the successor to the OnePlus 13, the OnePlus 15. This is due to the tipster's alleged discovery of the SM8850 SoC, which is suspected to be Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite 2.</p><p>A few other specifications suggest the OnePlus 15 could debut with a large, flat 6.7-inch LTPO display with 1.5K resolution.</p><p>The tipster also mentions the use of the LIPO packaging process, which the publication states may aid in further reducing its bezels. Lastly, the front of the device is said to feature a "symmetrical front" and likens it to the feel of an iPhone. On the flip side, the OnePlus 15 could boast a (machine-translated) 50MP periscope lens for its purported triple array.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that the number "4" is associated with bad luck, thus the reason behind OnePlus' expected number 14 skip.</p>

<p>Theories around the OnePlus 15's cameras seem to conflict, as the publication taps tipster Smart Pikachu. Per their information, the device could feature a wildly upgraded 200MP periscope lens, not 50MP.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">OnePlus 13 and the 13R</a> debuted on January 7 with a large amount of AI software and a refined camera system. The key aspect we're concerned with is the OnePlus 13's display, which is a 6.8-inch QHD+ screen at 2K resolution. The current rumors suggest consumers could be in for a slightly smaller display and a downgrade in resolution for the next flagship.</p><p>Additionally, the triple camera array for its soon-to-be predecessor included a 50MP primary lens, a 50MP ultrawide camera, and a 50MP 3x Triprism telephoto. Thanks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery tech</a>, the OnePlus 13 features a 6,000mAh battery. This may continue into the 15 edition, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 mention is interesting, considering there are rumors Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/early-snapdragon-8-elite-2-quicker-summit-phone-launch-rumors">could release it earlier this year</a>. Such rumors suggest Qualcomm's next Elite could launch at the end of September, which would roll right into phones expected to rock the SoC in early October. Speed-wise, the main core of the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 could reach 5GHz due to "enhanced Pegasus cores."</p><p>OnePlus usually releases its phones in China first before a global debut, and that may see a slight shift on the calendar this year.</p>

<h2 id="expect-a-long-road-of-os-and-security-updates-for-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-2">Expect a long road of OS and security updates for the Galaxy Z Flip 7</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is not expected to launch till July 2025, but all the rumors surrounding it so far point towards it being a pretty sizable upgrade. Samsung may finally have an offering that can go toe-to-toe with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-series-emulates-samsungs-three-product-strategy">Motorola's Razr Ultra 2025</a> flagship foldable.</p><p>The outer display of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is finally expected to go edge-to-edge, enveloping the outer cameras. It's nothing that we haven't seen before, but it's high time Samsung delivered such an outer display. A few leaks have also suggested we could see a slightly larger folding screen thanks to reduced bezels. All these changes could truly make it earn the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable</a> title, if Samsung follows through.</p><p>Software will most likely be new, with Samsung debuting One UI 8 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> in all likelihood. We have no idea what this will look like and what new features are going to be present, so we'll have to wait and see. If that's the case, then if Samsung sticks to its same update promise afforded to its other flagships, the phone may receive as many as seven years of updates, likely up to Android 23.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the specs of the Flip 7, it will most likely sport Samsung's custom '<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>' SoC, 12GB of RAM, and a base storage of 256GB. The cameras on the upcoming Flip are expected to be more or less the same, but the battery is expected to be a tiny bit larger. We hope to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-charging-speed">charging speed being bumped up to 45W</a> as well.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><u><em>Ultimate Guide</em></u><em>.</em></p>

<p>Just two years ago, the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 was one of the best clamshell foldables money could buy, but a lot has changed about Motorola flip phones over that span. Now, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is here, and it couldn't be more different from the Razr Plus 2023. The newer model is faster, has a bigger cover and inner screen, and sports a better camera system.</p><p>So, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a> worth upgrading to if you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>? With a high price tag, the better specs and polished experience might be enough to justify an upgrade. Additionally, the Razr Plus 2023's discounted prices might make it a sleeper option as an ultra-budget foldable in 2025. Let's break down how these two Motorola flagships, one current and one former, compare.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2023-pricing-and-availability-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Razr Plus 2023: Pricing and availability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4182px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tKsMgt6w3cLLWByePA9ebY" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-vs-Razr-Plus-2023-5" alt="The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and Razr Plus 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tKsMgt6w3cLLWByePA9ebY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4182" height="2352" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is available to purchase as of May 15 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola's online store. It costs $1,299.99 for the 512GB variant and $1,499.99 for the 1TB storage configuration. You can get it in Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Scarab, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret colorways.</p><p>While the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 is two years old, it's still available from trusted retailers in new condition. For example, you can get a Razr Plus 2023 in Infinite Black from Best Buy for just $349.99, and that drops to only $249.99 with cellular activation. Considering the latter price is over $1,000 cheaper than a new Razr Ultra 2025, the Razr Plus 2023 might be a sneaky budget option.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2023-design-and-display-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Razr Plus 2023: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-05" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a lot of physical similarities compared to its predecessor, but the differences start to pile up against the Razr Plus 2023. The newer model is bigger and heavier by nearly every measure, with dimensions of 73.99 x 171.48 x 7.29mm when open, compared to 73.95 x 170.83 x 6.99mm for the Razr Plus 2023. It weighs 199 grams, compared to the Razr Plus 2023's weight of 188.5 grams  — which could be a noticeable difference in your pocket.</p><p>The durability changes are interesting because the Razr Plus 2023 has better dust protection but weaker water resistance, thanks to its IP52 certification. By comparison, the Razr Ultra 2025 has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">IP48 dust and water resistance rating</a>. In simpler terms, the Razr Ultra 2025 can handle splashes and submersion in shallow freshwater for brief periods, whereas the Razr Plus 2023 cannot.</p><p>Additionally, the Razr Ultra 2025's hinge is stronger and sturdier, with titanium reinforcements within. The cover screen is protected by Gorilla Glass Ceramic, whereas the Razr Plus 2023 only has Gorilla Glass Victus.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AGhva8Br3mE9YRczDTadyM" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-1" alt="The Motorola Plus 2023 showing the display and hinge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGhva8Br3mE9YRczDTadyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the first thing you'll notice by looking at the Razr Ultra 2025 and Razr Plus 2023 side-by-side is that the newer model sports much larger displays. The cover screen on the Ultra model goes edge-to-edge, measuring 4 inches. The Razr Plus 2023's cover screen is no slouch at 3.6 inches, but it's not as immersive or capable due to size limitations.</p><p>Both cover screens are pOLED panels, with the Razr Ultra 2025 offering a slightly higher 165Hz refresh rate. Since the Razr Plus 2023 still offers a 144Hz refresh rate, this isn't likely to be noticeable in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sc9eyUbUzHfkfEH5dC2uPN" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-3" alt="The Motorola Plus 2023 showing the display and hinge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sc9eyUbUzHfkfEH5dC2uPN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the Razr Ultra 2025's main display, it's a 7-inch foldable pOLED screen with a "Super HD" moniker and 4,500 nits of peak brightness. In terms of size and display technology, this isn't a massive improvement over the Razr Plus 2023 and its 6.9-inch pOLED panel. However, the Razr Plus 2023 can only hit 1,400 nits of brightness, so the newer model will be much easier to see outdoors. Brightness matters more with foldable displays due to their glossy, plasticky coverings.</p><p>Colors are a bit subjective, but there is more room for personalization on the Razr Ultra 2025. The Razr Plus 2023 was offered in Infinite Black and Glacier Blue colorways, with a special Viva Magenta vegan leather option also available and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">Peach Fuzz</a> option that was announced later. With that being said, it seems like only the Infinite Black model is widely available in new condition in 2025.</p><p>That makes the Razr Ultra 2025, which is offered in four colorways at launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">with wood and Alcantara fabric materials</a> also available, the better choice for style.</p>

<p>The glaring problem with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 is that its processor and software support window are hardly future-proofed. The foldable has a Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip that isn't nearly as powerful as modern-day successors, and it shipped with Android 13.</p><p>While you can upgrade the Razr Plus 2023 to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> right now, it was only guaranteed three Android OS upgrades and four years os security updates. That means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> could be its last, although we'll see how long it takes Motorola to ready the update for the Razr Plus 2023.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Razr Ultra 2025 is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, which is the best mobile chip you'll find on an Android phone. It also has 16GB of memory and a RAM Boost feature, particularly helpful for AI tasks.</p>

<p>Both the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2023 have dual-camera systems, but the former is much more advanced. It features dual 50MP sensors, including a main and ultrawide lens. While the Razr Plus 2023 has the same lens types, it only offers a 12P main camera sensor and a 13MP ultrawide sensor. As such, the Razr Ultra 2025 will offer more detail and clarity than the Razr Plus 2023.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2023 has a solid 32MP front-facing camera, but the Razr Ultra 2025 has an even better 50MP lens. Of course, you can use the rear cameras as selfie cameras by simply using the cover screen.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 is by no means perfect, with an underpowered processor, waning software support, and potential durability concerns in 2025. But its discounted price makes this two-year-old flagship worth at least a look as modern offerings continue to get more expensive. While the Razr Ultra 2025 is obviously better than the Razr Plus 2023 in almost every way, it's hard to argue that the former is $1,000 better than the latter.</p><p>Looking at the 2025 lineup, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025</a> might each be better upgrade paths for Razr Plus 2023 owners. They're cheaper and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-makes-me-and-my-razr-plus-2023-jealous">still offer enough upgrades to make current Razr Plus 2023 users jealous</a>. However, there's no doubt that the Razr Ultra 2025 is the best foldable Motorola has ever made. If you can stomach the price, it's likely you'll enjoy the experience.</p>

<p>According to this latest leak, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 measures 158.4mm tall, 143.1mm wide, and just 3.9mm thick when unfolded. If that checks out, it’ll be Samsung’s tallest, widest, and thinnest foldable yet.</p>

<p>Trimming those bezels isn't just for show, it also makes the screen feel more immersive and give the whole device a cleaner, more premium look. It might seem like a small tweak, but on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it’s a big deal.</p><p>If this leak is on point, don’t be shocked if the Fold 6 ends up looking a little old-school next to its sharper, cleaner follow-up.</p>

This is because both devices share dimensions, sporting same-sized displays and identical shells.

<p>You might be confused to see some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-2024-screen-protectors">Razr 2024 screen guards</a> listed among the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025</a> screen protectors. Don't be, because both phones share measurements and are identical twins. The screen sizes are exactly the same, 6.9 inches on the inside and 3.6 inches on the outside.</p><p>For those of you who aren't aware, all new phones ship with factory-installed screen protectors. When it comes to foldables, it is not recommended to peel off the pre-installed screen protector unless absolutely necessary. This rule is particularly important for the folding internal display, but can be disregarded for the regular external screen.</p><p>If you aren't happy with the pre-installed internal screen protector, do your research and change it very carefully. Getting an expert to change it for you if you lack confidence is a good idea. I highly recommend waiting it out to see whether you can use your folding phone as is for a few weeks before making this decision.</p><p>Should you choose to only swap the external screen guard, the Supershieldz kit is the best overall screen protector for the Razr 2025. This is a well-known brand with consistently great reviews. The price is very reasonable and you get premium features like hydrophobic and oleophobic properties to repel dirt, fingerprints, oil, and other debris. Supershieldz includes two tempered glass screen protectors for the Motorola Razr 2025's cover display in the box, each with curved edges to achieve maximum coverage.</p><p>Alternatively, Deekeewe is another cheap option. This two-pack includes two tempered glass screen protectors for the front display as well as two flexible TPU films for the internal screen. The $12 price is undeniably a fantastic bargain and customer reviews are decent overall.</p>

Amazon has chopped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Cancelling-Compatibility-Microphone-Headphones/dp/B0C2W1KLSS"><strong>41% off the price of the Beats Studio Buds Plus wireless earbuds</strong>,</a> bringing the price back to its lowest point ever and dropping these to just shy of $100.</p><p>The Beats Studio Buds Plus are a pretty straightforward earbuds option, featuring active noise cancellation, clear phone calls and voice commands, and a solid battery life. Buyers like their overall comfort and sweat resistance, while they also come in four color varieties: black and gold, cosmic silver, ivory, and my personal favorite, the particularly unique-looking transparent option.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a pair of earbuds with great audio quality and a comfortable fit; you need something that will let you make clear phone calls; you want features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want a pair of earbuds with their own customizable EQ settings; you'd prefer something that's made to be highly compatible with Android devices; you're looking for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best earbuds </a>available and don't mind spending the extra money.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-studio-buds-plus-review">Beats Studio Buds Plus </a>feature a great overall audio profile, not unlike the rest of the Beats lineup. We love the balanced frequency response on these, in addition to their inclusion of ANC, and their crystal clear call quality. They feature simple, easy-to-use button controls, and up to 36 hours of battery life with the use of the charging case, or up to nine with just the earbuds. Most buyers also find them particularly comfortable, along with featuring IPX4 water and sweat resistance, making them a good pick for those who hope to use them when working out.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Beats is Apple-owned, so not all of the features made for iOS can be used with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. These also do not include their own customizable EQ features, though most Android and Apple devices will also have their own EQ suite, so that shouldn't be an issue for most users.</p>

The best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> cases are pretty limited for now, which is a stark contrast compared to the Razr 2025 and the Razr Plus 2025. This is probably in part because the latter models <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/can-i-use-a-motorola-razr-2024-case-on-a-razr-2025">can fit their last-gen counterparts' cases</a>, so there's a huge variety of cases to choose from.</p><p>But don't sweat it too much. Even if the official Razr Ultra 2025 case isn't available to buy in the U.S. yet, there are some outstanding brands like Clicks doing God's work. You can even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/this-is-not-a-drill-best-buy-bundled-up-the-new-motorola-razr-with-a-free-clicks-case">grab a Clicks Keyboard case for free</a> if you've pre-ordered the Razr 2025.</p><p>For now, here are the handful of decent phone cases available for the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025.</p>

<p>Clamshell foldables like the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 fold neatly into half and fit easily in pockets and bags. Small phones are easier to hold so you're less likely to drop them. Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">Razr Ultra 2025 comes with some unique finishes</a> like vegan leather, Alcantara, and wood. This is why I believe it's okay if you choose to forgo getting a case for the Razr Ultra altogether. Still, if you're adamant about getting a cover for safety, that's okay too.</p><p>As there aren't many options on the market just yet, your choices are narrower when buying a Razr Ultra 2025 phone cover. The best overall case you can buy is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/your-favorite-android-phones-are-finally-getting-these-once-iphone-only-nostalgic-cases">Clicks Keyboard</a> because it removes the onscreen keyboard and adds a physical one instead. It's a superb accessory that adds scratch-proofing and a useful feature. The price, however, is a tough pill to swallow. If you pre-ordered the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 though, you can bypass the paywall and score one <strong>free of cost</strong>!</p><p>If you missed out on this offer, there are cheaper alternatives to consider. ARMOR-X has two neat cases for the Razr Ultra and they're both priced about $20 or less. Then there's the transparent FNTCASE Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 Magnetic Case which is even cheaper and adds a magnetic ring on the back. The choice is yours, depending on whether you want to prioritize drop protection, extra features, or thinness.</p><p>For those readers who are still mulling over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">which Motorola Razr 2025 model to buy</a>, we've got a handy guide to assist your selection process.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-112">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung is rumored to be working on a new privacy feature for the Gallery app—a "Private album" to hide photos and videos.</li><li>The update is still in beta, and while it might not be in the final release, it's in the hidden “Labs” section for now.</li><li>The Private album could be a simpler version of Secure Folder, focused just on photos and videos.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Samsung is planning to beef up privacy in the One UI 8 Gallery app by adding a new way to keep your photos and videos out of sight.</p><p>While Samsung is still rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> in the U.S., early buzz around its follow-up is already starting to pop up. One UI 8, built on the upcoming Android 16, is already being tested behind the scenes. If all goes to plan, we’ll see it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-might-drop-the-one-ui-8-beta-way-earlier-than-we-think">drop sometime after Android 16 goes stable in June</a>, bringing some smart tweaks and smoother overall user experience.</p><p>X user @DalgleishGX spotted something interesting in the latest One UI 8 beta, namely a new “Private album” tucked right into the Samsung Gallery app. The leaker thinks it’s a simpler spin on Secure Folder, built just for hiding photos and videos without leaving the Gallery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:582px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:93.81%;"><img id="cNmQZLXgk43uPtJuynN2YB" name="Private-album-Gallery-app-One-UI-8" alt="a private album in the Samsung Gallery app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cNmQZLXgk43uPtJuynN2YB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="582" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @DalgleishGX / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">👀 Seems the latest leaked build of One UI 8 adds a Private Album feature to Samsung Gallery.This feature will most likely work like Secure folder but exclusively for photos and videos. pic.twitter.com/cFXegOLqht<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1920446883392053702">May 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-8-private-album-gallery-hide-images-leak/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, this “Private Album” feature might not come standard in the final One UI 8 rollout. Turns out, it lives in the hidden “Labs” section of the Gallery app. It's basically Samsung’s testing ground for experimental stuff that’s not meant for everyone just yet.</p><p>Some earlier guesses figured Samsung would use Android 15’s new Private Space API for this feature. That made sense, especially with talk of Secure Folder also jumping on board in One UI 8. Basically, it’d help make sure your hidden stuff stays hidden, and doesn’t randomly pop up where it shouldn’t.</p>
<h2 id="secure-folder-s-glow-up-2">Secure Folder’s glow-up</h2>
<p>Secure Folder is great if you want full-on lockdown for your apps and files, but it can feel a bit overkill for just hiding a few pictures. A built-in Private album sounds like an easier way to stash specific photos or videos without jumping through all those extra hoops.</p><p>Apart from Private album in Gallery, One UI 8 might step up how your phone handles background tasks, making everything run smoother. There’s talk of smarter app suggestions, better battery management, and more AI baked into the system.</p><p>Other leaks and rumors point to some cool new features in One UI 8, like video summarization in Samsung Internet and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-secure-folder-private-spaces-upgrade-rumored">upgrade to Secure Folder</a>.</p>

<p>This week, I flew to Plano, Texas, to check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-promises-100-percent-texas-manufacturing-ultrafactory-despite-oura-challenges">Ultrahuman's new factory</a>. After they walked me through every official step of manufacturing a smart ring, I did my best impression of a factory worker and built an Ultrahuman Ring Air from the raw parts. And it gave me a new appreciation for my own smart ring.</p><p>Smart rings aren't designed to be taken apart and put back together like other tech. You might know what sensors are inside, but you probably don't know what else is sitting inside all that titanium, resin, and ceramic, and what determines how thick these rings are.</p><p>But with Ultrahuman's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ring Air</a> in a sales and patent war with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a>, the company decided to show off its new American factory. This had the nice side effect of finally sating our curiosity about how smart rings are made, something other brands have been reluctant to talk to us about.</p><p>Plus, now I get to say that I helped make a smart ring that <em>someone</em> in the U.S. will buy!</p>

<p>The photo galleries below show nearly every step of Ultrahuman's smart ring-making process, starting with the creation of printed circuit boards (PCBs), which contain the SoC, PPG, IMU, temperature, and Bluetooth components.</p><p>These components are mass-producible — an engineer suggested one machine could produce 10,000 PCBs in a day — and made of fiberglass, polyamide, and ceramic materials, chosen to make them bendable enough to slide naturally into the rounded ring shape.</p><p>But the "UltraFactory" currently only makes about 400 smart rings per day, though Ultrahuman has promised to hit about 1,350 per day or 500,000 per year by the end of 2025. There are several pain points, starting with the fact that the other mass-produced components have to be soldered onto the PCB by hand.</p>

<p>After they create the PCBs, do internal and external spot checks for any flaws, and program each PCB with the requisite software, they're ready for the next step: soldering.</p><p>First, the Rx coil is soldered onto the PCB; then, the battery is soldered onto the coil. They brush off the excess alloy, leaving one seamless, bendable component ready to be inserted into the ring.</p>

<p>With a 3D-printed part, the welded-together PCB is curved into a proper J shape. The workers then apply glue to the titanium-carbon ring you're familiar with, remove the cover for the PCB's adhesive layer, and finally shove the component into place.</p><p>They do a software check — since technically, you could wear the ring at this point — and then place the ring inside a silicone mold. One mold with 12 rings is brought to the casting station, which is one part of the factory where they wouldn't let us photograph or record.</p><p>There, they inject epoxy resin into the ring from the thickest portion — the PPG — inside a vacuum-sealed chamber to prevent any resin bubbles. The process takes 24 hours, because heating the resin to harden it faster would damage the components. Ultrahuman said this casting process is one of the big pain points that slows down the ring process.</p>

<p>At this point, the smart ring is almost ready to be worn, but the resin will look rough and have hard edges that'll hurt your finger. They spend about 30 minutes cleaning and polishing it into consumer-ready form.</p><p>Once that's done, they do one more software check to ensure everything is up to code. Then, they place the ring on a 3D-printed part to check its size; if it won't fit or slides all the way down the cylinder, they know it's not to code. Otherwise, the Ultrahuman Ring Air is ready to be sold!</p>

<p>If you've been paying attention, you'll note that I couldn't make a smart ring from start to finish during this tour. The 24-hour resin process made that impossible. So it's more accurate to say that I got halfway through making a smart ring and then returned a different smart ring for the final part of the process. Nor did I get to handle any software or hardware QC.</p><p>I'm still going to say I made a smart ring, though. They told me my halfway-done smart ring <em>would</em> eventually be sold to someone, and that's pretty neat.</p>

<p>Following the steps above, I soldered the receiver coil onto the PCB by scraping some adhesive onto the coil and then stepping on a switch to trigger the machine (without burning off my thumbnail, thankfully). I then had to solder two separate points to attach the battery before brushing away the excess adhesive.</p><p>I curved the Ring Air components so they would fit inside, ripped off the adhesive with tweezers, shoved them inside the ring, and then pressed hard on the sensors to make them stick.</p><p>I was sure my clumsy, shaking fingers would break something, but it turned out my only issue was being too gentle. One portion came loose as I started to shove my smart ring into the casting mold, but I got it reattached and waved farewell to my ring.</p><p>Then they gave me another ring further along in the process and had me clean off the resin, using an electric spinning brush, sandpaper, and some 3M buffing fluid. I didn't get to finish the full 15+ minutes before Ultrahuman staff hustled me along to my interview, but I can honestly say I got that Ring Air into good enough shape that the resin wouldn't cut any fingers or look unsightly.</p>

<p>I asked Ultrahuman's CEO, Mohit Kumar, and chief business officer, Bhuvan Srinivasan, about smart ring repairability, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-are-disposable-tech" target="_blank">major issue with all smart rings</a>. The resin that keeps components in place and protected also makes it all but impossible to take rings apart for repair, and there are no visible buttons for resetting a malfunctioning ring.</p><p>They explained that they hope to add a tiny, hidden button to their smart rings. If a Ring Air is sent in for repair, they'll be able to remove a tiny bit of resin to hold down that button and reboot the ring into a mode where it can receive firmware updates.</p><p>I asked if they had any hopes for a more modular design that would let them remove and replace a battery, since smart ring batteries are so small and susceptible to losing capacity after a couple of years. Kumar replied that they're interested in it, but I got the sense that it's more of a pie-in-the-sky goal than something they're actively pursuing at the moment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YBixJGMPUduATKvadXrW8Q" name="Ultrahuman-factory-tour-ring-components-and-chart" alt="The different components of the Ultrahuman Ring Air in an dark, open-top felt box, with a diagram of ring components next to it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YBixJGMPUduATKvadXrW8Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For now, they're more focused on optimization. Because American labor costs are higher than in their Indian facility, they're looking to make the process more efficient; for example, they found a new casting machine that would inject resin into four times as many rings at once, breaking open that bottleneck in the factory line.</p><p>As for me, I'm curious how the manufacturing processes of other smart rings differ from those of Ultrahuman and how they are evolving as the tech improves. But proprietary differences aside, the UltraFactory experience gave me respect for the amount of quality control that goes into making a smart ring — while also surprising me that someone like me with no industrial experience can go through the steps with enough hand-holding and patience.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Did you know that all Android apps will be required to support 16 KB pages in the future? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/prepare-play-apps-for-devices-with-16kb-page-size.html" target="_blank">Google says this change is necessary</a> to make the system more efficient. While this information is interesting, the good news is that, as an Android user, you don't need to know or care about it at all.</p><p>Still, it's a significant change. Software can't stay backward compatible forever, and as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101811/0104/Translation-granule" target="_blank">hardware it powers advances</a>, things have to be adapted. A 16 KB page size means the system can spend more resources keeping everything smooth instead of writing table entries, and we all want things to run smoothly.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD" name="Google-services.jpg" alt="Google apps in a single folder on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In case you're wondering, Android currently uses a 4 KB page size. Inside a processor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit" target="_blank">memory management units</a> keep track of the physical location of all data in your phone's memory on a "page size" basis. Making that page size four times bigger means the system needs to make these translations four times less often. That's it. That's the whole enchilada.</p><p>For us, this means that possible bottlenecks can be avoided. We've all seen our phones stop doing anything for a second or two. This could be when opening or closing an app or loading a large app in the background. It can and does happen, but with this new change, this is less likely to be a problem in the future.</p><p>According to Google, the move to 16 KB page sizes means faster app launches from 3% to 30%, improved battery usage, quicker camera startup time, and speedier system boot-ups. Many of the changes may seem small, but the point is that things should cumulatively get better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5NibDvY72Uz7W65cCXUraB" name="64-bit" alt="Android is a 64-bit OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5NibDvY72Uz7W65cCXUraB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Memory management is very intricate and finicky. Small hiccups can cascade into something that we notice, though usually, it's all pretty seamless. Sometimes, a larger page size is part of the solution. Anything that is both future-proof and has the potential to improve performance is a welcome change.</p><p>Remember when Android started requiring all apps to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-releases-64-bit-android-l-emulator-intel-processors">support 64-bit processors</a>? I don't blame you if you don't. I think it's safe to say that none of us really noticed the difference. The change was needed to make sure that Android was ready for hardware advancements, but the change most likely made very little difference once it all trickled down to the user.</p><p>When there is better performance, everyone is happy, so the requirements are changing to support it all. This is the same sort of change. The page size on your phone has grown to a bigger size. With a bigger page size, there can be better performance.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>Starting November 1st, 2025, all new apps and updates to existing apps submitted to Google Play and targeting Android 15+ devices must support 16 KB page sizes.</p><p>Dan Brown, Google Play product manager</p></blockquote></div>
<p>You don't need to understand what a 16 KB page size is any more than you need to know what a 64-bit OS means. It's interesting and important all the same, so you'll see people talking about it.</p><p>Feel free to ignore all the jargon and complicated stuff in the article, or just think of it as Google doing what needs to be done to keep Android relevant in 2025 and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-117">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 FE is on the horizon, and it might ditch Exynos 2400e for the Dimensity 9400 processor.</li><li>The upcoming device is originally planned with Samsung's in-house chip to keep costs down, but production issues may force a backup plan.</li><li>The Dimensity 9400 is no slouch: it's a 3nm powerhouse, but it’s also pricier since Samsung has to buy it from MediaTek.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is expected to land later this year, and while it's previously rumored to run on the Exynos 2400e, a new report claims Samsung might swap in the Dimensity 9400 instead.</p><p>Samsung's next Fan Edition model is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a> of the year, and for good reason. It’s expected to hit the sweet spot between solid performance and a wallet-friendly price.</p><p>To keep things balanced, Samsung needs to cut a few corners strategically. One way it could pull that off is by dropping in its own in-house chip to keep costs down without totally skimping on power.</p><p>Rumor has it that Samsung has already started cranking out Exynos 2400e chips, supposedly for the Galaxy S25 FE. That tracks, since most of the past Fan Edition phones have stuck with Samsung’s own chips.</p><p>However, a fresh scoop from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Galaxy-S25-FE-might-launch-with-a-Dimensity-9400-instead-of-an-Exynos-2400e.1013100.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a> suggests Samsung might have to pivot to MediaTek’s Dimensity 9400, thanks to some hiccups in its current chip production.</p>
<h2 id="chip-production-is-likely-getting-messy-2">Chip production is likely getting messy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ignmNpbWJn3Strf6Xggao3" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-ai-generated-wallpaper-flower" alt="A Samsung Galaxy 24 FE in the sun with High Brightness Mode enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ignmNpbWJn3Strf6Xggao3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notebookcheck has floated the idea that Samsung might be splitting chip production between the Galaxy S25 FE and the upcoming Z Flip FE, which has stirred up some concern. Earlier this year, word got out that Samsung Foundry was cutting its chip output by half to tackle quality issues. All these bumps in the road have fans wondering if Samsung can keep up with demand when these new devices finally arrive.</p><p>According to the outlet, switching to the MediaTek chip is more of a backup plan, something Samsung might pull the trigger on if it can’t pump out enough Exynos 2400e chips in time for the next Fan Edition release.</p><p>Samsung is no stranger to using MediaTek chips, but swapping in the Dimensity 9400 for the S25 FE isn’t without drawbacks. While the 9400 packs more power, it also comes with a bigger price tag since Samsung would have to buy it from MediaTek. On the flip side, sticking with the Exynos 2400e helps to save costs.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-expect-a-price-hike-2">Don’t expect a price hike</h2>
<p>The Dimensity 9400 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">turned heads last year as the first 3nm chip to land in an Android phone</a>. Meanwhile, the Exynos 2400e, built on a slightly older 4nm process, doesn’t quite hit the same performance highs as MediaTek’s fresh new silicon.</p><p>Even with a beefier chip, Samsung is probably not going to raise the price of the Galaxy S25 FE. It wants to keep it affordable and competitive, so if it does switch to the Dimensity 9400, it'll likely absorb the extra cost rather than pass it on to buyers.</p>

Motorola left smartwatches behind for years, licensing out its watches to another company. Now Motorola seems to be stepping back into the fray with the Moto Watch Fit. But it needs more than the Moto Watch name to make its budget squircle watch stand out in a crowded field.</p><p>Long-time Android fans still think fondly about the Moto 360, which was ahead of its time with its cool gesture controls and seamless design in 2014. I wrote in March that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-doesnt-motorola-make-another-wear-os-watch">Motorola should return to Wear OS</a> with a spiritual successor to the 360.</p><p>Instead, a month later, we got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">budget Moto Watch Fit</a>, with its 1.9-inch squircle display, 16-day battery life, 100 sports modes, and "real-time fitness stats and intelligent sleep tracking."</p><p>It's the fifth Moto Watch tracker after the Watch 40, 70, 100, and 120, a mix of circular and squircle watches with the same basic fitness software and Google Fit integration.</p><p>Two weeks ago, I sent Motorola a series of questions. I wanted to know how the Watch Fit's "advanced fitness and wellness assistance features," how the companion app would work, and other basic questions. I'm still waiting on answers, and the more I research the Moto Watch brand, the more confused I get.</p>

<p>The Moto Watch Fit isn't on sale yet, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/gb/en/p/motoaccessories/moto-watch-fit-smartwatch-1/pg38c07182">Motorola UK site</a> says this new model is "designed and manufactured by/for Motorola Mobility LLC."</p><p>Given the Moto branding, that should be obvious, right? But the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motowatch.com/" target="_blank">Moto Watch site</a> lists Calgary-based CE Brands, Inc. as an "official brand licensee of Motorola" that "ensures global sales and support for the products found on this site," like the Moto Watch 120, 70, and 40.</p><p>CE Brands, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vitalist.co/">Vitalist</a>, says on its site that it "designs, manufactures, and sells" wearables, and lists Moto Watch as "our brand." And this 2024 Vitalist <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vitalist.co/press-releases/ce-brands-expands-motorola-smartwatch-lineup-with-all-new-moto-watch-120">press release</a> explicitly says the Moto Watch 120 is "the latest addition to [CE Brands'] line of Motorola smartwatches" as Motorola's "strategic brand partner."</p><p>If you look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.cebrands.motowatch&hl=en_US">Moto Watch 100 app</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ebuynow.motowatchlite&hl=en_US">Moto Watch 70 app</a> on the Play Store, both are managed by CE Brands, Inc. These apps have some pretty brutal ratings too, with many users calling them "barely functional" because they stopped syncing with Google Fit or allowing phone notifications on the watch without constant resets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fCzFsKodcSRNtdXXNW7QL8" name="moto-watch-100-app" alt="Screenshots of the Moto Watch 100 companion app showing the fitness features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCzFsKodcSRNtdXXNW7QL8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A CE Brands-made Moto Watch app (rated 2.2/5 on the Play Store) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CE Brands)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After a little digging, I realized that CE Brands owned eBuyNow, the subsidiary that made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-360-2020-gets-performance-boost-with-first-major-wearos-update">Moto 360 (3rd Gen)</a> in 2020. CE Brands <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/26/2694386/0/en/CE-Brands-Announces-Voluntary-Bankruptcy-of-Subsidiary-and-Resignation-of-CFO.html">went bankrupt in 2023</a> before rebranding eBuyNow as Vitalist in 2023, promising to "deliver biometric and biomarker insights to consumers."</p><p>The Moto Watch Fit <em>isn't</em> listed on the Moto Watch site, and Vitalist didn't write a press release about this model, either. That suggests Motorola may have taken over the brand, while ditching the numbered names for a Moto Watch revamp.</p><p>But it's also possible that Motorola Mobility designed the old Moto Watches, while CE Brands handled the health and software tools. It's hard to say, as the licensing deal makes it nebulous. Maybe Vitalist will make the Watch Fit health software, too?</p><p>Regardless, that's really all besides the point. My main point is that Motorola is best known for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-reminds-me-that-i-dont-need-the-best">making flagship phones from everyone else look overpriced</a> by offering similar perks in cheaper packages. However, the Moto Watch lineup has never really stood out against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> <em>or</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>, and Motorola has a lot to prove with the Watch Fit when it launches.</p>
<h2 id="how-will-the-moto-watch-live-up-to-the-moto-name-2">How will the Moto Watch live up to the Moto name?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="7JxfeTWgpfRjw9tPqDhDng" name="motorola-watch-fit-rendering-official" alt="The Motorola Watch Fit in its Trekking Green band color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7JxfeTWgpfRjw9tPqDhDng.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Look at the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness trackers</a> out there: companies like Amazfit and Xiaomi have put intense effort into full-fledged health suites, AI coaching, and dedicated fitness tools in an affordable package. And you have bigger names like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-tracker-finally-comes-to-us">Galaxy Fit 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> that sync directly with the biggest health apps, with their own AI insights and (for Fitbit) Google apps.</p><p>Motorola phone fans will see the Moto Watch branding and look for something affordable, long-lasting, and straightforward. However, the Watch Fit needs <em>some</em> kind of signature feature to stand out and keep these users happy.</p><p>CE Brands had an interesting Effort Points system that, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a>, scored your all-day effort based on your time in HR zones. But the Moto Watch Fit might use an entirely different system, and it'll have to compete with watch brands that invest huge amounts of money in health & fitness R&D.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LSUEJejvdLNuNjidXvgLMQ" name="Moto-Watch-Fit-frame" alt="Moto Watch Fit frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LSUEJejvdLNuNjidXvgLMQ.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One sign of Motorola taking more direct ownership is how the Watch Fit can use Moto AI text prompts to generate watch faces. That's a unique trick, one I'm hoping Google emulates on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> this year. We'll see if people see it as a highlight or a five-minute gimmick; however, it'll depend on how good these AI-made faces are.</p><p>Otherwise, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-expands-its-device-ecosystem-with-the-new-moto-watch-fit-and-moto-buds-loop-featuring-sound-by-bose-technology-and-swarovski-crystals/">press release</a> mentions "seamless smartphone integration," but only mentions notifications, music controls, and camera controls. An RTOS watch can rarely do much more than that, even though many people will buy a Moto Watch hoping for actionable notifications and replies. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-balance-review">Amazfit Balance</a> pulls this off with text-to-speech and a keyboard, but I don't expect it from the Moto Watch Fit.</p><p>Ultimately, aside from the Moto AI gimmick, the Moto Watch Fit sounds pretty generic. The built-in GPS on a cheap tracker is a nice perk, but it's not uncommon these days — see the $99 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-active-2-announced-ces-2025">Amazfit Active 2</a> — and most fitness trackers have 100+ sports modes and IP68 water resistance.</p><p>That said, we've reached out to Motorola for more information about the Watch Fit, and we will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QmFCxFKoGPbvD6xfoqSZLB" name="Motorola-Adaptive-Display-MWC-wearing-05.jpg" alt="The Motorola Adaptive Display concept phone at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QmFCxFKoGPbvD6xfoqSZLB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Motorola concept device for a wearable, bendable smartphone at MWC </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto Watch brand is like a time capsule to an early smartwatch era when they didn't try to squeeze dozens of features and a full AI-backed health suite into a device. Some people will appreciate its simplicity, affordability, and longevity; others will be frustrated by the lack of Motorola flair they've come to expect from its foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a>.</p><p>It will ultimately come down to whether this Motorola-made wearable delivers a higher standard of quality than past Moto Watches.</p><p>I'm not sure why Motorola has been so hands-off with wearables up until this point, selling budget trackers through its licensee for years while spending R&D on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/motorola-adaptive-display-concept-best-for-sci-fi-not-real-life-use">wearable phone concepts</a> like the one above.</p><p>Maybe Motorola was truly so burned by its Android Wear experience that it never wanted to go back; clearly, Lenovo phone sales are strong enough despite not having a full "ecosystem" of devices. Or maybe it isn't willing to spend the money on health & fitness necessary to compete with Samsung Health and Fitbit.</p><p>Whatever the reason, the Moto Watch Fit needs to be a stepping stone to bigger and better things if Motorola wants to make an impact in the wearable space.</p>

<p>I'm an absolute sucker for new hardware, especially if it's paired with something else new and shiny, such as a recently launched processor. That same passion has trickled beyond the confines of phones, tablets, and Chromebooks and into the world of dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>. They come in all shapes and sizes, with varying levels of emulation power and form factors.</p><p>While I've written about why I prefer using gaming handhelds over my phone, recent events have, <em>ahem,</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-tariffs-are-a-great-reason-to-keep-the-phone-you-have-as-long-as-you-can">affected the market</a>. Even Linux-driven handhelds that were once cheap are seeing price increases that don't exactly justify a recommendation. With that in mind, I figured now would be a great time to revisit emulation and gaming on your phone.</p>

<p>If we're going to go all out, you'll need one more piece before turning your phone into a mobile gaming station. Gone are the days when we had to <em>only</em> rely on console controllers, as there are so many different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">phone controllers</a>, it's enough to make your head spin.</p><p>With so many options, it can be difficult to actually make a decision on what to get, so you'll want to figure out the features and options that you want. If you don't care about bulk or have a device with a larger screen, then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir G8 Plus</a> is my first recommendation. It relies on Bluetooth, but can be expanded to fit the 14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, without much hassle.</p><p>Do you need something that is more compact? Check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Tessen</a>, which is one that I keep in my bag whenever I'm going to be away from home for more than just a day or two. It connects via USB-C, offers passthrough charging, and features programmable rear paddle buttons.</p>

<p>More recently, I've fallen back in love with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/we-need-more-accessories-like-the-new-backbone-one-xbox-edition">Backbone One</a>, but more specifically, the Xbox Edition. It's not quite as ergonomic as the others, but it simply looks awesome, and I like the way that the buttons feel. That being said, I'm definitely keen on checking out the new Backbone One Pro, which was just recently announced and has a few unique tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>What if you're on a budget or just don't want to spend a bunch of money on a phone controller? There are plenty of options there, too, starting with just getting a phone clip for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OIVO-Controller-Mobile-Playstation-Dualsense/dp/B08QZC4G25">DualSense</a> or Xbox controller. Until fairly recently, the only options we had were to clip onto the controller on one end and phones on the other. However, we're starting to see more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanism-Controller-Xbox-Wireless-Android-Core/dp/B0D8826FTP/">magnetic mounts</a>, which is excellent.</p><p>But if you like the idea of having a dedicated controller for your phone, then something like the budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Controller-Lightweight-Ergonomic-Controller/dp/B0DXPMVCWC">GameSir X5 Lite</a> will be up your alley. It's priced at just $35, connects via USB-C, and is designed to work with devices like the iPad Mini, with its 8.3-inch display.</p>

<p>I've been pretty critical about the Play Store when it comes to how it functions as a central place to discover and download new apps on Android. However, I don't share that same sentiment in regards to games, even if the top charts are overflowing with "Gacha" games. Thankfully, I very rarely ever actually look at the top charts, and it's all thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-games-google-play-pass">Google Play Pass</a>.</p><p>It helps that there's a dedicated tab at the bottom of the app, which lets me avoid the wasteland of regular Play Store games. That's not to say that every game available through Play Pass is a banger. But I will say that if Google separated it out of my Google One plan, I'd add another monthly subscription to my bills.</p><p>Seriously, Play Pass includes Stardew Valley, Dead Cells, Terraria, and Thimbleweed Park, just to name a few. If I were to buy just those four games, it'd cost me almost $30. Which just so happens to be what it costs to sign up for Play Pass for an entire year. Plus, if you have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a>, there's a chance that you can get six months for free, and you didn't even know it.</p>

<p>Before getting to my favorite part, what if you're a console or PC gamer, and want to be able to play from anywhere? There are actually quite a few options, starting off with the obvious ones like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-play-xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-on-chromebooks">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>, PlayStation Plus Premium, and Amazon Luna. While dedicated first-party apps are available for those services, you might want to take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studio08.xbgamestream&hl=en_US">XBPlay</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng">chiaki-ng</a> for a spin, as I've found these to offer much better experiences.</p><p>From there, we have the likes of GeForce Now and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://boosteroid.com/">Boosteroid</a>, which tie into multiple platforms and make your games accessible over the cloud. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/geforce-now">GeForce Now</a> is another one of those subscriptions that you'll have to rip from me, as I've been signed up for as long as I can remember. It's been the best cloud gaming service that I've ever used, and quickly filled the void left when Stadia was retired.</p><p>While I have no plans to ditch my GeForce Now subscription, there is another solution that has been slowly becoming a favorite of mine. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo">Apollo</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/moonlight-android">Artemis</a> are community-built forks for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android">Moonlight</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine">Sunshine</a>. Basically, think of it like GeForce Now, but with ALL of your games. Instead of relying on NVIDIA's servers, which do have various restraints, Apollo and Artemis have no limitations, as <em>you</em> can install and manage everything.</p>

<p>Now for the fun part — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulation</a>. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget phones</a> are more capable than you might think. For example, the Snapdragon 865, which is now more than five years old, is still capable of emulating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/this-is-how-nintendo-aims-to-stop-switch-2-emulation">Switch</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3</a> games on Android. That's probably more of an outlier than a rule, but it still proves my point.</p><p>When it comes to the emulators that make all of this possible, there are a couple of different routes to take. The first of which is to download a separate emulator for each console that you want to play. However, that can be annoying and cumbersome on a good day, so it's not really something that I'd recommend.</p><p>Instead, I've compiled a list of the various emulators that I would recommend, starting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>. This single app can handle all the way up to PS2, and includes a bunch of extra features such as built-in shader support and the ability to rack up your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://retroachievements.org/">RetroAchievements</a>. Another great aspect of RetroArch is that it can run on basically anything besides a literal potato, but even then, you might find some luck.</p>

<p>You'll also notice that I've listed a few options for different consoles. Much of this can simply be attributed to some emulators working better with certain processors and devices than others. It's really just about doing a bit of trial runs to see what doesn't work while having alternatives if you need them.</p>

<p>It's great that you have all of your games, streaming apps, and emulators downloaded. But even if you throw everything into one folder, it doesn't really give you that true gaming experience. That's where launchers come into play, of which I rotate between three different ones.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://es-de.org/" target="_blank">ES-DE</a> is the Android version of the popular EmulationStation launcher available on x86 devices. It includes support for more than 150 different systems and makes it easy to scrape your games to show the artwork and download different themes based on your style.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/likeich/console-launcher" target="_blank">Console Launcher</a> is a newcomer to my arsenal, but I've been using it on and off for the six months or so. While ES-DE might seem a bit more polished, Console Launcher feels better suited for Android, designed for the platform from the ground up. There are a bunch of features, including a dedicated "Samsung DeX" mode, which avoids any potential issues faced by Samsung's limitations on launchers.</p><p>Although this isn't the definitive list, the last one that I've primarily used is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magneticchen.daijishou" target="_blank">Daijisho</a>. It has most, if not all, of the same features as the other two but simply offers a different design. Like ES-DE or Console Launcher, there are a variety of themes that you can download and apply if you want to change things up.</p>

<p>As I said before, you don't <em>need </em>a dedicated gaming handheld just to play games on the go. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phone in your pocket</a> is more than capable of playing thousands upon thousands of games. And that includes those who want to dip their toes into the world of emulation, provided that you understand the potential limitations.</p><p>Nevertheless, I hope this has helped give you some sense of direction as to how you can set up a phone or tablet to become the mobile gaming beast that it's capable of being. It'll definitely take a bit of time to get everything set up, but that hard work will pay off when you can just turn on your phone and start playing.</p>

After LG's departure, it was one of the only other smartphones to carry a built-in stylus, aside from Samsung's premium S phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. So naturally, with the Moto G Stylus 2025, there's a bit of pressure to really entice customers away from a flagship phone that costs more than three times as much.</p><p>Fortunately, I think Motorola has nailed it. The Stylus 2025 improves on last year's model in ways I didn't think the company was ready for, with specs that easily rival some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. And while the $400 price tag means you won't get all the capabilities of a premium Android smartphone, the Moto G Stylus 2025 has just about everything you'd need without all the superfluous bells and whistles that end up costing you $1000 or more.</p>

The phone retails for $399 when purchased unlocked from Motorola and retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.</p><p>Color options include Gibraltar Sea and Surf the Web, although availability may depend on the carrier. Depending on where you buy it, you get 128GB or 256GB of storage, but it'll come with 8GB of RAM either way.</p>

<p>I've previously noted how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-hands-on">there are a lot of things to like about the Moto G Stylus 2025</a>, and after spending more time with the phone, all of that still rings true. The phone has a wonderfully simple yet effective design that mirrors some of last year's flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch">Edge 50 Ultra</a>. The camera housing has evolved to a more stove-like design, while the vegan leather encases the entire back nicely. It's a soft and very comfortable phone to hold.</p><p>It's a pretty large phone, with a display at 6.7 inches, but the bezels are smaller than you'd expect for a phone at this price point. The phone is also a hair thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a>, but the battery capacity is still the same, which is nice.</p>

<p>Motorola did something I didn't expect with the Stylus display, pushing it beyond what many midrange (and most flagships) offer by giving it a Super HD resolution. It's not a resolution I've seen much on a smartphone, but it makes the OLED display appear incredibly crisp.</p><p>It's surprising, given how Motorola is pushing a higher resolution than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, while increasing brightness to 3,000 nits. The result is a sharp, bright display that's almost as good as the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a>, and frankly, I would love to see more flagship phones with this resolution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JKoxYYDWmWfPYVPEEMTgmZ" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-review-11" alt="A video playing on the Moto G Stylus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKoxYYDWmWfPYVPEEMTgmZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, coupled with 8GB of RAM. I would've loved to see a more powerful chip, maybe something in the 7 series, but after using the phone over the past few weeks, I can happily report that the phone performs quite well. The software is snappy, apps open quickly, and games play quite well.</p><p>You may experience some dropped frames if you're playing something graphically heavy like Honkai: Star Rail on the highest settings, but the phone is more than capable of smooth gameplay on high settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4189px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gXztokz46NhGh3KzZN6R2Z" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-review-12" alt="Honkai: Star Rail on the Moto G Stylus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gXztokz46NhGh3KzZN6R2Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4189" height="2356" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box. It's not much different from Android 14, and Motorola's Hello UX is a mostly inoffensive take on Android. There's not much built-in customization, at least on the levels you'll find on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>, for example, but I don't see this as a downside, especially if you want to keep things simple. After all, it's a $400 phone, so anyone buying this most likely isn't a power user.</p><p>I appreciate the noticeable lack of bloatware. Aside from a random gaming folder that you can easily disable and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/glance-reportedly-us-bound-later-2024">Glance screen</a> that's turned off by default, Motorola has done a great job minimizing unnecessary software on its midrange and budget phones.</p><p>I also appreciate that Motorola is improving its software update promise, even by a little. The phone is set to receive two OS upgrades and three years of bi-weekly software updates. Last year's Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 has been receiving updates pretty consistently, and the Moto G Stylus 2023 received Android 14 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-14-is-finally-coming-to-the-motorola-razr-and-razr-plus-and-it-only-took-a-year">before the Razr Plus 2023 did</a>, so I'm hoping Motorola can keep this up.</p>

<p>There is some AI here, but don't expect a Pixel 9a here. Motorola's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features are mostly reserved for higher-end phones, but there are still some goodies here worth pointing out. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is one of my favorite features, and it's great to see it on this phone.</p><p>In addition to the usual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> AI editing capabilities, Motorola also included a new Sketch to Image feature that generates images in different styles based on what you draw. It's a neat feature and works fairly similarly to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">feature of the same name</a>, although not as fully featured. Still, it's a fun feature to show off and potentially a great way to keep a toddler occupied if necessary.</p>

<p>Another way Motorola applies AI is to the camera experience. The company upgraded the Moto G Stylus 2025 to a 50MP Sony LYTIA 700C sensor, and while last year's phone took pretty respectable photos, I've not been disappointed with the photo quality from this camera either. For the most part, images are crisp and vibrant, particularly in good lighting.</p><p>You can get some pretty good natural-looking bokeh from images, and the macro shots from the ultrawide camera are also surprisingly good for those of you who like to take close-up shots of nature.</p>

<p>Compared to last year's model, the Stylus 2025 doesn't attempt to brighten shadows nearly as much. On the other hand, images from the Stylus 2024 can sometimes appear a bit artificial and have flatter colors.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="470" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=2991b150-2d15-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>

<p>Where the AI comes in is with Action Shot, which can capture very high-speed images of moving subjects to reduce blur and ensure the subject is in focus. You can see from the images below how the Stylus 2025 does a much better job of capturing running water or a train in motion, although it may come at the expense of some dynamic range.</p><p>Basically, this is a nice feature to have if you own pets or have kids.</p>

<p>Battery life is pretty great, which is par for the course for Motorola's G series. I could easily get a day of use from the Stylus 2025, and you'll likely get the same or more, depending on your use.</p><p>Motorola also managed to get 68W charging on a $400 phone, which feels too good to be true for North America, but it really is incredible. From 1%, the phone will reach 50% in 20 minutes and 100% in 39 minutes. Someone tell Samsung.</p>

<p>Like last year's model, the Moto G Stylus 2025 utilizes an in-display fingerprint sensor. Frankly, it's not bad, but it's not my favorite either. It takes a second to register, and it's placed uncomfortably low on the display. This is the same issue I had with the Stylus 5G 2024, so it's annoying to see here, too.</p><p>Furthermore, the sensor flashes a very bright white when you use it, which is particularly jarring, especially when using the phone in dark spaces.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BMTnKb3KZxobYAXp3acZp7" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-review-3" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 fingerprint sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BMTnKb3KZxobYAXp3acZp7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera also has a few quirks, which I hope Motorola can tweak or fix with future updates. The phone does well in good lighting conditions, and post-processing can sometimes nicely enhance images beyond what is captured, but it doesn't seem to do too well in trickier lighting situations. As a result, some images can appear too dark or heavy in contrast. Again, it's about preference, but I would like to see at least some improvements with how it handles darker scenes.</p><p>It seems funny that this is even an issue, given Motorola's curious and seemingly pointless inclusion of a 3-in-1 light sensor (that third "camera" on the back).</p><p>Furthermore, while video can be pretty decent and stable up to 1080p at 60fps, things will start to crap out once you hit 4K30. The camera would often crap out and completely crash when trying to record a 4K video, which is kind of a bummer.</p>

<p>On the software front, it would have been nice to see Motorola give the phone more Moto AI features, even if they're cloud-based, although at $400, this isn't really something we should expect from a device at this price point.</p><p>Similarly, with Motorola's software promise, which admittedly could be better. We've seen the company offer a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/motorola-moto-g75-5g-rugged-phone-review">mid-range G-series phone</a> five OS upgrades and six years of software updates, and it would be nice to see that level of support on what could be considered the company's "hero" Moto G phone in North America.</p>

<p>Finally, while its nice to still have a stylus phone other than Samsung's premium Galaxy S25 Ultra, it feels a bit laggy, even after Motorola alleged to improve responsiveness by 4X.</p><p>I do like that Motorola finally gave it some purpose by adding the Sketch to Image feature, but I can't help but wonder if Motorola would be better off including an active stylus like an S Pen for potentially better usability or just doing away with it altogether and giving us a bigger battery or something.</p>

<p>At this price point, the closest competitor for the Moto G Stylus 2025 would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Samsung Galaxy A36</a>. Because it's Samsung, you're getting a much better software promise and some fun built-in AI features like Object Eraser. However, charging speed is still slower, the screen isn't as sharp, there's less base RAM, and you don't get expandable storage.</p><p>You could also spring for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> if you don't mind spending a little more. This way, you could get a better software promise, more color options, and tons of AI features. However, it costs $100 more, and you'll miss out on the faster charging speeds.</p><p>You could also go for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro</a>, both of which are similarly priced and have impressive specs. However, they may also be hard to get a hold of as they're only available through Nothing's beta program, and carrier support isn't as robust or reliable.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're in the market for a good, affordable phone.</li><li>You want a phone with a built-in stylus pen.</li><li>You want good battery life and fast charging.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want all the latest AI features from Google.</li><li>You plan to keep the phone for more than three years.</li></ul>
<p>It's tough to find reasons not to recommend the Moto G Stylus 2025. Despite some of its drawbacks, this is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">best Android phones under $400</a>, and one you definitely shouldn't sleep on, even with more expensive phones like the Pixel 9a looming over it.</p><p>The specs and performance make this a great phone for the price, and the camera is surprisingly good, even if it needs a bit of tweaking. And while the phone isn't perfect, none of the negatives feel like dealbreakers to me, even after a few weeks. Ultimately, the Moto G Stylus 2025 solidifies Motorola as the king of affordable phones in North America.</p>

<p>Think about a phone that you know is coming but hasn't been announced just yet. Whether you're thinking of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-google-pixel-10-rumor-hints-at-pricing-changes">Pixel 10</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Z Fold 7</a>, or any other phone, one of the specifications you'll see people asking about is how fast it charges. Why?</p><p>The obvious answer is so we get more use out of it. We all know the battery isn't going to last the promised amount of time because it never does, and to keep using the phone we're going to need to charge the battery. If we can do that faster, we're able to do more.</p>
<p>But the real answer isn't as simple: it's the only way phone makers can address the problem right now. Monkeying around with a smarter charging circuit is easier — and cheaper — than fixing the root cause: we need batteries to get "better."</p>
<p>That means what you think it means and what you probably aren’t thinking of. Ideally, a phone manufacturer would find a way to build a device that looks good, is waterproof, and has a way to easily change the battery when it goes dead. That’s never going to happen, and maybe it shouldn’t — sealed “soft” batteries are safer and have higher capacity than older hard and removable batteries.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Q9TmqfkQgaSaymw3FWzGQ" name="Anker-Prime-battery-plugged-in.jpg" alt="An Anker Prime 27500mAh battery pack charging up multiple devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Q9TmqfkQgaSaymw3FWzGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The next best solution would be a battery that's simply a lot bigger. We see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">these unicorn devices</a> every once in a while, packing a battery that's big enough to last all day for everyone. Those devices are also usually thicker, so they're not proposed as the most premium flagship design from the manufacturer. Maybe they should be.</p>
<p>Finally, you have the battery technology itself. The types of batteries used in most phones today are designed to be high capacity compared to their small size, charge quickly, and are relatively long-lasting. They're good — way better than older stuff, and if you've been using battery-powered devices for a long time, you know it firsthand. But technology has improved, and it's possible to build a battery that's a lot better in the ways that matter. It's also more expensive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ViNkhhFKCSzyoztkyqLXoQ" name="oneplus-13-battery-life-02" alt="OnePlus 13 battery life at 70% charge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ViNkhhFKCSzyoztkyqLXoQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The easy fix comes from companies that spend a little money to find ways to charge faster while still being safe. Thankfully, people haven't stopped looking into better ways to fix it all.</p>
<p>Developing better ways to manage power consumption and optimize charging is part of that. Faster charging is a good thing as long as the side effects (battery degradation and efficiency) are hit too hard. Current battery technology is also something companies are fiddling with, altering the liquid used inside of them and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/stories/oppo-find-x8-series-battery/" target="_blank">the materials used</a> for the anode and cathode, and this can help.</p>

<p>Batteries in 2025 are a lot better than they were in 2015. That's good because the devices are also a lot more power-hungry than they were in 2015. But it does create a situation where it seems like battery development is stagnant. If you develop a battery that has double the density (ability to store a set amount of power), you can cut its size in half to get the same result. Companies don't want to build a phone that's a brick, and a battery that's physically smaller makes that easier.</p>

<p>One day, a company will build mainstream consumer devices that use something different. It might be a graphene-based battery, or use sodium instead of lithium, or even a solid-state battery. There are even companies exploring the use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/gadgets/article/3253660/how-samsung-apple-honor-and-more-are-pushing-smartphone-battery-tech-next-level">nuclear power to build a battery that lasts 50 years</a> once it's charged.</p><p>I am fascinated by all this, and I love to nerd out reading about advances in battery density and efficiency. I can't wait until we see technology like solid-state battery development for small devices that makes our current tech look terrible in comparison.</p>

<p>I also know that none of us wants to pay even more for a phone. They are already expensive, with some models hitting that $2,000 price point, so adding another $100 because of the R&D costs of a new battery type will never fly.</p><p>Unfortunately, faster charging is the best solution we have right now. It won't always be that way because EV companies will usher in some sort of new battery tech that lasts longer and isn't cost-prohibitive. Until then, we want to spend less time with a cord hanging off the end of our phone, so faster charging speeds are what we get.</p><p>As long as everything is done in a way that's safe, this isn't a problem, though in the long run, it does shorten the lifespan of the battery itself.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-122">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Microsoft has brought in marketing heavyweight Mark D’Arcy (ex-Meta, ex-Time Warner) to its Copilot team.</li><li>D’Arcy reports directly to Mustafa Suleyman, who’s betting big on building smarter AI.</li><li>Microsoft is betting D’Arcy can help flip the script and give Copilot a voice that clicks with everyday users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Microsoft’s AI department has roped in Mark D’Arcy, a seasoned marketing executive who cut his teeth at Meta and Time Warner, to help shape the future of Copilot AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-hires-former-meta-marketing-exec-work-copilot-ai" target="_blank">The Information</a> reports.</p><p>The move signals Microsoft’s push to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-default-assistant-beta-rollout">make Copilot not just smart</a>, but also the kind of AI assistant you’d actually want to shoot the breeze with.</p><p>D’Arcy has spent a decade at Meta helping big brands create eye-catching campaigns across Facebook, Instagram, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>. Before that, he was the chief creative officer at Time Warner.</p>
<h2 id="from-ads-to-ai-2">From ads to AI</h2>
<p>Now he is rolling up his sleeves at Microsoft, reporting directly to Mustafa Suleyman, who is in charge of the company’s consumer AI division.</p><p>Suleyman has been vocal about crafting an AI that’s more empathetic than your average cold, calculating bot. Microsoft’s Copilot might not be as famous as ChatGPT (yet), but the software giant has been making moves. You can find it built into Windows, Bing, and Edge, and Microsoft even dropped a Super Bowl ad last year to get it on people’s radar.</p><p>Still, Copilot’s market share is sitting under 5%, while OpenAI’s ChatGPT is dominating with over 80%, based on Similarweb's data, as noted by The Information.</p><p>That’s where D’Arcy comes in. His mission is to make Copilot more relatable.</p>

<p>D’Arcy is stepping in to get Microsoft’s engineers, designers, and ad folks rowing in the same direction. At the top of his list is giving Copilot the marketing juice it needs to really take off.</p><p>Last month, Microsoft rolled out some fresh upgrades to Copilot, including a new feature that remembers key stuff from your past chats.</p><p>D’Arcy hasn’t said much publicly, but behind the scenes, he’s expected to work closely with designers and engineers to help Copilot find its voice. It’s a big bet, but with all the tech giants racing to win the AI race, Microsoft is clearly hoping that giving Copilot some heart and style will help it stand out in the crowd.</p>
