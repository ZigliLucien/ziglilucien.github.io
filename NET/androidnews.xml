Since you can't easily use an Apple Watch with an Android phone or vice versa, the decision largely rests upon which ecosystem you've already invested in.</p><p>However, if you're wondering how the Series 11 stacks up against the Pixel Watch 4, we have you covered. After all, there <em>is</em> a way to use an Apple Watch without daily driving an iPhone, so Android users can use the Series 11 as their smartwatch if they really want to. Let's break down all the differences between the latest Apple Watch Series 11 and the Google Pixel Watch 4.</p><h2 id="apple-watch-series-11-vs-google-pixel-watch-4-design-and-display-2">Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Google Pixel Watch 4: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PiFcBrBww44uiawZ7NXyri" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-2" alt="The Apple Watch Series 11 display shown at multiple angles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PiFcBrBww44uiawZ7NXyri.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Neither Apple nor Google deviated significantly from their typical smartwatch design language when creating the Series 11 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a>. They resemble their predecessors closely, but are distinct from one another. Apple Watches tend to sport a mostly square design with a cover glass and chassis that are slightly curved. Meanwhile, Pixel Watch models feature a "waterdrop" design with a circular shape and curved glass that seamlessly integrates into the chassis.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel Watch 4 looks more minimalist and dainty than the Series 11. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">Apple Watch Series 11</a> is available in either 42mm or 46mm case sizes, whereas the Pixel Watch 4 is offered in 41mm or 45mm case sizes. Although the Pixel Watch is more compact on the wrist, it's much thicker, measuring 12.3mm compared to the Apple Watch's 9.7mm thickness.</p><p>The weight between the two watches is nearly identical, with about a gram separating the non-LTE versions of Series 11 and Pixel Watch 4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3895px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xxECTZggiFniCMYYhC5Prb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-colors-and-sizes-2" alt="Three Pixel Watch 4 models next to each other in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xxECTZggiFniCMYYhC5Prb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3895" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Apple Watch Series 11 is decidedly more premium, with both aluminum and titanium case options available. Google only sells the Pixel Watch 4 in either matte or polished aluminum. There are also more colors and band configurations on the Apple Watch side, and the Series 11 has the advantage of being backwards-compatible with all prior bands within their size bloc (38mm, 40mm, 41mm, 42mm bands are interchangeable; 42mm, 44mm, 45mm, 46mm, 49mm bands are interchangeable).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NkndnC6F4UVpJ8aA3gX28j" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-3" alt="The Apple Watch Series 11 display shown at multiple angles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NkndnC6F4UVpJ8aA3gX28j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4's display is now domed to match the cover glass and is brighter than the Series 11 with a peak brightness rating of 3,000 nits. By comparison, the Apple Watch Series 11 has the advantage of supporting wide-angle OLED technology, which should make it easier to view off-angle than the Pixel Watch 4. The Series 11 display is also slightly higher in resolution, with a pixel density of 326ppi compared to 320ppi on the Pixel Watch 4.</p><p>In terms of durability, the titanium Series 11 uses a sapphire crystal covering, and the aluminum Series 11 uses Ion-X glass. Ion-X is more crack-resistant, while sapphire crystal is more scratch-resistant. Google has Custom Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the Pixel Watch 4 for scratch and crack protection. Additionally, both watches are swimproof and rated for 5ATM.</p><h2 id="apple-watch-series-11-vs-google-pixel-watch-4-hardware-and-specs-2">Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Google Pixel Watch 4: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ngu94MvMgAtT8i8i2x8R25" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-BPM" alt="Blood pressure monitoring on the Apple Watch Series 11." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ngu94MvMgAtT8i8i2x8R25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From a hardware perspective, both smartwatches will be plenty fast. The Apple Watch Series 11 is powered by the S10 chip, a system-in-package processor that includes a dual-core processor and a quad-core Neural Engine. Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 4 includes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a> chip with a Cortex-M55 co-processor.</p><p>Google's leveraging of the co-processor for certain tasks helped it improve battery life for the Pixel Watch 4. The smaller version of the Pixel Watch 4 now lasts up to 30 hours, while the larger model can run for up to 40 hours. That's longer, at least on paper, than the Series 11, which is rated for 24 hours of battery life. It's worth noting that in the past, you could get more battery life out of Apple Watches and Pixel Watches than officially claimed.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Specs</p></th><th  ><p>Apple Watch Series 11</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 4</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>watchOS 26</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>CPU</p></td><td  ><p>S10 chip with 64‑bit dual-core processor; quad-core Neural Engine</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 Gen 2, Cortex M55 co-processor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>Wide-angle OLED, LTPO3 display, 416 by 496 pixels, 1220 sq mm display area, 326ppi, up to 2,000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>Actua 360 AMOLED LTPO display, 320ppi</p><p>3,000 nits, 1-60Hz refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM / Storage</p></td><td  ><p>1GB (unconfirmed) + 64GB</p></td><td  ><p>2GB + 32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>L1 GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, and BeiDou, RedCap for 5G and LTE, Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n), 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth 5.3, Second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (optional), dual-frequency GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic, Satellite SOS, </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Electrical heart sensor, third‑generation optical heart sensor, Blood oxygen sensor, Temperature sensor, Compass, Always‑on altimeter, High‑g accelerometer, High dynamic range gyroscope, Ambient light sensor, Depth gauge to 6 meters, Water temperature sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Compass, altimeter, barometer, magnetometer, 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light, multi-path optical heart rate sensor, cEDA, SpO2, ECG, far field skin temperature sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 24 hours, up to 38 hours in Low Power Mode</p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 325mAh, 30 hours with AOD, 48 hours with Battery Saver</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 455mAh, 40 hours with AOD, 72 hours with Battery Saver</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 80% charge in about 30 minutes</p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 15 minutes to 50%, 25 minutes to 80%, 45 minutes to 100%</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 15 minutes to 50%, 30 minutes to 80%, 60 minutes to 100%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Aluminum or titanium</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>Ion‑X front glass with 2x scratch resistance (aluminum cases) OR sapphire front crystal (titanium cases)</p><p>5ATM, IP6X</p></td><td  ><p>Custom Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Band</p></td><td  ><p>Multiple band options</p></td><td  ><p>Active (fluoroelastomer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>42mm x 39mm x 9.7mm / 46mm x 39mm x 9.7mm </p></td><td  ><p>41 x 41 x 12.3mm / 45 x 45 x 12.3mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight (w/out band)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm: </strong>30.3 grams </p><p><strong>46mm:</strong> 37.8 grams</p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 31g</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 36.7g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Aluminum:</strong> Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray, Jet Black</p><p><strong>Titanium:</strong> Gold, Natural, Slate</p></td><td  ><p>Matte Black, Polished Silver, Champagne Gold (41mm), Satin Moonstone (45mm)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Apple hasn't confirmed the amount of memory onboard the Apple Watch Series 11, but it does provide 64GB of storage. That's extra space for apps, workouts, music, podcasts, and more. The Pixel Watch 4 has 2GB of memory but only 32GB of storage.</p><p>Additionally, the Series 11's cellular model supports 5G and LTE, becoming one of the first smartwatches to do so. You can equip the Pixel Watch 4 with cellular, but you'll only have LTE, not 5G. On the other hand, the Pixel Watch 4 features satellite connectivity, whereas Apple requires you to purchase the Ultra 3 for that capability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ejrZiuxRvyc3BGPxe4bRDb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-charger-misaligned-indicator" alt="Pixel Watch 4 on a charger indicating that the alignment is off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ejrZiuxRvyc3BGPxe4bRDb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple hasn't changed its watch charger in a decade of making smartwatches, yet Google is on its third charger in four generations. That isn't great for compatibility. However, the smaller Pixel Watch 4 does charge slightly faster than the Series 11, reaching 80% in just 25 minutes. The larger Pixel Watch 4 and both Series 11 models need 30 minutes of charging to hit 80%.</p><h2 id="apple-watch-series-11-vs-google-pixel-watch-4-fitness-and-software-2">Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Google Pixel Watch 4: Fitness and software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ypSSUM6XWHFPMFJJp8Vg8i" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-1" alt="The Apple Watch Series 11 display shown at multiple angles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ypSSUM6XWHFPMFJJp8Vg8i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple seems to have the advantage in fitness and health features, both in hardware and software. The software experience is sound with Apple Fitness, which has excellent workout tracking and features like Training Load. Best of all, the entire experience is subscription-free — you'll only have to pay for Apple Fitness Plus if you want guided workout videos; no features are hidden behind that paywall.</p><p>Some Pixel Watch 4 features are hidden behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium subscription</a>, which costs $10 per month. The core experience is free, though, and built upon the Fitbit ecosystem. The watch can track over 40 different types of workouts, and now has dual-band GPS, like the Series 11, for more accurate tracking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3785px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iB9nkn9FxYycbXG4kUJGdb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Fitbit-Quick-Start-Tile" alt="Pixel Watch 4 Fitbit Quick Start Tile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iB9nkn9FxYycbXG4kUJGdb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3785" height="2129" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While both watches support the standard heart rate, temperature, ECG, and blood-oxygen readings, Apple takes a step forward with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-hypertension-alerts-just-put-every-smartwatch-rival-on-notice">blood pressure monitoring</a> on the Series 11.

The fitness and health experience on watchOS 26 is more robust and built out than the one in Wear OS 6, which relies on Fitbit and requires a subscription for full functionality.</p><p>The two sizes of Series 11 smartwatches are also bigger than their respective Pixel Watch 4 counterparts, and the Apple Watch hardware is more premium, with titanium case options available.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that Google has a clear edge in the voice assistant category. The Pixel Watch 4 is powered by Gemini, which can handle basic Assistant tasks and general AI queries.

Getting you started in all of this is Amazon's new Fire TV Stick 4K Select. Its specifications state the new stick is focusing on 4K televisions with "vibrant quality" and HDR10 Plus support. Amazon states apps on the stick launch fast, but that performance boost reportedly comes from its new custom software, VegaOS.</p><p>VegaOS enters the Fire TV Stick 4K Select as the substitute for Android, as Amazon shifts away from it. This new OS is reportedly "responsive and highly efficient," capable of streaming everything you'd want and supporting Xbox Gaming, Luna, and Alex Plus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:621px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.62%;"><img id="4GZvMVtNKdmt2Dn7DuGMeB" name="amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-select" alt="The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Select is the company's newest stick with VegaOS, a faster, lighter weight system over Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4GZvMVtNKdmt2Dn7DuGMeB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="621" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-announces-fire-tv-stick-4k-select-the-first-non-android-based-fire-tv-running-vega-os/">AFTVNews</a> went into a little more detail about the newest stick, stating that VegaOS makes the 4K Select much more lightweight (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/30/amazon-fire-tv-android-vega-os-switch/">9to5Google</a>). The 4K Select only has 1GB of RAM and reportedly "doesn't have as much memory overhead" like the old Android-based stick.</p><p>The new Fire TV Stick 4K Select is now available for pre-order on Amazon, starting at $39.99.</p><h2 id="your-new-favorite-spot-in-the-house-2">Your new favorite spot in the house</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.96%;"><img id="cQjsXmgDFa67hAGV9RoFHd" name="amazon-fire-tv-new-alexa-plus-launch" alt="A model watching their Amazon Fire TV with the remote close by, speaking to Alexa Plus." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cQjsXmgDFa67hAGV9RoFHd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1112" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Joining the 4K Select stick are two new Fire TV launches from Amazon: the Omni QLED Series and the 2-Series & 4-Series.</p><p>Starting with the former, the Omni QLED series is available in 50" and 75" options and are reportedly 60% brighter than the brand's previous products. Lighter and darker tones should appear more vibrant and bold when watching your favorite shows and movies. Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus Adaptive Technology are included in these two QLED series TV sizes, alongside a processor that's 40% faster.</p><p>There are some smarts with this Omni QLED series, as Amazon states the TV can "adjust its colors" based on your lighting situation. Additionally, it can turn on when you enter the room (Omnisense Tech), and Alexa Plus is right there in the TV, ready for you to speak.</p><p>The Omni QLED series starts at $479.99.</p><p>For the 2-Series and 4-Series (32" and 55"), Amazon says the former rocks HD quality, leaving 4K to the latter. Both models are a little faster than before, with the same Omnisense that you'd find on the Omni QLED series.

Alexa Plus is featured across every new TV and the 4K Select stick announced by Amazon today. It states users can converse with the AI to get you into your content on Prime Video, Netflix, HBO Max, and more services.</p><p>However, Alexa Plus can do a little more, as users can ask the AI about specific actors seen in their show or movie, or learn about where the content was filmed. When it comes to gameday, Alexa Plus can give you score updates, player stats, and more across platforms that typically stream sports games. Amazon stresses the "natural" part of Alexa Plus, stating users can speak normally to the AI and find their personalized results rather quickly.</p><p>Other features on its newest TVs include a "pick up where you left off" row for content, more awareness about live sports/TV, a channel guide, and a wishlist for entertainment.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While most competitors like Apple’s AirTag or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-review">Samsung’s SmartTag</a> rotate identifiers and use stronger privacy protections, Tile relies on partial rotation that only happens under specific conditions — every 15 minutes when near the owner’s phone or once a day if separated.</p><p>Meanwhile, the static MAC address never changes, effectively acting as a beacon anyone can lock onto with basic scanning tools.</p><p>This lack of encryption means stalkers with even modest technical know-how could use off-the-shelf antennas or Bluetooth sniffers to trace someone’s movements in real time. Beyond that, researchers warn that Tile’s own infrastructure could theoretically be used to build long-term maps of user behavior, raising deeper questions about how much control the company has over people’s location data.</p><p>The vulnerabilities were first disclosed to Tile’s parent company, Life360, in late 2024, but while the company claims improvements have been made, details on exactly what was fixed remain vague.</p><h2 id="anti-theft-mode-backfires-2">Anti-Theft Mode backfires</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A9WeWxWbkiwaWv3ZWzUE6H" name="Tile Mate (Pink Punch)_ Backpack.jpg" alt="The new Tile Mate (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A9WeWxWbkiwaWv3ZWzUE6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Life360)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One complicating factor is Tile’s “Anti-Theft Mode.” Rolled out as a way to make trackers invisible to scans, the feature requires users to upload government ID and selfies, while also agreeing to a clause that lets Tile share their information with law enforcement — even without a subpoena — if misuse is suspected.</p><p>The company has even tied a $1 million fine to confirmed cases of abuse. While this might sound like a deterrent, critics say the feature strips away key safeguards. When Anti-Theft Mode is enabled, Tile tags no longer show up in the Scan & Secure feature, making it easier for malicious actors to plant trackers on unsuspecting people without detection.</p><p>Researchers also demonstrated that attackers could record a Tile signal and replay it elsewhere, effectively spoofing a person’s location and potentially framing them.</p><p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787836/tile-trackers-stalking-research-unencrypted" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Tile insists it takes security seriously, pointing to ongoing bug bounty programs and ethical hacker collaborations through HackerOne. But until the company demonstrates meaningful fixes, the burden falls on users.</p><p>Experts recommend keeping firmware and app versions up to date, avoiding Anti-Theft Mode unless absolutely necessary, and considering alternatives like Apple or Google’s trackers, which employ stronger privacy protections.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Believe it or not, the choice is pretty easy. If you need a pair of glasses or sunglasses for all-day wear, Oakley Meta HSTN are the way to go. Those who need something exclusive to workouts and fitness, with top-tier Garmin and Strava integration to match, should pick the Oakley Meta Vanguard.</p><p>There is a bit more to it than that, so let's break down all the differences between these two styles of Oakley Meta smart glasses.</p><h2 id="oakley-meta-vanguard-vs-oakley-meta-hstn-pricing-and-availability-2">Oakley Meta Vanguard vs Oakley Meta HSTN: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="VA476hFjCwHij8qkptswae" name="Meta-2025-new-glasses-2" alt="Three Oakley Meta HSTN, three Oakley Meta Vanguard, and three Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), along with cases, sitting atop a table in various styles, along with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses in front of them all." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VA476hFjCwHij8qkptswae.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2223" height="1250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> was announced at Meta Connect and are set for release on Oct. 21, 2025.

They're also based upon popular and longtime Oakley styles — Sphaera and HSTN. So, while tech enthusiasts might not appreciate the Oakley Meta frames, the broader group of mainstream Oakley fans might love them.</p><p>Vanguard is designed to only be worn in certain situations, like while outdoors or working out. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-glasses-prescription-limitations-and-workaround">no clear, prescription, or Transition lenses available for Vanguard</a>, which further cements the positioning of the smart glasses as outdoor-focused. They are large, with a hinge-to-hinge length of 136mm and a lens height of 59mm.</p><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard are heavier than the HSTN style, weighing 66 grams. However, they'll likely be more comfortable and secure than the HSTNs. This is because the Vanguard style includes a silicone nose pad for grip and tight arms that'll rest securely against your head.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QnmfTTrc76kMufv7v5DjY" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-01" alt="A pair of warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with gold PRIZM lenses in a peach tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QnmfTTrc76kMufv7v5DjY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are more versatile, with a subdued design language compared to Vanguard.

At 53 grams, the Meta HSTN smart glasses should be more comfortable for all-day wear than the activity-focused Vanguard version.</p><p>Both pairs of smart glasses have the same camera, but Vanguard positions it between the two lenses. This might create a better POV experience for videos. Meanwhile, the HSTN model has the camera positioned beside the right lens. On the left side, there's an LED status indicator that lets others know when you're recording or snapping photos.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="P5jsrQT8PkTvEic94joEEE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-back-view" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses from the back, showing the displays, nose guards, and Oakley Meta logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P5jsrQT8PkTvEic94joEEE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notably, the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses are rated for IP67 certification against dust and water ingress.

Both pairs of smart glasses can also record 3K video at 30 FPS, and presumably, Vanguard will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review">the same or better video stabilization as HSTN</a>. They have 32GB of onboard storage, which translates to over 1,000 photos or over 100 30-second video recordings.</p><p>Additionally, Oakley Meta Vanguard and HSTN have two open-air speakers, but they're not identical. Vanguard's speakers are six decibels louder than the ones inside HSTN, and Meta claims you can hear them in up to 30 MPH winds.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard</p></th><th  ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3K (~2300 x 3100) at 30 fps (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3K (~2300 x 3100) at 30 fps (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP67</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Open ear</p></td><td  ><p>Open ear</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Interface</p></td><td  ><p>Touchpad on side, Meta AI for voice and camera</p></td><td  ><p>Touchpad on side, Meta AI for voice and camera</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>5-mic Array</p></td><td  ><p>5-mic Array</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 1000+ photos</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 1000+ photos</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 9 hours per charge</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 hours per charge. 50 minutes of record time at 1080p.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 36 hours</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 48 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Prescription lens support</p></td><td  ><p>None</p></td><td  ><p>-6.00 to +4.00</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>66g</p></td><td  ><p>53g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both glasses are compatible with iOS and Android via the Meta AI companion app. They use Bluetooth 5.3 for pairing and Wi-Fi 6 for updates and media transfer.

Oakley Meta Vanguard are the pinnacle of specialization — they're set to be absolutely excellent for workouts, training, and fitness, but probably not much else. Like the non-smart Oakley Sphaera sunglasses they're based on, Vanguard is intended to be used outdoors during physical activity, not all-day wear.</p><p>That said, if you're a runner, hiker, or biker who wants smart capabilities on your face, Oakley Meta Vanguard could be your best option. With Meta AI, Garmin Connect, and Strava integration, you can chat with your smart glasses about your pace or progress during your run hands-free. The open-air speakers for music listening and a camera for recording are added bonuses.</p><p>For people who want something sportier than Ray-Ban but more versatile than Vanguard, there's Oakley Meta HSTN. These have many of the same internals as Vanguard but can go more places, with prescription and Transition lenses available.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cd8f6155-ced0-4d55-b8b1-5aaba33a58ab">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oJJcvh3QpFmQGwK6KzyWmB.jpg' alt="An official product render of Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses with black frames and 24K PRIZM lenses"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta Vanguard</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best for athletes</strong></em></p><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard are clearly the superior option for runners, hikers, and bikers.

The new version replaces the rigid, blocky color divisions with a smooth gradient blend, resulting in a more modern and fluid look.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/gradient-g-logo-design/" target="_blank">says</a> this update shows its growing focus on AI. The new gradient, which blends red, yellow, green, and blue, matches the look now seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> and other AI-related branding.</p><p>Although subtle, the new design also aims to enhance the logo's appearance at smaller sizes (such as favicons and app icons). The smoother transitions reduce visual hard edges and help the logo sit more harmoniously next to other app icons.</p><p>The change first appeared in the Google app’s iOS version and on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. Soon after, the Android version (via Google app version 16.18) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/12/google-icon-update/" target="_blank">adopted it too</a>. On the web and within some Android environments, the old version still lingers, though that’s expected to change.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google Home’s logo was quietly updated to match the new gradient aesthetic, at least in the iOS version of the app.</p><h2 id="wordmark-stays-put-2">Wordmark stays put</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:677px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.32%;"><img id="mKg5C37nsDWJQTWzbNpZRU" name="Google-logo-gradient" alt="Google's new gradient G logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mKg5C37nsDWJQTWzbNpZRU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="677" height="361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nevertheless, Google left its wordmark alone, so the familiar “Google” lettering stays the same for now. The update focuses on the “G” icon, which serves as a key visual for the brand.</p><p>Also consistent is the brand’s commitment to its four signature colors. The difference: instead of hard boundaries, those hues now flow into each other.</p><p>This redesign may be seen as a smart play: the tweak feels evolutionary rather than disruptive.</p><p>Going forward, we’ll have to wait and see whether logos for Gmail, Maps, Chrome, and others will also go the gradient route. But given how the new “G” is being positioned, it’s hard to imagine those staying rigidly block-colored forever.</p> ]]></dc:content>

So if you're looking to switch to Garmin or upgrade your current watch, we'd say you should either start here or accept that you'll have to spend more for a more premium Venu or Forerunner model.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This program is designed to gather sensor data from the Pixel Watch and pair it with user-submitted information to test how well the wearable can flag elevated blood pressure levels.</p><p>Participants who enroll in the study will be asked to answer a short questionnaire and allow the watch to passively collect health data. For a smaller group, Google may take the experiment further by providing a 24-hour blood pressure monitor for direct comparison. These users will need to wear the cuff, send it back afterward, and in return will receive about $50 for their time.</p><h2 id="battery-trade-off-2">Battery trade-off</h2><p>Since the study relies on continuous data collection, Google has noted that battery drain may increase while the feature is active.</p><p>Instead of giving exact blood pressure numbers like a regular cuff, the Pixel Watch would probably look for signs that suggest high blood pressure. This is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-hypertension-alerts-just-put-every-smartwatch-rival-on-notice">similar to Apple's approach</a>, which aims to alert users if they might need to see a doctor, not to replace medical equipment.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ndbQgnXgyhGHbNrDRhhL3n" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-3-hypertension-alert-photo" alt="A mostly black-and-white photo of a person wearing the Apple Watch Ultra 3 — with a gold case — with a "Possible Hypertension" pop-up shown in full color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ndbQgnXgyhGHbNrDRhhL3n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At this stage, there’s no guarantee that the feature will reach all users in a finished form, but this study signals a serious push by Google to explore preventive health tools through wearables.</p><p>If successful, hypertension screening would slot neatly into the Pixel Watch’s growing set of health and safety features. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, for instance, recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/loss-of-pulse-detection-is-finally-rolling-out-to-pixel-watch-3-users-in-the-us">rolled out loss of pulse detection in the U.S.</a> after securing FDA clearance. That feature automatically calls emergency services if the watch detects no pulse and the wearer doesn’t respond.</p><p>Alongside this, Google has already layered in tools like Daily Readiness, Cardio Load, and Target Load to give users a clearer picture of their health trends. Hypertension screening would expand this lineup further, tackling a condition that often goes unnoticed until it causes major health issues.</p><p>Whether the feature launches broadly will depend on how well the study goes, but the direction is clear: Google wants the Pixel Watch to become a serious player in digital health.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This marked the first time that we had seen a modern mobile gaming device with a sliding mechanism since the Sony Xperia Play. Such a device comes with a steep asking price, but you can currently save $100 on the RG Slide from Amazon, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ/?th=1"><strong>it's down to $199 for a limited time</strong></a>.</p><p>With that, you're not only getting a dedicated gaming device with a nostalgic design, but it's also equipped with a 4.7-inch LTPS display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate. Not only that, but Anbernic managed to squeeze in a 5,000mAh battery that will last for up to six hours on a single charge.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension48="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="cuGm2tyLZbTqg5RUHgMjnm" name="anbernic-rg-slide-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cuGm2tyLZbTqg5RUHgMjnm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anbernic RG Slide: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ/?th=1" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension48="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension25=""><del>$299</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Have you been longing for a modern take on the PSP Go? Anbernic delivered just that with the RG Slide, an Android gaming handheld that features a sturdy sliding mechanism and impressive performance.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension48="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're a sucker for nostalgia and want a gaming handheld that looks like the PSP Go but plays many of your favorite retro and Android games.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want a gaming handheld that offers a bit more power than what the Unisoc T820 in the RG Slide can provide, or you need something a bit more lightweight and pocketable.</p><p>As you'd expect, there's more than one way for you to play some games on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ayaneo-might-bring-back-one-of-the-most-unique-phone-designs-and-im-here-for-it">RG Slide</a>, as you can just stick to the touchscreen if you really wanted to. But after you push the screen upwards, you're immediately greeted with a full set of controls, including dual low-profile joysticks.</p><p>Beneath the intricate sliding mechanism and controls, we have a rather familiar set of specs, starting with the Unisoc T820. This chip was featured in last year's RG406H and RG406V, but has actually been bouncing around since 2022.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fBKxeKNViqzivtUMQiueZn" name="anbernic-rg-slide-ayaneo-pocket-dmg-psp-go" alt="Anbernic RG Slide next to AYANEO Pocket DMG and PSP Go" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fBKxeKNViqzivtUMQiueZn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The T820 is joined by 8GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage, giving you plenty of wiggle room to enjoy a lot of the best Android games. And as for emulation, the T820 is capable of playing up to GameCube, Wii, and PS2, along with a tiny bit of Switch emulation if you're playing lighter titles.</p><p>The most enticing reason to pick up the RG Slide is also the biggest reason why you might want to avoid this handheld. In order to provide a gaming handheld with a sliding mechanism that won't falter, it has to be made of metal, which is exactly what Anbernic has done. On one hand, it's great knowing that you can slide the screen up and down without worrying about it breaking. On the other, this results in a device that is almost twice as heavy as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>.</p><p>Even still, the RG Slide, especially for $100 off, is worth checking out if you have any interest in a modern PSP Go that runs Android and even has a 120Hz display. Plus, we expected other companies to follow Anbernic's suit after the Sony patent expired, but at the time of this writing, the RG Slide remains the only option.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To start, the post alleges that the company could have five Pixel 10a color variants in development for its expected debut. Those variants could include black, blue, dark blue, red, and green.</p><p>The tipster claims that these device colors aren't baseless, as they could line up with a selection of wallpapers that have leaked, too.</p><p>The wallpapers for the Pixel 10a sort of mirror the ones we see for the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 flagship series</a>. The colors are sleek and almost silky in nature, bending across the display, like ribbons.

If true, this would be the third year in a row that Google's mid-range line has done so. Additionally, Google is reportedly also looking into downgrading the device by implementing the older UFS 3.1 storage, instead of rocking UFS 4.0.

Redmagic's Astra was the outlier, with the tablet touting a 9.06-inch OLED panel that made it a fabulous device. If anything, I've been on the lookout for a small Android tablet; we just moved to a new house, and I wanted to set up a smart home dashboard in my living room.</p><p>As much as I enjoy using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad/i-finally-used-the-ipad-mini-and-im-obsessed">iPad mini</a>, I wanted an Android tablet to run Home Assistant, and coincidentally, Xiaomi debuted the Pad Mini at just the right time. The tablet was unveiled alongside the 15T and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-15t-pro-review">15T Pro</a>, and I've been using it for the better part of two weeks now. Coming in at $429, the Pad Mini undercuts the iPad Mini, but that isn't anything new — Xiaomi has been doing this for over a decade now. The tablet is limited to select Southeast Asian countries, but it should make its way to other regions over the coming months.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4929px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="5P4s9uKQUaEza78m4bkB2W" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5P4s9uKQUaEza78m4bkB2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4929" height="2776" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-is-a-convincing-ipad-air-clone-that-costs-half-as-much">Xiaomi Pad 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-pro-review">Pad 7 Pro</a>, the Pad Mini has a metallic chassis with a minimalist design, and the smaller size makes it easier to use anywhere. Build quality is good, and while the grey variant I'm using doesn't stand out visually, I'm glad Xiaomi didn't go overboard with the design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NNSN9ik2ipYeV2x3f3smpV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NNSN9ik2ipYeV2x3f3smpV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pad Mini has flat sides, but there are subtle bevels that make it easy to hold and use, and at 326g, it is light enough that there aren't any problems in this area. It is heavier than the iPad mini, but you're also getting a bigger panel. The bezels are chunkier than most phones, but they're uniform.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="u8PeJkwsKZFF3oer3AyBCW" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u8PeJkwsKZFF3oer3AyBCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Talking about the panel, the 8.8-inch IPS LCD goes up to 165Hz, and that feels like overkill. What's great is that the interface is fluid, and I didn't see any slowdowns whatsoever in the two weeks I used the Pad Mini. The 3K resolution of 3008 x 1880 is plenty adequate, and the tablet is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9400+ platform — the same as the Xiaomi 15T Pro. Clearly, there's no shortage of power, and the few games I played on the Pad Mini ran without any issues.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WEqg5oieRtYgGCrYBZmpLV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WEqg5oieRtYgGCrYBZmpLV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm using the 12GB/512GB variant of the Pad Mini, but it is also available in an 8GB/256GB configuration. It's good to see Xiaomi using UFS 4.1 storage modules on the tablet, and it gets a sizeable 7,500mAh battery that comfortably delivers over 10 hours of screen time without any problems.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CCJVWsbL3pDjWym62rjFjU" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CCJVWsbL3pDjWym62rjFjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 8.8-inch panel has vibrant colors and is calibrated well, and as is the case with most Xiaomi products, you get a good amount of customizability. What I like the most is that Xiaomi's reading mode is intact, allowing you to turn the screen monochrome; this gives the Pad Mini a distinct advantage over the iPad mini when reading ebooks on the device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="V95Pgtcyz2y5UQEj9azKuV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V95Pgtcyz2y5UQEj9azKuV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another differentiator is the side-mounted USB-C port. The Pad Mini has the usual USB-C connector at the bottom, but you get a secondary port on the left side, and this makes it doubly convenient to charge the tablet when you're using it. Xiaomi also bundles a 67W charger in the box — unlike the 15T Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kXHKkEYR4uvytDAFQoPjYQ" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kXHKkEYR4uvytDAFQoPjYQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's delightful to use the Pad Mini; the small tablet is easy to hold one-handed, and the panel has good color vibrancy and excellent brightness.

However, a ring lacks flexibility, so even a slight battery expansion can press painfully and dangerously against the finger.</p><p>While the Galaxy Ring’s swelling cases haven’t involved fires or explosions, the safety concerns are still significant.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-response-is-quiet-so-far-2">Samsung's response is quiet (so far)</h2><p>Samsung has responded quietly so far.

With active noise cancellation, a wild 100-hour battery claim, modular parts, and high-resolution audio support, it feels like CMF wants to shake up the under-$100 headphone category.</p><p>The design stands out immediately. Instead of glossy touch controls, the Headphone Pro uses a multifunction roller for volume, playback, and noise cancellation. There's also an 'Energy Slider' to adjust bass and treble on the fly, without needing an app. This setup is similar to what Nothing used in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Headphone 1</a>.</p><h2 id="modular-approach-2">Modular approach</h2><p>There’s also a customizable button that you can program for specific shortcuts. The headphones are modular too, with swappable ear cushions that come in multiple colors like bright orange and light green, adding both comfort and personality. Replacement pads cost around $25, making it easy to freshen them up or change the look.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1497px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9FmokWwpNtjB2erPWiEY97" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-on-head" alt="CMF Headphone Pro worn over head" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9FmokWwpNtjB2erPWiEY97.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1497" height="842" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood, CMF isn’t cutting corners. The Headphone Pro uses 40mm dynamic drivers with nickel-plated diaphragms and a 16.5mm copper coil inside a dual-chamber setup, all aimed at reducing distortion and widening the soundstage. They’re Hi-Res Audio certified and support LDAC for high-bitrate wireless streaming, while also offering a 3.5mm wired option.</p><p>A “Personal Sound” feature fine-tunes the EQ based on your ear shape and hearing profile. As for noise cancellation, CMF promises hybrid adaptive ANC with up to 40dB reduction that automatically adjusts depending on your environment.</p><h2 id="monster-battery-life-2">Monster battery life</h2><p>Battery life might be the headline feature: with ANC off, you get up to 100 hours of playback. Even with ANC on, CMF claims an impressive 50 hours, which is more than enough to cover a week’s worth of commutes or long-haul flights.</p><p>Charging is fast as well. A 5-minute charge gives you about 4 hours of playback, and a full charge takes around two hours with USB-C. If needed, you can also charge the headphones directly from your smartphone using a USB-C to USB-C cable.</p><p>Connectivity checks most boxes you’d expect in 2025: Bluetooth 5.4, multipoint pairing, Fast Pair for Android, Swift Pair for Windows, and full iOS support. That versatility makes it easier to switch between devices. For call quality, the headphones include an AI noise reduction system to cut down on background noise during conversations.</p><p>The CMF Headphone Pro comes in dark gray, light gray, and light green, with ear cushion colors to mix things up. They’re available now in Europe and the UK, while U.S. buyers will have to wait until October 7, 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But there are a few other features of the ORICO K20 Mini that I've been rather enjoying, least of which is the built-in MagSafe compatibility.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension48="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Magnetic-External-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B0DNMTKFN7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="TJ4RSKLiJXoLkTzQViTJD" name="orico-k20-mini-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TJ4RSKLiJXoLkTzQViTJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: </strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension48="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$109.99</del> <strong>$99.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The days of your phone featuring a microSD are long gone, and have been for quite some time.

Thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> lineup has mostly arrived (we're still waiting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>), which includes the necessary magnets to use these kinds of accessories without needing adapters. Hopefully, other companies will soon follow suit, but at least there are workarounds at my disposal.</p><p>In addition to the ultra slim design, the K20 Mini is also fairly rugged thanks to its Aluminum Alloy shell that doesn't interfere with your phone's signal, while also being able to withstand a few bumps and bruises. Plus, ORICO's portable SSD can reach up to 2,000MB/s transfer speeds and includes a compatible cable in the box.</p><p>ORICO offers the K20 Mini in three different sizes, ranging from 512GB to 2TB, but for just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Magnetic-External-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B0DNMTKFN7/">under $100</a>, the 1TB offers the best bang for the buck of the trio. We suspect this deal won't last forever, so if you're you want something to help you forget about wanting a microSD card slot, take the K20 Mini for a spin.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Add in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">S25 Edge</a> and the newest S25 FE, and you have something for everyone.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy phones offer one thing consistently: <strong>performance</strong>. You might not like some of the features or a few things about the way they look and feel, but when a phone gets the "Galaxy" name, it is Samsung's best-in-class offering. Both the small Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 FE fit the bill here. They're damn fine phones.</p><p>But they do have their differences. Here's what the standard Galaxy S25 simply does better.</p><p><strong>It has a much better display</strong>. I'm starting here because this is the most important difference. The S25 FE has a good screen, a 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED panel. The regular Galaxy S25, though, has one that's better; it's denser, so it will look clearer, it's brighter, and it has full HDR support. These differences might sound minor, but the display is what you're looking at 100% of the time you're using your phone. Nothing is more important than the display.</p><p><strong>The chip is better</strong>. The Galaxy S25 comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm SM8750-AB, the Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. The FE uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Samsung Exynos 2400 S5E9945</a>. Both are more than powerful enough to do all your phone things, but the Snapdragon makes a big difference when it comes to battery life and network connectivity. If you're into benchmarks, the Snapdragon destroys the Exynos, too.</p><p><strong>It has a better camera system</strong>. The telephoto lens on the standard S25 is a better piece of hardware, offering a higher zoom and better focal length. If you want to stand back and zoom in, you'll see the difference.</p><p><strong>The fingerprint scanner is better</strong>. A small nitpick that really bothers me. I hate in-screen sensors, but the S25 FE uses an optical sensor while the standard version uses an ultrasonic variant.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-s-great-about-the-s25-fe"><span>What's great about the S25 FE</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The S25 FE has a few things you won't find on the standard version, even though it's a little cheaper. The most notable features and specs:</p><p><strong>It's bigger</strong>. At one time, every company was trying to make phones as tiny as they could. Not today! For a lot of people, a bigger phone is better, and the FE is big without being too big. A 6.7-inch·2340x1080px display is the sweet spot for a lot of folks, and the FE nails it when it comes to size.</p><p><strong>The battery</strong>. It's bigger, almost 20% bigger. The FE has a 4,900 mAh battery compared to the 4,000 mAh battery on the standard S25. While the more efficient Qualcomm chip on the standard S25 means it doesn't last longer most of the time, the FE's extra capacity is the reason why. That's rare to see when comparing an Exynos phone to a Qualcomm phone, so the extra battery was a great choice.</p><p><strong>The update cycle. </strong>The FE ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> and will get seven years of updates. Since the original S25 debuted so much earlier, it shipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and also gets 7 years of updates. When all the dust settles, the FE <em>could</em> get one extra platform update because of when it was released.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>You're going to be happy with either of these phones. They are very similar to each other when it comes to features and performance, but the regular S25 has just a bit more to offer.</p><p>I like the better display on the standard S25, and when it comes to network operability, the Qualcomm chip means the standard S25 is not only faster at transferring wireless data, but also has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/wi-fi-7-is-here-but-should-you-care">Wi-Fi 7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">mmWave support</a>, and can connect to more FDD, TDD, and 3G fallback bands that you won't find on the FE. Depending on where you are, this might make a big difference.</p><p>The FE has a bigger display, enough battery power to make it last as long as the regular version (a big win for an Exynos chip!), and charges faster. <strong>More importantly, both phones charge safely.</strong> Samsung learned its lesson and offers the safest methods available when it comes to refueling your battery, since we're monkeys who always <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-is-it-safe-to-use-my-phone-while-im-charging-it">make bad decisions</a>, that matters. 🐵</p><p>I would spend the extra few dollars on the regular S25 because I care about the display quality more than the other differences. But really, this is a toss-up. You'll pay more for the standard S25, but it's worth every penny. So is the FE. Grab either and you're good.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="13ddd301-2157-4ac8-a1b2-3dd08d9f30ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1WWG4M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="HT3UJuEYWHiCkgRjmm34j6" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HT3UJuEYWHiCkgRjmm34j6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1WWG4M?tag=hawk-future-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&ascsubtag=ac-us-5476547492718419391-20" target="_blank" data-dimension112="13ddd301-2157-4ac8-a1b2-3dd08d9f30ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" data-dimension25=""><strong>$650 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Galaxy FE series was designed so that smartphone fans could get the best bang for their buck from Samsung.

The company is calling this an "early preview" of the feature, as its rollout begins for all users. Vibes starts out as a simple feed where you can view videos created by others using its AI software. However, as time goes on, and you begin viewing more videos, Meta states this Vibes feed will become "personalized."</p><p>In Vibes, users will have a few options, such as starting from the basis of their own ideas. Meta states users can create an AI-generated video using content they have. Additionally, if you're digging the Vibes, you can "remix" a video someone else has had the AI create, and make it something different. Before remixing, Meta will deliver a pop-up menu with the following options: Add Music, Change Image, and Change Animation.</p><p>The possibilities right now in Vibes may seem a little basic, but Meta states it's working to improve those options and possibilities. It plans to roll out more "powerful creation tools" in the future.</p><p>Once you're satisfied with your remix, or even your personal idea, users can post it on the Vibes feed. Similarly, you can share your AI-generated video with others through DMs and cross-post that content to your Instagram or Facebook Stories or Reels.</p><p>As Vibe rolls out in the app, Meta states you can also access this new feed via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://meta.ai/"><u>meta.ai</u></a>, as well.</p><h2 id="vibes-joins-discover-2">Vibes joins Discover</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:691px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.83%;"><img id="bvR5H6RAdpbfycd8tvWSLH" name="meta-ai-app-remix-restyle-launch" alt="The Meta AI app rolls out a new "Vibes" feed, packed full of AI-generated videos other have created, as well as a "remix" option that lets you change what others have done." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bvR5H6RAdpbfycd8tvWSLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="691" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta also highlights that its app is capable of working well with its AI glasses, meaning it'll pair well with those new, "enhanced" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses</a>.</p><p>Meta's continued focus on the AI app being a useful tool for its AI smartglasses goes hand-in-hand with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/new-meta-ai-app-provides-llama-4-powered-challenge-to-gemini">the app's original launch</a> earlier this year.

It opened up the door for regular users without a pair of smartglasses to still utilize Meta's AI capabilities.</p><p>This Vibes feed is like the video version of the app's original Discover feed, which hosts prompts that others have created and shared. Similar to that feed, users can, of course, "remix" those prompts (like videos) and turn them into something that's yours.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This members-only sale event is expected to showcase some of the best tech deals of the year, but take note: unlike last July&apos;s four-day Prime Day, this sale is only set to run for 48 hours. </p><h2 id="what-google-pixel-deals-should-i-look-for-during-prime-day-2">What Google Pixel deals should I look for during Prime Day?</h2><p>Prime Day generally showcases the best discounts on newer devices while ignoring most last-gen stuff. This means you should expect to see a ton of great deals on the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL. It&apos;s also worth mentioning that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> are scheduled for release on October 9th (one day after the sale ends), so we could see some updated incentives to preorder. </p><h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-big-deal-days-2">Do I need to be a Prime member to shop during Big Deal Days?</h2><p>Yes! Like all Prime Day sale events, Big Deal Days is exclusive to Prime members. If you haven&apos;t joined yet, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for the 30-day free trial</strong></a> to enjoy all of the benefits of a membership without paying a cent. </p><p>Alternatively, if you&apos;d simply rather not shop at Amazon, be aware that the retailer&apos;s biggest competitors - such as Best Buy and Walmart - are expected to launch their own rival sale events at the same time. These stores typically match Amazon&apos;s prices without requiring any sort of membership. </p> ]]></dc:content>

There are several aspects of Bluetooth that make it an excellent choice for wirelessly connecting a wide range of devices, including audio gear. It's versatile, compatible, and continues to evolve, gaining new features with each iteration, such as Bluetooth 6 and Low Energy (LE) Audio.</p><p>However, there are a few notable limitations that come with using Bluetooth for audio playback on headphones, earbuds, and speakers. Two big ones are range and quality. The average range for common Bluetooth devices (Class 2) is about 33 feet, which isn't much and can be shortened by interference, digital or physical, like walls or floors. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tech-talk-what-is-lossless-audio">attaining lossless quality for music</a> over Bluetooth is near impossible, though emerging codecs like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">AptX Lossless</a> are trying to make it a reality.</p><p>That raises an important question: should we focus on improving Bluetooth or switch to Wi-Fi? Qualcomm is a company that's doing both, developing AptX Lossless over Bluetooth <em>and</em> working on XPAN (Expanded Personal Area Network) over Wi-Fi. It's exciting, but Sonos has been doing Wi-Fi on its speakers for years, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> announced XPAN years ago.</p><p>So, where is Wi-Fi for consumer audio gear, like headphones and earbuds? It's a complex situation, but the future looks bright.</p><h2 id="why-we-need-wi-fi-over-bluetooth-and-how-it-works-2">Why we need Wi-Fi over Bluetooth (and how it works)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU" name="Sonos-Ace-both-colors.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones in black and soft white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Sonos fans expected its Ace headphones to support Wi-Fi like its speakers, but that didn't happen.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many casual audio enthusiasts wonder why Wi-Fi headphones and earbuds haven't gained popularity yet, as evidenced by numerous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/xemeqs/do_wifi_headsets_exist_if_yes_are_they_any_good/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1cxdn6n/why_wifi_headphones_probably_werent_on_the_table/" target="_blank">threads</a>. After all, Wi-Fi speakers are very much a thing, and Sonos has a robust ecosystem of them. Taking that technology and applying it to headphones and earbuds should be easy, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>The perceived simplicity of this goal usually comes from a misunderstanding of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-roam-2-review">how Wi-Fi speakers like Sonos work</a>. When connecting a pair of Bluetooth headphones to your phone, it's your smartphone that streams the music from a service and then separately beams it to those headphones. Your phone is talking to a streaming service over Wi-Fi or data (or playing downloaded content), and subsequently shares the audio with a wireless device over Bluetooth.</p><p>That's not how Wi-Fi speakers like Sonos operate. In this scenario, your phone effectively becomes a remote control for your Sonos speaker, which independently streams music from a service over Wi-Fi. That's how you can remotely control playback on Sonos speakers from across the world, whereas you typically need to be within 33 feet to maintain a Bluetooth connection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zX7NLohYdhCNapzeoVaFqU" name="Sonos-Ace-app-home-theater.jpg" alt="Sonos app showing Ace headphones swap with Sonos Arc." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zX7NLohYdhCNapzeoVaFqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To apply this technology to headphones and earbuds, these consumer audio products must be able to connect to Wi-Fi networks and stream audio independently of an intermediary device, such as a smartphone. That's tricky, because you'd need to cram extra hardware into smaller devices. It might be why Sonos' first pair of headphones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a>, opted for Bluetooth instead of Wi-Fi, unlike the rest of the ecosystem.</p><p>But Wi-Fi has clear advantages over Bluetooth, which is why many audiophiles crave it. The connectivity protocol effectively removes the range limits of Bluetooth — with enough networking hardware and access points, Wi-Fi earbuds could work anywhere that receives your network's signal — and adds high-fidelity audio.</p><h2 id="qualcomm-s-xpan-technology-brings-wi-fi-audio-2">Qualcomm's XPAN technology brings Wi-Fi audio</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YLeJjrVdDsNpV49VeYvXYH" name="Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YLeJjrVdDsNpV49VeYvXYH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro are Qualcomm XPAN earbuds you can buy today.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This technology isn't a fever-dream; it's real and available now in the form of Qualcomm XPAN. It's available on select headphones and earbuds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/xiaomi-buds-5-pro-sound-qualcomm-xpan">like the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro</a>, and extends the range typically provided by Bluetooth by adding your home Wi-Fi network. In practice, it means your buds won't cut out if you walk too far away from your Bluetooth device, since they'll fall back to Wi-Fi.</p><p>Built upon the Snapdragon Sound platform and the S7 series of chips, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/problem-with-qualcomm-s7-sound-xpan-tech">Qualcomm XPAN</a> is trying to make Wi-Fi headphones and earbuds mainstream. There's a long road ahead, but the first consumer audio products to support XPAN were released this year, including the Buds 5 Pro.</p><p>Aside from the extended range, Qualcomm XPAN offers higher-fidelity audio by leveraging a Wi-Fi connection. The mode's maximum quality is 96kHz/24-bit, which is higher than CD-quality. In other words, XPAN technology and supported devices like the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro deliver <em>true</em> wireless lossless audio beyond what conventional Bluetooth offers.</p><p>While 96kHz/24-bit is something you can use with XPAN today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/wi-fi-wireless-earbuds-with-24-bit-hi-res-audio-are-coming-very-soon-confirms-qualcomm" target="_blank">the future is 24-bit/192kHz lossless audio</a>. So, what's in the way of that future becoming reality?</p><h2 id="the-slow-adoption-2">The slow adoption</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="c4pVf3CzYzMxeXJGCBQsEH" name="Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4pVf3CzYzMxeXJGCBQsEH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In some ways, Wi-Fi as an audio connectivity standard comes with just as many pain points as Bluetooth, which may be slowing adoption. The extra hardware needed to make it work could be expensive or open an entirely new can of worms on the research and development side. Plus, using Wi-Fi consumes more battery than Bluetooth, especially when compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">new standards like LE Audio</a>.</p><p>Mainstream earbuds and headphones with Wi-Fi support would need extra chips, a solution to the battery life problem, <em>and </em>a solution to the compatibility problem. While almost everything supports Bluetooth audio these days, Wi-Fi audio compatibility would need to be built from the ground up. For instance, you need a supported phone like the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> to get the full 96Hz/24-bit audio of XPAN.</p><p>Even technologies like Qualcomm XPAN use a mix of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, rather than streaming audio directly over Wi-Fi, like Sonos speakers do. This helps Qualcomm address the battery life problem that would plague true Wi-Fi headphones.</p><p>The hybrid approach, combined with larger internal batteries — the Wi-Fi version of Xiaomi's Buds 5 Pro has a 64mAh battery compared to the 53mAh capacity of the Bluetooth version — helps Qualcomm deliver the same or better battery life as Bluetooth earbuds.</p><p>We haven't seen Wi-Fi headphones and earbuds go mainstream due to technical limitations and compatibility issues, but that might be changing as emerging standards like Qualcomm's XPAN continue to grow.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Everyone is racing to make the best AI phone, but it's really a two-horse race between Samsung and Google. There are pros and cons to choosing either brand, and I've tested the latest features from both Gemini and Galaxy AI. It's clear to me that, if getting the best AI features on your phone is your top priority, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series is the one to go with.</p><p>That's not to say that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> is doing anything worse than the Galaxy S25 — it's just a numbers game. Google is very generous, gifting its best AI features to other Android and iOS devices, whereas Samsung's Galaxy AI suite is exclusive to its own devices. If you use a Galaxy S25, you're still getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">multimodal Gemini Live</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/circle-to-search-gains-real-time-translation">Circle to Search</a>, and AI editing tools in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>. Access to <em>both</em> Google AI and Galaxy AI is a major plus for the Galaxy S25.</p><p>That's partly why I'm intrigued by a Verizon deal that claims to give away a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus/" target="_blank">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> for free, which sounds too good to be true. In some ways, it is — you have to add a line on the Unlimited Ultimate or Unlimited Plus plans. That means it's not <em>completely </em>free, but if you're looking to switch plans or already have one of these Verizon plans, this is a sweet way to get my favorite AI phone for less.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8500c295-5ccc-4f77-894c-2abf4be6dadc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 256GB:  $799.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 256GB:  $799.99" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="DfcXMYkPcazrcyA9X2i5jA" name="samsung galaxy s25 square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfcXMYkPcazrcyA9X2i5jA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="8500c295-5ccc-4f77-894c-2abf4be6dadc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 256GB:  $799.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 256GB:  $799.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$799.99</del> <strong>FREE with eligible data plan at Verizon</strong></a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is one of the best flagships you can buy right now, delivering a 6.2-inch display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset.

Starting with feature availability, devices like the Galaxy S25 have access to Galaxy AI and Gemini, which is an impressive combination. You probably know all about what Gemini can do, but you should also be aware of the great things Samsung is doing on the AI front.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Bar and Brief</a> are both designed to use AI to put relevant items in front of you whenever you need them — think something like an AI-powered version of Apple's Live Activities and Dynamic Island, but for the Galaxy S25 series. These features are neat, but they heavily depend on whether you use supported services, like Samsung apps or Google Maps.</p><p>I find that the simpler <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> tools are more handy, like Object Eraser and Audio Eraser, which perform better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser and Audio Magic Eraser</a> on the Google side of things. Additionally, if you're into wearables, Galaxy AI powers a daily Energy Score and Sleep Score with a Galaxy Ring or Watch. This is especially great when you consider these health insights are completely free, whereas Google has some Pixel Watch features behind a Fitbit Premium subscription.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4KJrf2twULD4748vqe4wCJ" name="Galaxy-S25-On-Device-AI" alt="The 'process data only on device' page in Samsung settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KJrf2twULD4748vqe4wCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Best of all, Samsung has the hardware and software needed to deliver a private and secure experience.

Before you get sucked into the hype of a "free" phone, especially one as good as the Galaxy S25, review the fine print. In this case, be aware that you need to add a line, upgrade, or keep an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan to get the deal.</p><p>The savings that cut the entire retail price of the Galaxy S25 or S25 Plus down to $0 are applied as bill credits over the course of 36 months. If you cancel, switch plans, or upgrade early, you'll be on the hook for the remainder of the phone's cost.</p><p>That might sound scary, but it doesn't have to be, if you know what you're getting. With an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan, you get unlimited talk, text, and data, plus extra perks like mobile hotspot and 5G UW support. Those who already need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans" target="_blank">great wireless plan</a> can get one at Verizon while also snagging a free Galaxy S25 in the process.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Having a strong Gen 2 baseline will be important to Gen 1 owners, who know the capacity will fade with time, as well as first-time buyers.</p><p>So far, the Gen 2s use up about 20% capacity per hour, including one 3K video, frequent Meta AI commands, and high-volume music streaming to combat outdoor ambience. A two-hour run left me at 60% capacity, while a one-hour run the next day left me at 79%.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CFvRdWFjeKiD2zFcPY3PRg" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-selfie" alt="Selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses, sitting indoors on a couch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CFvRdWFjeKiD2zFcPY3PRg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2939px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="K5MQhw73QZzQAo93XyvQsi" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-on-face-close-up" alt="A selfie of Michael Hicks wearing the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K5MQhw73QZzQAo93XyvQsi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2939" height="1653" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are notably thicker. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Using them indoors at a lower volume, with Meta AI commands turned off to conserve power, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s were at 69% after two hours — very efficient! Then, a two-minute phone call and filming my cat in 3K for another minute cut another 8% power, so take that into account.</p><p>I don't believe you could consistently use these for all-day audio streaming, unless you're willing to take them off once or twice for a quick top-off in the charging case. But it's <em>much</em> better than before, and the 50% recharge in 20 minutes helps.</p><p>Overall, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 battery boost makes me much more likely to wear them for an outing or work event, knowing they won't become a pointless face-weight after a couple of hours.</p><h2 id="these-glasses-don-t-feel-that-different-but-they-ll-keep-changing-2">These glasses don't feel THAT different, but they'll keep changing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-glasses-selfie-clear-lenses" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses with Clear lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Around the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> launch in late October, Meta will push several new updates to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s: slow motion and hyperlapse videos, Garmin/ Strava integration for real-time workout stats, "conversation focus" mode to enhance the voice of whomever you're speaking with, and new voice command shortcuts like "Photo" without the Meta AI wake word.</p><p>Meta has also promised that the Ray-Ban Gen 2s will be able to shoot in 1200p resolution at 60 FPS, but the option isn't available yet. Meta has even opened up its "Wearable Device Access Toolkit" so that devs can integrate Meta AI glasses directly with their third-party apps — but we probably won't see the results until 2026 or later.</p><p>Aside from battery life, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s don't feel <em>that</em> different today. But all of the above features make me optimistic that they'll feel more "next-gen" soon.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBL0acIBb2Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>On that note, even though the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses offer "over 2x more pixels" than the last generation for video recording, the difference doesn't feel that stark. You can notice more details and less compression in side-by-side videos if you look closely, at least.</p><p>But Nick, who tested the identical cameras on the Oakley Meta HSTNs, agrees with me that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">image stabilization is fantastic at 1080p</a>, creating a super-smooth, gliding video while running fast that almost recreates the effect of a dolly shot in movies. So I find myself preferring that mode; maybe the 1200p 60FPS mode will feel like a nice, smoother compromise between the two, once that arrives.</p><p>Honestly, I just wish we'd seen a <em>photo</em> quality boost, as well. The unchanged 3024 X 4032 resolution is still great in ideal conditions, but I'd still like to see better low-light quality, color balancing that's not quite so oversaturated, or some kind of optical zoom (if that's feasible in glasses form) when the Gen 3s arrive in a couple of years.</p><h2 id="the-cons-and-nitpicks-that-you-ll-have-to-live-with-2">The cons and nitpicks that you'll have to live with</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wShPAtdgs2J5UNDwjCwYig" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-vs-normal-glasses" alt="Photo of normal Warby Parker glasses sitting atop Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses on a blue-and-white patterned blanket." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wShPAtdgs2J5UNDwjCwYig.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">My normal Warby Parker glasses compared to my Ray-Ban Wayfarers. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With my last Ray-Bans, I wore a "Large" pair that put less pressure on my face but wasn't well-fitted, so it slid down my face while walking (or running, especially). With this pair, I got the Standard size, and now they stay firmly in place for a ten-mile run, no matter how sweaty I get.</p><p><em>That's</em> great, but now that I'm wearing them on consecutive days instead of sporadic weekends, the better fit also puts more pressure on my nose bridge and ears. Even though the Gen 2s only weigh about 2g more — a fair trade-off for the battery boost — not everyone will enjoy that extra weight for long-term wear.</p><p>The design blends in <em>much</em> better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> glasses, and I like their style more than the Oakley HSTNs, but not everyone will agree with me.

I'd love for Meta to offer something similar.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hLZZgrhjS9KfTFuhbzSY6Y" name="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-official-lifestyle-03" alt="An official lifestyle photo of a person wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hLZZgrhjS9KfTFuhbzSY6Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-sold-over-1-million-units-of-ray-ban-smart-glasses-in-2024">millions of people</a> who bought the first Ray-Ban Meta will like the Gen 2s just as much, while anyone turned off by the noticeably thick frames and obvious camera cutouts won't find anything that different to tempt them.</p><p>I gravitate toward the sporty Vanguard design with its IP67 water resistance and nose pads, but my Transitions Ray-Bans are better suited for any environment or time of day, and they're more affordable, too.

The Wayfarer style comes in basic colors like black and blue, with various colored lenses available.</p><p>If you want a more stylish statement piece, the Ray-Ban Meta Skyler (Gen 2) is the style to opt for. Skyler's frame is shaped like trendy cat eye frames, giving the wearer flair and charm. The colorways for Ray-Ban Meta Skyler (Gen 2) are the most diverse, with the suave Shiny Mystic Violet frame taking the crown as the best-looking variant. This shade comes with a Clear to Amethyst Transitions lens color, adding even more character overall.</p><p>Alternatively, if you want to look like you stepped out of the 70s, the Ray-Ban Meta Headliner (Gen 2) style is hard to beat. This pair has a chunky, thick, very pronounced look with quite a circular curve to the shape of the lenses. Apart from basic black with matte or shiny finishes, Headliner also comes in a warm Shiny Asteroid Grey colorway and lenses with Clear to Emerald Transitions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

From navigation and communication to entertainment and work, our pocket computers offer unmatched convenience and access to information.</p><p>Yet, like any powerful technology, they can come with a potential dark side: smartphone addiction. This isn't merely about enjoying your device; it's about a compulsive and excessive engagement that can negatively impact mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.</p><h2 id="what-is-smartphone-addiction-2">What is Smartphone Addiction?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AiuhELAMNGTtg7ta9GoQgg" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-02" alt="Pixel 10 display home screen weather effect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AiuhELAMNGTtg7ta9GoQgg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problematic_smartphone_use" target="_blank">Smartphone addiction</a>, often referred to as "problematic smartphone use" or "nomophobia" (no-mobile-phone phobia), is characterized by an uncontrollable urge to use your phone, leading to potential consequences in other aspects of life. It’s not <em>officially</em> recognized as a clinical disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), but its symptoms and effects mirror those of other behavioral addictions, and many health care professionals recognize this.</p><p>Reading through material on the web, these are often indicators of smartphone addiction:</p><p><strong>Preoccupation:</strong> Constantly thinking about your phone, even when not using it.<br><strong>Tolerance:</strong> Needing to use your phone for increasingly longer periods to feel satisfied.<br><strong>Withdrawal Symptoms:</strong> Experiencing anxiety, irritability, restlessness, or depression when unable to use your phone.<br><strong>Loss of Control:</strong> Repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control smartphone use.<br><strong>Negative Consequences:</strong> Continued use despite knowing it's causing problems in relationships, work, school, or physical health.<br><strong>Sacrifice of Activities:</strong> Giving up important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of smartphone use.<br><strong>Deception:</strong> Lying to family or friends about the extent of your smartphone use.<br><strong>Mood Alteration:</strong> Using your phone to escape problems or relieve feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety, or depression.</p><p>It's important to distinguish between heavy smartphone use and addiction. Many use their phones extensively for work or social connections <em>without</em> experiencing negative impacts. The critical difference lies in the loss of control and the resulting impairment in daily functioning.</p><p>Like alcohol or gambling, it's so much of a "normal" thing that it can ruin your life. And if you're affected, you probably can't "fix" it alone.</p><h2 id="who-can-be-affected-2">Who Can Be Affected?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="QXr3QgtMPXjA8o9CKme62T" name="Apple-Park-indoors" alt="A crowd of people inside a building at Apple Park" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QXr3QgtMPXjA8o9CKme62T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nabila Popal / IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The reality is that <strong>anyone</strong> who uses a smartphone can potentially develop problematic usage patterns. However, certain factors may increase vulnerability.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6133055/">Adolescents and young adults</a> are still developing and face immense social and peer pressure. Often accompanied by FOMO (fear of missing out) and a need for validation, this can make a smartphone feel more important than it should be.</p><p>Folks with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9902510/">low self-esteem or other existing mental health conditions</a> often use their phone as a way to cope or escape, or even as a distraction from stress. This can deepen the reliance on the phone for comfort.</p><p>People who are otherwise isolated or feel like they are may turn to a phone as a lifeline to the "real world". I can totally understand this, as my physical health issues sometimes keep me indoors and feeling alone for a week or more. It's tough.</p><p>I'm far from being a medical doctor or clinician, but after reading what qualified people have to say, this makes sense to me. We all use our phones as a crutch from time to time and can feel like we depend on them. For some, this feeling of dependency simply doesn't go away. It's crucial to remember that addiction is complex and often multifactorial. While some individuals might seem more prone, responsible and <strong>mindful</strong> use should be a goal for all of us.</p><h2 id="getting-help-before-it-s-too-late-2">Getting help before it's too late</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="LPDThG2WfShtgEJWxooirN" name="digital-wellbeing-downtime.jpg" alt="Digital Wellbeing Downtime" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LPDThG2WfShtgEJWxooirN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phone makers have realized they can help combat any addiction issues by giving us tools to thwart them. I'm familiar with how Android does it, so that's what I'm diving into here, but Apple and Microsoft (tablets and laptops have an addictive screen, too) also have similar tools and utilities in place. These can empower us all to manage our smartphone habits and maybe stop a problem before it is created.</p><p>The central hub for managing your digital habits is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-digital-wellbeing">Digital Wellbeing Dashboard</a>. It provides things like daily usage reports so you can track how much time you really spent staring into the screen, how long you spend on a particular app, or even how many notifications you get. Try it, it's bound to be an eye-opener.</p><p>On the utility side, you can also set app timers to place a daily limit on how long you can do things like scroll Instagram, and once the time is up, the app is done until tomorrow. Focus Mode can even pause the apps that distract you the most, and they stay muted and out of the way until you turn it off.</p><p>The way your screen looks is important, too. When you remove much of the bright color, your phone becomes far less visually stimulating. For some people who crave that stimulation, grayscale mode can be helpful.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nu7EjommBWHbtqLkyovpfn" name="Android-16-M3E-Clear-Notifications-1" alt="Notifications snapping in an out of place as you clear them on Material 3 Expressive." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nu7EjommBWHbtqLkyovpfn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9079661?hl=en#zippy=%2Cturn-notifications-on-or-off-for-certain-apps">so good at notification "management</a>," and it would be a shame not to use it.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> debuted in the U.S. on January 7, 2025, and we expect OnePlus to follow the same timeline this year as well, despite chatter about an early launch.</p><h2 id="qualcomm-unleashed-the-powerful-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-2">Qualcomm unleashed the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zv6rPCPvpWFWZsjoiuLdnH" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-Rocks" alt="The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 on rocks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zv6rPCPvpWFWZsjoiuLdnH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3600" height="2025" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-launch"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>It has been quite an eventful week for Qualcomm, as it launched its next Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, built using Oryon cores. The chip is solely designed for flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, keeping agentic AI and other powerful capabilities in mind.</p><p>The new 3nm chip delivers a significant 20% boost to CPU performance, featuring two prime cores clocked at 4.6GHz and six performance cores optimized for lower-power tasks. This is further enhanced by a faster Adreno GPU, which Qualcomm claims can deliver a 23% performance boost while consuming 20% less power, allowing you to get more out of your gaming experience while worrying less about your battery.</p><p>To put things into perspective, OEMs these days want to pack their devices with as much AI as possible, making sure it doesn't eat up the device's power with all the "thinking" it is doing. A powerful chipset like this one will help take the load off the phone.</p><p>This chip also comes with a 37% faster NPU (Neural Processing Unit); Qualcomm hopes to enable more on-device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">agentic AI</a> features.

This feature allows users to share their phone's camera feed, and they will have the ability to respond to your questions in real time. Since this feature is tied to AI Mode, it will also provide links for intensive research as well. Accessing this feature seems to be a lot more easier as opposed to navigating a ton of steps to help Gemini Live see what you see.</p><p>For instance, you're new to making a cup of matcha — all users have to do is open the Google app (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en_US&pli=1" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_5822647110017996600&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgoogle%2Fid284815942&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fapps-software%2Fandroid-os%2Fgoogle-search-goes-live-with-this-new-feature-that-we-didnt-know-we-needed" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">iOS</a>) and tap the new "Live" icon under the search bar. Then point the camera at the equipment in your matcha set and ask what each tool is used for.

Needless to say, I'd guess that almost all of these 2025 phones will get discounts this year, plus we're likely to see some great deals on smartwatches, tablets, and more. The Galaxy Watch 8, for instance, is sure to receive its first major discount of the year, and I would be surprised if the Galaxy S25 Ultra dropped to under $1,000.</p><p>On the other hand, Prime Day sales don't usually discount last-gen Samsung devices, and you can expect cheap Samsung phones (such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">the popular Galaxy A series</a>) to only receive miniscule price drops.</p><h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-big-deal-days-7">Do I need to be a Prime member to shop during Big Deal Days?</h2><p>As with all Prime Day sale events, the vast majority of deals on display during Big Deal Days will be exclusive to Prime members. If you're not a member just yet, you could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for the 30-day free trial</strong></a> to enjoy all of the benefits of Prime, or you could simply wait and see what deals Amazon's competitors have to offer. Walmart, for example, has already confirmed that its rival sale will kick off on October 7th, and Best Buy is expected to reveal its own competing event soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Three major features in v4.467 for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 start with Adaptive Audio. Now, when you're listening to your music or podcasts, your earbuds will automatically adjust their volume so you remain alert when outside.</p><p>Google states Adaptive Audio will "dynamically reduce the volume of unwanted noises and sounds," while keeping you involved with what's around you.</p><p>Furthering your listening experience is Loud Noise Protection. The changelog states that when a loud noise occurs, such as a fire engine's siren and horn, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will drop its volume, so the siren doesn't burst your eardrums. Rounding out the major features is "Head Gestures" for calls and texts. While wearing your buds, nodding your head will accept calls/begin a reply to a text.</p><p>Shaking your head declines both. Google warns that some apps will require a setup process to get this working, so be alert when this update arrives and you'd like to use it.</p><h2 id="an-update-that-brings-more-2">An update that brings more</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8YusvDBivTmj5P9YAbVZq7" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-2-wintergreen-close-up-1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Wintergreen earbud" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8YusvDBivTmj5P9YAbVZq7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This final feature is more of a QoL (quality of life) update, as Google states Gemini Live interactions should be a little easier in "noisy environments." The patch notes say this update is implementing some "advanced audio processing" that puts more of a focus on your voice over background noises. It's like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-clear-calling-pixel-phones">Clear Calling</a>, but for your conversations with the AI.</p><p>Users should expect their Pixel Buds Pro 2 update to begin appearing today, if not in the next several days.</p><p>The last significant Pixel Buds Pro 2 update rolled out in January, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-pixel-buds-pro-2-finally-get-their-first-update-four-months-later">marked the device's first update</a> four months after its launch. That update was a little lackluster, as its changes/additions weren't explicitly stated after a Reddit user discovered its existence. It also seemed more like a prelude for more to come, as Google was likely more interested in fixing up some problems users encountered early on.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The platform leads its announcement by stating users can "shape the future of AI on YouTube" by engaging. The vice president of YouTube Labs, Aparna Pappu, welcomed users to YouTube Labs, a "dedicated" space for developing AI on the platform.</p><p>YouTube Labs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">is open for a limited number</a> of U.S. testers beginning today (Sep 26).</p><p>If you manage to get invited, the post states the first experiment is about "AI Music Hosts." While this may sound like Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">NotebookLM hosts</a> for studying, YouTube assures these AI hosts are all about entertainment. These AI music hosts will "deepen your listening experience" by talking about relevant music stories, engaging in fan trivia, and even offering some AI commentary.</p><p>Since this first test is all about music, users will primarily engage with the YouTube Music app for the time being. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">Labs explainer</a> states that, while you're listening to music in the app, the AI will "chime in" with these little talkshow-like moments.

Categorized as a "Highlight," users would find AI-generated titles, descriptions, and clips when searching for something they were curious about.

While Fire TV devices have long relied on Amazon’s custom version of Android, evidence is mounting that the company wants more control over its ecosystem, and that means cutting Google’s software out of the picture.</p><p>The clearest sign of this shift came from an earlier job listing, which directly referenced a “Vega OS product” for Fire TV with a 2025 timeline. That mention was quickly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://archive.is/xc0pN" target="_blank">edited out</a>, but not before it raised eyebrows.</p><p>This isn’t the first we’ve heard of Vega OS either. Rumors about the project <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-ditching-android-in-all-of-its-new-devices">date back to 2023</a>, and several Amazon devices like the Echo Hub, Echo Spot, and Echo Show 5 already use lighter versions of it.</p><h2 id="the-reveal-might-be-just-days-away-2">The reveal might be just days away</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="XgSMzZBnPiLf8akaPYczD4" name="amazon-fire-tv-home-screen.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire TV Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgSMzZBnPiLf8akaPYczD4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="843" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What’s new now is timing. The Verge reports that Amazon could reveal Vega OS as early as September 30, during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-tablet/new-devices-and-ai-upgrades-on-the-horizon-at-amazons-annual-fall-event">big fall hardware event in New York</a>.</p><p>If Vega OS does debut this year, it’s likely to show up first on a more affordable Fire TV Stick rather than a high-end television. Importantly, existing Fire TV hardware won’t suddenly lose support — those devices should keep running Fire OS with Android under the hood for the foreseeable future. But for new models, the software story is about to change.</p><p>A key difference with Vega OS is how it handles apps. Fire OS can run Android apps, but Vega will need developers to create apps just for it, using tools like React Native or HTML5. As a result, sideloading APKs might not work the same way or could go away completely.</p><p>Big streaming apps like Netflix and Apple TV are already building for Vega, but it’ll take a while before the lineup feels as complete as today’s Fire TV. Developers now have to split their time between Fire OS and Vega, and some won’t treat the new system as a priority right away.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I'm just as excited as the next nerd about those, but something was said by Google SVP for Platforms and Devices Rick Osterloh during the CEO Keynote that caught my attention.</p><p>Towards the end of the Keynote, Osterloh was asked by Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon "What can you share about this new project we're doing together about personal computing?" Right off the bat, that's enough to get my ears to perk up, as I assumed it would have something to do with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> and ChromeOS. However, Osterloh's response didn't mention ChromeOS or Chromebooks once.</p><h2 id="google-s-entering-the-pc-domain-2">Google's entering the "PC domain"?</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fr2-P5rgkOQ?start=3148" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>"In the past we've always had very different systems between what we're building on PCs and what we're building on smartphones. And we've embarked on a project to combine that. And so, we're building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems."</p><p>That might seem like a bunch of fodder, but it's just the build up before Osterloh reaches the crescendo a moment later. "...bringing all of our application and developer community into the PC domain. So we're really excited about this, and I think this is another way in which Android is going to be able to serve everyone in every computing category."</p><h2 id="pixel-laptop-anyone-2">Pixel Laptop anyone?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="i9s7WdBF5aUym7mW2ggMHB" name="Desktop Mode App Drawer on Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2" alt="Desktop Mode App Drawer on Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i9s7WdBF5aUym7mW2ggMHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but that sure sounded like Google is working on something major, with Osterloh trying to remain as tight-lipped about it as possible. Then, Amon let another cat out of the bag, as he replies with "It's incredible. It delivers on the conversion from mobile to PC. I can't wait to have one." So not only is this a separate platform from say, Windows, but it sure sounded like Google's working on some new hardware.</p><p>Immediately, I was reminded of the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/alleged-google-pixel-laptop-early-report">Pixel Laptop</a>" rumor that was making its rounds in late 2024, which was initially said to be running ChromeOS. However, a subsequent rumor suggested that wouldn't be the case, and instead would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-should-look-to-microsoft-if-the-pixel-laptop-comes-to-fruition">result of merging</a> ChromeOS into Android, creating a completely different, yet familiar, experience.</p><h2 id="google-s-cooking-something-up-2">Google's cooking something up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="u8ymXaiLiDnBozt4qCD2FS" name="google-pixel-c-top-down-view" alt="Top-down view of the Google Pixel C tablet and keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u8ymXaiLiDnBozt4qCD2FS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That would've been enough for me to be intrigued, but then, our friends over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/google-is-testing-android-desktop-on-chromebooks-and-im-not-sure-what-to-think/" target="_blank">Chrome Unboxed</a> called out a discovery made by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromebooklive.com/google-semble-tester-android-desktop-sur-chromebook/" target="_blank">Chromebook Live</a> about "Android Desktop." And before that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/a-new-chromebook-tablet-sapphire-just-appeared-with-a-decidedly-made-by-google-feature/" target="_blank">Chrome Unboxed</a> found references to a brand new ARM-powered ChromeOS tablet codenamed "Sapphire" with "code changes that explicitly add support for an LED light bar." Where have I seen the light bar before? Oh right, on the Chromebook Pixel and Pixel C, two devices made by Google.</p><p>All of this comes on the back of Google's continued push to merge the ChromeOS and Android kernels, representing a tectonic shift for both platforms. Not to mention all of the progress we've seen with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16s-desktop-mode-was-right-in-front-of-us-the-entire-time">Desktop Mode on Android 16</a>, letting you plug your phone into a monitor and being presented with an interface similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a> has offered for years.</p><p>Based on the conversation between Osterloh and Amon, I don't think they were talking about a device that requires a phone for it to run (i.e. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/nexdock-wireless-review">NexDock</a>). It just feels like Google is gearing up for a massive release and something that could change the way we think about Android and ChromeOS forever.</p><h2 id="sorry-tensor-the-snapdragon-is-here-2">Sorry Tensor, the Snapdragon is here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="bCL9oatgKwaZwPUjHcvPLZ" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-x2-elite-plaque-wc" alt="Picture of a plaque for the Snapdragon X2 Elite announcement" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCL9oatgKwaZwPUjHcvPLZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1165" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's another interesting tidbit to throw into the mix here, and it's not something that I was expecting. In the past, I've suggested that Google should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-tensor-pixelbook">make a splash</a> by releasing a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">Pixelbook powered</a> by its own Tensor SoC.</p><p>It sure seems as though that won't be the case, and instead could be powered by a Qualcomm chip. And seeing as the hardware is at the point that its being demoed, albeit privately, this suggests Google is closer than we thought to actually releasing a new piece of hardware to pair with its new OS venture.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4KQk4srKzbT6jtGPCsCcxn" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-21" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KQk4srKzbT6jtGPCsCcxn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If I were to guess, this would be powered by one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/qualcomm/snapdragon-x2-elite-extreme-announcement-2025">Snapdragon X2 Elite processors</a>, as opposed to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>. This would give Qualcomm a way to respond to MediaTek's inclusion of the Kompanio Ultra found in the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on">Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14</a> and more recently, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514.</p><p>No matter what happens, it's clear that something big is on the way and that it's just a matter of "when" and not "if." That alone should be enough to get everyone excited about the future of ChromeOS and Android.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With the launch of their latest lineup, including the updated Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the new Oakley Meta Vanguard, and the groundbreaking Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta isn't just releasing new hardware—they're cementing their lead in a market that's just starting to heat up.</p><h2 id="meta-s-hardware-advantage-and-genius-strategy-2">Meta's hardware advantage and genius strategy</h2><p>For anyone betting on the "wait and see" approach from Android XR or others, it's time to get real. The future of AR is here, and it's wearing Ray-Bans. But the implications aren't just for Meta's competitors; there are potential long-term risks for consumers too.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-launch">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard </a>are natural extensions of Meta's long-standing partnership with the eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica. While they may not have a display, they're critical to Meta's strategy. These aren't just minor upgrades; the inclusion of an improved camera is a welcome one, as photo and video capture remains the primary use case for these glasses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="b6MLc94WARGxTnu3rcf4t8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-display-Meta-Store-2" alt="A display of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b6MLc94WARGxTnu3rcf4t8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But the real genius here isn't just the hardware. It's the strategy. The partnership with a luxury eyeglass maker provides these smart glasses with an extensive distribution network, including physical stores and e-commerce sites, that the competition simply does not have. Plus, with the addition of Oakley, Meta is tapping into the athletic and performance-driven crowd, broadening the appeal of its hardware beyond the tech-savvy crowd.</p><p>It doesn't just end with distribution or new designs. Meta's glasses have a huge installed base with over 3.5 million units of their previous Ray-Ban Meta glasses already shipped as of the second half of 2025, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/"><u>IDC</u></a> estimates.</p><p>Think about that for a second. While Google and its partners are still in the R&D phase, figuring out how to get a display into their glasses, Meta has millions of users already capturing photos and videos, sharing their lives, and getting comfortable with the idea of tech-enabled eyewear. This isn't a small detail—it puts Android XR firmly on the back foot. They're not just competing on features; they're competing on adoption.</p><h2 id="the-price-war-and-competitive-threat-2">The price war and competitive threat</h2><p>And now, for the main event: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a>. These are the first smart glasses from Meta to include a display, and on a technical level, they offer a unique AR experience that has been out of reach for consumers until now. The $799 price point is a bold choice. It strongly suggests that Meta is willing to heavily subsidize its hardware or at least offer it at a minimal markup.</p><p>The price is high enough to limit appeal to early adopters, but it sets unrealistic expectations for consumers who expect future iterations and competing versions to be offered at a similar or lower price. While this is great news for consumers in the short term, it's a huge problem for the competition. Meta's willingness to subsidize its hardware—something they've done with their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v72-bad-christmas-update">Quest headsets</a> to great success—puts Google and its partners at a severe disadvantage.</p><p>Historically, Google hasn't been willing to play this game of hardware subsidies to the same extent, which means its partners will have a hard time competing on price. This strategy crowds out competing vendors and allows Meta to solidify its market position without worrying about rivals. For consumers, this is a double-edged sword. While it means access to advanced tech at a lower price now, a lack of competition in the long run could stifle innovation and lead to higher prices, along with a more restricted ecosystem down the road.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SBdxzHfsew8Zg2eEXCd4tX" name="Meta-Connect-Meta-RayBan-Display-IDCxAC" alt="Meta's smart glasses are great and everyone should be worried" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:94,l:240,cw:1440,ch:810,q:80/SBdxzHfsew8Zg2eEXCd4tX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jitesh Ubrani/ IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="android-xr-s-technical-and-timeline-disadvantage-2">Android XR's technical and timeline disadvantage</h2><p>Adding insult to injury, based on what I've heard from some folks in the industry, similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR glasses</a> with displays likely won't hit shelves until late 2026, and even that may be an ambitious timeline, so it likely won't happen until 2027. By the time they finally hit the market, Meta will have had close to a two-year head start.</p><p>Furthermore, the Android XR demos we've seen so far lag Meta in some critical areas. One issue is the lack of a discrete input method. While Meta's neural band introduces a novel and subtle interface, allowing users to navigate on-screen menus through subtle, intentional gestures, Android XR seems to be a step behind.</p><p>Another technical detail that highlights Meta's advantage is their choice of display technology. While<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage"> Android XR demos</a> have been seen using refractive waveguides, which often increase "eye glow" on the wearer's face—potentially creating social friction—Meta's use of geometric waveguides is a game-changer.</p><p>This technical choice results in a much more natural appearance and puts significant pressure on Android XR to find a solution that doesn't make users feel like they're walking around with a glowing screen on their face.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn" name="android-xr-xreal-glasses-reflection" alt="The Android XR logo reflected in the left lens of a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="meta-s-tricky-limited-rollout-and-consumer-risk-2">Meta's tricky limited rollout and consumer risk</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NCq6GMV3knFYSJtWe3BUwi" name="meta-connect-2025-show-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-typing-writing" alt="A screen capture of Mark Zuckerberg showing off typing on Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses at Meta Connect 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NCq6GMV3knFYSJtWe3BUwi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Initially launching the Display glasses exclusively in the U.S. and with a limited, curated rollout in select physical retail locations, Meta is taking a cautious, hands-on approach. These stores will offer a tailored experience to ensure proper fit, screen alignment, and onboarding for new users. This isn't just about selling a product; it's about educating the market.</p><p>By focusing on familiar experiences such as messaging and social media—thanks to the deep integration with services like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Meta AI—the company is easing consumers into this new computing paradigm.</p><p>Viewing the product from this lens, the Meta Ray-Ban Display isn't just a consumer product; it's a public prototype. It's designed to gather feedback and evolve, serving as a precursor to Meta's more advanced Orion glasses that were displayed at the company's 2024 developer conference, which offered a full AR experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BwgL9vEuHhnL2VFNGWaKA3" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-with-gesture-band-07" alt="An official lifestyle shot of someone wearing Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BwgL9vEuHhnL2VFNGWaKA3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By the time Android XR finally enters the market in a meaningful way, Meta will have had years of real-world data, millions of users, and a deeply entrenched ecosystem. The Meta Ray-Ban Display allows the company to widen and deepen its moat in the smart glasses market, and with every new release, that moat gets harder for the competition to cross.</p><p>The message is clear: the future of smart glasses is here, and Meta is ready to own it. The question is, can Android XR catch up? More importantly, what happens to consumers when one company has a near monopoly on technology that is so personal and integrated into our daily lives?</p> ]]></dc:content>

These animations typically explain the various functions and features users can expect from their phone or, in this case, TriFold phone. The tipster's first selection regards the device's alleged prowess for multitasking. One look gives us a glimpse at its toggleable "continue apps on main screen" button in Settings.</p><p>After doing so, users can open an app when the device is folded (on its cover display) and open their phone and see the app continue in landscape, rather than portrait.</p><p>On the other hand, we have some leaked animations showcasing the device's splitscreen/dual-app capabilities. The post suggests the TriFold will let users place two apps atop one another on half the screen. Users can drag and drop the apps from the top of their respective windows to reposition them. Other quick actions display a tab at the top of the Galaxy TriFold in landscape mode, which, when tapped, opens your app drawer.</p><p>This functionality is also spotted by a two-finger press-and-hold gesture from the left side of the internal display.</p><p>Another video purports that users can have their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TechHighest/status/1971600746690015483">apps as floating windows</a> on the Galaxy TriFold. It really makes the device feel like you're holding a mini-laptop or maybe even a tablet in your hands. Users can expand these floating windows or go full-screen with them, and shift them around as they please.</p><h2 id="something-unexpected-a-strong-camera-2">Something unexpected: a strong camera?</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello again multifold 👋We've got a bunch videos for you... 1/5🧵With the help of @evowizz pic.twitter.com/GUhI8HPx5g<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1971600608051568883">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Samsung DeX was briefly mentioned in this extensive leak by the tipster, who showed off an animation of its PC connection. In the example, the larger display (the PC) embodies the look of the Galaxy TriFold with its background and navigational bar with apps. It shows a cursor, indicating that users can slide onto their TriFold, grab and drag an app over to their computer. It's essentially what you'd expect from Samsung DeX.</p><p>In landscape mode, the phone's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TechHighest/status/1971600716411371840">camera app was highlighted</a>. While this isn't entirely new, given we have the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the tipster notes one key addition: the existence of a 100x zoom button. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TechHighest/status/1971600608051568883">other lingering animations</a> brought awareness to Samsung's Galaxy AI, which is coming in clutch (per usual) for users looking for webpage summaries and more. However, the two tipsters found that users could detach this Galaxy AI sidebar that appears and have it as a floating window.</p><p>Moreover, users taking a call (or placing one) will see a floating phone UI for the call. The UI mirrors what you'd find if you were calling on your cover display or even a regular phone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-unusual-move-2">Samsung's unusual move</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4527" height="2546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rumors earlier this month claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifold-may-debut-in-the-us-amid-rumors-of-a-simultaneous-launch-event">could break tradition</a> and launch its expected Galaxy Z TriFold this fall.

Assuming it's not just a generic image, it suggests COROS will use a different button layout from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-review">APEX 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">APEX 2 Pro</a>, with a top-right crown and a bottom-left button instead of three right buttons with a centered crown.</p><p>The recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-nomad-3-has-impressed-me-as-fun-garmin-instinct-3-rival">COROS NOMAD</a> has a similar button layout, with the bottom-left Action button used for shortcuts like Voice Pins or Maps; we'd guess the hypothetical APEX 3 will have its own custom shortcuts.</p><p>The teaser image also shows COROS's familiar three-prong charging port and a silicone strap, even though the APEX 2 series defaulted to a nylon strap.</p><p>COROS won't share any more information until October 15 at 9 a.m. EDT. But based on the old APEX specs and the last three years of COROS releases, we can speculate on what the brand has in store for this device.</p><h2 id="what-we-expect-from-the-coros-apex-3-series-2">What we expect from the COROS APEX 3 series</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7UMbkY5ciTJHp3KnU2ZidP" name="COROS-APEX-2-and-2-Pro-2.jpeg" alt="COROS APEX 2 and APEX 2 Pro side-by side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7UMbkY5ciTJHp3KnU2ZidP.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The APEX 2 and APEX 2 Pro </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the nearly three years since the APEX 2 series launched, COROS has sold two new PACE running watches — including its first AMOLED <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">PACE Pro</a> — a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-announced-with-46-day-battery">VERTIX 2S</a> watch, and a brand-new NOMAD adventurers watch that encroaches a bit on the APEX series' territory.</p><p>As a given, we can expect the APEX 3 (Pro) to offer a titanium bezel, sapphire glass, dual-band GPS, offline maps with street names and POIs powered by COROS's fast new Ambiq Apollo 510 processor, an altimeter and gyroscope, and at least two weeks of battery life. We'd also expect a price in the $350–500 range.</p><p>One of the big questions will be whether COROS follows industry trends and switches the APEX series to AMOLED. If it keeps MIP, the new APEX would match the NOMAD's display with better visibility and contrast. But rival mid-range watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Garmin Forerunner 570</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-2-hands-on-accuracy-test">Suunto Race 2</a> use bright AMOLED displays with better resolution, while still offering good longevity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="TwCYCvaMfcmYtgcJdt2zEQ" name="COROS-NOMAD-workout-elevation-summary" alt="The COROS NOMAD watch showing a post-hike workout summary with elevation data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TwCYCvaMfcmYtgcJdt2zEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another question is whether COROS will find a way to close the gap on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> when it comes to mainstream smarts like a mic & speaker for Bluetooth calling, contactless payments, music streaming apps, or a flashlight. But these all feel like longshots.</p><p>The biggest question, in my mind, will be how COROS differentiates the APEX series from the NOMAD and VERTIX series.</p><p>The NOMAD caters to hikers and fishermen, letting you save voice recordings or photos of trails or fish to an Adventure Journal" of each activity for you to look at or share later. And the VERTIX very specifically targets serious climbers. So, what "mountain sports" will the APEX 3 or APEX 3 Pro focus on?</p><p>Whatever COROS has in store with its all-new APEX watch, we're intrigued. While they're a bit outdated at this point, the APEX 2s were among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watches</a> of their time, and they have a more premium look for those who don't like the plastic-heavy PACE and NOMAD designs.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Researchers at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/cve-2025-10184-oneplus-oxygenos-telephony-provider-permission-bypass-not-fixed/" target="_blank">Rapid7</a> found a flaw, identified as CVE-2025-10184, that lets harmful apps read and send your text messages without your permission.</p><p>In practice, this means an attacker could intercept sensitive texts like two-factor authentication (2FA) codes or even send out messages on your behalf, opening the door to account takeovers and fraud.</p><p>Rapid7 explains that the issue started when OnePlus changed Android’s built-in telephony content provider (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/unpatched-flaw-in-oneplus-phones-lets-rogue-apps-text-messages/" target="_blank">BleepingComputer</a>). The company added new components called PushMessageProvider, PushShopProvider, and ServiceNumberProvider, but did not set proper limits on write permissions. Because of this, harmful apps can take advantage of the system using SQL injections or similar tricks, getting around Android’s usual protections.</p><h2 id="which-phones-are-hit-2">Which phones are hit</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="98AmdZe62ittUALL9zio8J" name="OnePlus-10T-vs-10-Pro-back-01.jpg" alt="The OnePlus 10 Pro (green) next to the OnePlus 10T (black)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/98AmdZe62ittUALL9zio8J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The vulnerability has been confirmed on devices such as the OnePlus 8T with OxygenOS 12 and the OnePlus 10 Pro running OxygenOS 14 and 15, though Rapid7 warns that other models are likely impacted too.</p><p>OxygenOS 11 does not seem to have this problem, which means the flaw likely appeared in later versions. Since the issue affects how SMS messages are handled, it puts <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">most recent OnePlus phones</a> at risk and is more serious than most bugs.</p><p>The situation became more concerning because OnePlus was slow to respond. Rapid7 reported the flaw in May 2025 and followed up several times, but the company did not reply for months. OnePlus only recognized the problem after Rapid7 made its findings public and shared a proof of concept.</p><h2 id="fix-incoming-2">Fix incoming</h2><p>The company has since confirmed that it has developed a fix and promised that a security patch will begin rolling out globally in mid-October, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/25/oneplus-devices-have-a-big-sms-vulnerability-but-a-patch-is-finally-on-the-way/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. According to OnePlus, the patch will address the permission bypass and close off the SMS loophole.</p><p>Until the update arrives, OnePlus users should be careful about which apps they install. Only download apps from trusted sources, since harmful apps are the main way this flaw can be used. It’s also a good idea to remove any apps you don’t use or that seem suspicious.</p><p>Experts also suggest using safer options for two-factor authentication, such as authenticator apps or hardware security keys, instead of relying on SMS codes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's very affordable in Asia, and you're guaranteed to get a neat, bubble-free application.</p><p>Over the years, I have started to try to apply screen protectors myself because I go through a lot of phones. And I never use any phone without a screen protector, even if it's only a temporary review or test that'll last a month or two. After all, you never know when an accident will happen.</p><p>Spigen is one of the few name brands that offer reasonably priced screen protector kits. Naturally, as soon as I got my Pixel 10 Pro, I got my hands on the full set for my phone. The kit is the most comprehensive one I have seen. It includes a squigee, dusters, a microfiber cloth, an alignment tray, sticky dust removers, and even a placement mat to hold your phone in place.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2643px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="JRDhDQ3BAjRrP7kBAAnN2o" name="google-pixel-10-pro-spigen-screen-protector-lifestyle-1" alt="Installing the Spigen GLAStR EZ Fit screen protector for the Google Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JRDhDQ3BAjRrP7kBAAnN2o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2643" height="1487" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qdeqnKmDn3gdm3iKUaDp9o" name="google-pixel-10-pro-spigen-screen-protector-lifestyle-3" alt="Installing the Spigen GLAStR EZ Fit screen protector for the Google Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qdeqnKmDn3gdm3iKUaDp9o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Since there are two screen protectors included in the kit. Each piece of glass comes with its own installation tray. There are also multiple cleaning tools to cover the second application as well.</p><p>The installation process is so simple, even a child could do it. All you have to do is place the Pixel 10 on the mat, clean it up with all the tools provided, and then put the alignment frame on top. It's built to go on top of the phone in a manner that perfectly aligns the screen guard every single time.</p><p>After that, all you have to do is press in the direction that the sticker says so, wait a few seconds, and then pull the tab. That's it! If there are any bubbles, simply use the squeegee to push them out. It's stupidly easy to achieve a beautiful installation with the Spigen GlasTR EZ FIT screen protector kit on your Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3619px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="EKTyRUoaNkndagagzSUBvn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-spigen-screen-protector-lifestyle-4" alt="Installing the Spigen GLAStR EZ Fit screen protector for the Google Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EKTyRUoaNkndagagzSUBvn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3619" height="2036" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I was over the moon to see that the Spigen Optik EZ Fit camera lens protector kit is almost as thorough. The only thing it's missing is the placement mat. But if you get the screen protector as well, like I did, you can simply reuse that mat for the camera lens protector installation.</p><p>There are two sets of everything in the box: a cleaning kit, a squeegee, and two lens protectors with two frames. Just like the screen protector, you tidy up the Pixel 10's camera bar using the provided tools until it's sparkling clean before applying the frame. After that, simply press the lens into place and pull the tab. Voila! Perfection achieved within minutes.</p><p>For just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-AluminaCore-Aluminum-Enhanced-Durability-Resistance/dp/B0D851Z6N8/"><strong>$19.99 for the Pixel 10 screen protector</strong></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Protector-Glas-tR-Designed-Friendly/dp/B0FBDQ73HY/"><strong>$15.99 for the camera bar protector</strong></a>, Spigen delivers phenomenal value. The glass imitates the feel and touch response of the Pixel 10's own display, so you don't even feel like you have a screen guard on. It's definitely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-screen-protectors">best Pixel 10 screen protector kit</a> to get.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Chinese OEM announced its newest series today <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/global/discover/article?id=5471">via a press release</a>, highlighting the new goods consumers will find domestically. Kicking off the series is the company's base Xiaomi 17, which mirrors the design consumers got with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a>. The newer phone sports a 6.3-inch compact design with rounded corners, flat sides, and a flat display.</p><p>With LIPO technology, Xiaomi states the base 17 can reach 3,500nits of peak brightness. The camera array—its look and design—almost makes one say it resembles Apple's iPhone a little. Either way, the Xiaomi 17's camera array features a 50MP primary lens with f/1.67 aperture (good for low-light situations).</p><p>Giving this device a major power boost is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-launch">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>.</p><p>Its telephoto is reportedly bringing in a Leica 60mm "floating lens" design at f/2.0 aperture and 10cm close-up zoom.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1669px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.02%;"><img id="LthmhoVLw7tTYfoeG3HDyd" name="xiaomi-17-base-model" alt="The Xiaomi 17 features a squared camera array, flat sides, and a flat display that comes in at 6.3-inches." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LthmhoVLw7tTYfoeG3HDyd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1669" height="935" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wrapping things up is a 7,000mAh battery for this compact phone. Xiaomi states this battery should excel with an extended battery lifespan and "excellent low-temperature endurance." Additionally, over the last series, the Xiaomi 17 features 100W wired charging, 50W wireless charging, and "compatibility with the 100W PPS universal charging protocol."</p><p>The base model features the following RAM/storage configs: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, and 16/512GB. The Xiaomi 17 starts at 4,499 Yuan (~$630).</p><p>There are three total devices in this new series, and that's where Xiaomi goes next: the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. The company is touting these two devices as the pinnacle of its recent innovations this year. Just like the base model, the Xiaomi 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. The Xiaomi 17 Pro features a 6.3-inch display. This display, just like the base model, utilizes an M10 Display Panel and SuperRED luminous material for efficiency and enhanced brightness.</p><p>However, the major advancement for it is the "Dynamic Back Display."</p><h2 id="the-xiaomi-17-pro-2">The Xiaomi 17 Pro</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1670px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.05%;"><img id="iiKUetRx3cwYKGFJrKr8NZ" name="xiaomi-17-pro-series-four-colors" alt="The Xiaomi 17 Pro series features a Dynamic Back Display capable of showing AI wallpapers, dynamic notifications, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iiKUetRx3cwYKGFJrKr8NZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1670" height="936" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Incorporated with the phone's dual camera array on its rear panel is the 2.6-inch Dynamic Back Display. This display, which Xiaomi says will blend a dual-screen design for its smartphone, "enhances lifestyle and efficiency under various scenarios." This secondary display provides users with a customizable watch face, AI-generated wallpapers, "virtual pets," dynamic notifications, notes, and more.</p><p>Regarding those AI wallpapers, Xiaomi states users can lean on their photos for this feature. Real-time notifications on the Dynamic Back Display include flight alerts, train ticket alerts, delivery info for food orders, and more. More importantly, just like a foldable, this secondary screen can help users take photos, whether it's of other people or themselves.</p><p>Xiaomi draws attention to a special gaming case for the 17 Pro and Pro Max, which turns the models into a retro gaming console when the main display is off.</p><p>The Xiaomi 17 Pro features two 50MP lenses within this back display, with the main camera receiving f/1.67 aperture capabilities. Specifically for the 17 Pro, the post states consumers will find an inverted floating lens telephoto that supports up to 20cm macro shots.

Like the 17 Pro, the 17 Pro Max's back display is 2.6 inches and supports AI wallpapers, customizable watch faces, dynamic notifications, and more.</p><p>While the Pro Max's 50MP primary lens mirrors the others, Xiaomi states it offers a powerful 5x periscope lens with hardware-level HDR support.

The Venu 3 looks great indoors and is perfectly readable outdoors, but the Venu 4 matches the brightness standard of most other smartwatches these days.</p><p>Another subtle change is that the Venu 4 display border no longer has clock markings along the edge at five-second intervals. Sportier Garmins tend to add words and numbers in the margins, making the Venu 4 much more subtle and defined by the watch face.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Venu 4 didn't upgrade the Venu 3's Gorilla Glass 3 protection. Garmin reserves sapphire glass for premium models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>, not acknowledging that "mid-range" models like the Venu 4 and Forerunner 570 cost hundreds more than other watches with higher-end scratch protection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bAHXaYEvtLaqavhWBYfqdh" name="Garmin-Venu-3-side-buttons.jpeg" alt="Side view of the Garmin Venu 3's metal buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bAHXaYEvtLaqavhWBYfqdh.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu series skips Garmin's typical five-button layout, relying on two buttons and touch controls. But the Venu 3 added a unique third button for shortcuts — which I found quite convenient — before the Venu 4 (and Venu X1) removed it. I'd guess that not enough people used it, and casuals got it confused with the Back button too often. Plus, it detracted from the Venu series' minimalist look.</p><p>With the Venu 4, the main Start button is smaller and rounder, but still steel-coated, while the Back button keeps the rectangular look.</p><p>Both watches have a stainless steel bezel, but the Venu 4 bezel is smooth where the Venu 3's was ridged. I'd say these design differences are a matter of preference, rather than one being "better" than the other; either bezel is more attractive than the rounded aluminum bezel on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="J47MVuPqQ4scFjcm5g92PS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-weighted-ball-workout-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a man's wrist as he works out with an exercise ball." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J47MVuPqQ4scFjcm5g92PS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most notable design change is that the Venu 4 uses a blend of fiber-reinforced polymer and stainless steel in the case, giving it a more refined look than the Venu 3 but keeping it lighter than the steel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>.</p><p>Garmin managed to keep the Venu 4 relatively skinny — the 41mm model is still 12mm thick, while the 45mm model is 0.5mm thicker — but both sizes are 9g and 6g heavier than their predecessors, respectively. It's not a massive difference, but where the Venu 3 was lighter than most Garmins, the Venu 4's weight is more typical for the brand.</p><p>Lastly, the Venu 4 colors are pretty much unchanged — Slate, Silver, and a gold option for the smaller model — and Garmin once again gave the Venu 4 silicone bands with smaller (less breathable) holes than on the sporty Forerunner bands. But if you buy it from Garmin, you can customize the Venu 4 with a fabric or leather band instead.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-3-hardware-sensors-battery-life-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. 3: Hardware, sensors, & battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gbSyFeJY9aXLDo9nRdSUHK" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-voice-assistant" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on a table outside, the display showing the text "Try Saying 'What can I say?'" for the Voice Assistant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbSyFeJY9aXLDo9nRdSUHK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Venu 4's new voice assistant on the Forerunner 970 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin doesn't advertise its processors, but the Venu 4 should run on slightly newer hardware, matching other 2024 and 2025 watches with the newer Garmin OS. This should mitigate the loss of the third shortcut button, because apps and functions are much easier to find with the new UI.</p><p>Both the Venu 4 and Venu 3 have a mic and speaker for Bluetooth calls and passthrough commands to your phone's Gemini or Siri assistant. But the newer OS enables on-watch voice commands like starting a workout or pulling up your sleep score. I find these commands to be finicky and limited, unfortunately.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en" name="Garmin-Venu-3-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG summary page on the Garmin Venu 3 saying the author's sinus rhythm is normal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You won't find any changes to the health sensors.

Two years later, even ultra-expensive models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-announced-with-lte-satellite-and-microled-key-highlights">Fenix 8 Pro</a> still use this sensor suite.</p><p>Garmin has patented <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-has-patented-long-term-blood-glucose-tracking-heres-how-itd-work">long-term glycated hemoglobin tracking</a>, hemocrit tracking, and other new metrics that we'd have loved to see the Venu 4 introduce. Instead, the only new Venu 4 health features are software-based, which we'll discuss in the next section.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-flashlight-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 at night with the flashlight on and pointing at the camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like most 2025 Garmins, the Venu 4 adds a built-in LED flashlight with four white brightness settings and one dim red setting, all accessible by long-pressing the Back button. You can set it to blink or strobe during nighttime activities to avoid collisions or hold your arm steady to illuminate a small portion of the road ahead of you.</p><p>What's slightly more surprising is that the Venu 4 now has dual-band GPS tracking! The Venu 3 — and even the $800 Venu X1 — use all-systems GNSS, which delivers dependably accurate data in normal circumstances but isn't quite as <em>pinpoint</em> accurate in tougher conditions. It makes the Venu 4 more appealing to the Forerunner and Fenix crowd.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4rdbZRsBBrhq35Cyzuhaoi" name="Garmin-Venu-3-body-battery.jpeg" alt="A Body Battery chart on the Garmin Venu 3, showing stress levels in the background contributing to higher battery drain." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rdbZRsBBrhq35Cyzuhaoi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another noticeable trend with recent Garmin watches is that their doubled brightness corresponds to lower battery life. The Venu 4 45mm only lasts 12 days (four with AOD), while the Venu 3 45mm lasts 14 days (five with AOD). It's a slight compromise, but an easier one to accept than the Venu X1 (eight days or two with AOD).</p><p>If you're looking at a smaller model, both the Venu 4 and 3 41mm hit 10 days per charge, but the older model lasts an extra two days in AOD mode.

And it pulls features like the smart wake alarm and daily suggested walks from the Vivoactive 6.</p><p>Aside from these imported tools, the Venu 4 introduces a few exclusive perks — at least until Garmin ports them to other models.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yuqPkgh3idTL5Mi4Soy2dS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-weighted-ropes-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a woman's wrist as she trains with weighted battle ropes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yuqPkgh3idTL5Mi4Soy2dS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8149" height="4584" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin has traditionally siloed its coaching and suggested workouts into individual categories like running, cycling, and strength. The Venu 4, however, is getting a new generalized "Fitness Coach" that "provides personalized workouts for over 25 different fitness activities – from walking and indoor cycling to rowing, HIIT, and more."</p><p>This feels tailored to the Venu series, which has traditionally focused more on indoor gym or home workouts with animations and muscle maps. And the same goes for the new "mixed session activity" profile, which will let you track different gym workouts in one general activity instead of splitting them up or using one "Cardio" activity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="pwBuxQnrGUCNtYxsMepxRK" name="garmin-venu-4-health-status-screenshot" alt="A render of the Garmin Venu 4 showing the user's "Last Sleep" data with Heart Rate and HRV stats against their baseline, with a phone next to the watch showing more in-depth Health Status data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pwBuxQnrGUCNtYxsMepxRK.png" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Health Status shows how your body's nightly heart rate, blood oxygen, HRV, skin temperature, and respiration rate compare against your baseline. It then warns you via the Morning Report if you have any "outliers" as a sign of illness or poor lifestyle choices.</p><p>On that note, Lifestyle logging has you tell Garmin the positive, negative, or neutral actions you've taken throughout the day so that it can provide insights into their physiological impact on metrics like stress and sleep quality. You can log eating or drinking coffee late, having a period or migraine, wearing a CPAP, getting a massage or acupuncture, or <em>many</em> other options.</p><p>The Venu 3 will receive both of these features, but only in the Connect <em>app</em>; if you want a Health Status watch widget or easy on-wrist logging, you'll need the Venu 4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c2kQfCzQT8XnTLws6Rf9wS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-accessibility" alt="A photo of a disabled basketball player in a wheelchair, bouncing the ball while wearing the Garmin Venu 4 in the other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c2kQfCzQT8XnTLws6Rf9wS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu 3 first introduced a wheelchair mode and tracked pushes instead of steps. The Venu 4 will build on this with accessibility features for the colorblind (color filters like grayscale or red/green) and the visually impaired (a spoken watch face and hourly vocal alerts with health data).</p><p>More broadly, Garmin will build on the Venu 3's sleep coach and enhanced body battery data with the Venu 4, judging your circadian rhythm to determine "how aligned the body is to its inner sleep cycle." It'll also track your "sleep consistency" after seven days of tracking.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-3-which-should-you-buy-or-should-you-upgrade-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu 3: Which should you buy, or should you upgrade?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2WXustBPFucpSfKJWfVtKS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-yoga" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a woman's wrist as she does a yoga pose on a mat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2WXustBPFucpSfKJWfVtKS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin watches are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/are-garmin-watches-like-fenix-8-pro-getting-too-expensive">getting more expensive</a>, so the $550 Venu 4 doesn't surprise me. But it's still expensive for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>; the Venu 3 felt more accessible, in the same range as other "normal" smartwatches. You can argue that dual-band GPS, flashlight, training load, and other perks are worth $100 extra, but it's not clear if Venu fans will care about these perks as much as Fenix or Forerunner users.</p><p>Ultimately, I think your upgrade decision will come down to the new health and training tools, more than the hardware. Do you want a new personalized training plan, or running/ cycling workouts as cross-training for your gym workouts? Or do you want more insights on how to live a healthier lifestyle with better sleep? If this sounds intriguing, the Venu 4 will be a good fit.</p><p>If that all sounds superfluous, I'd say you can stick with the Venu 3 and hold out until 2027 for a Venu 5 with newer health sensors.

These glasses last nearly twice as long on a single charge versus the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>.

The battery life of each pair is also nearly double that is Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1), delivering 60% more photos and video capture per charge, plus longer audio playback and livestreaming.

I took these styles out for testing and found that Oakley Meta HSTN don't stay on as well as the Ray-Bans if you tilt your head a lot. In this case, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/sBL0acIBb2Y?si=IezdCieQBb_xM-sm&t=137">I used burpees as a test</a>, but skateboarding or other intense sports like that could easily see your glasses flying off if you don't have a chance to push them back up.</p><p>That's at least a little ironic since the Oakley's are geared more toward athletes than Ray-Ban Metas. On the flip side, Oakley Meta HSTN PRIZM lenses are a unique take on tinted lenses that work exceptionally well in the sun, blocking out a significant portion of light and adding a vibrant hue to your world. You can only get them on Oakley glasses, so while they're a pricier upgrade, they're worth it for folks who spend a lot of time outside.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmKeGuJSGAC3PuSEwE9Mpm" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-prizm-lens-color-comparison" alt="Comparing Oakley Meta HSTN Prizm lenses with Ray-Ban Meta transition lenses to see the color difference" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmKeGuJSGAC3PuSEwE9Mpm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aZhCor9KExLYe7L9pYExbm" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-prizm-lens-tint-comparison" alt="Comparing Oakley Meta HSTN Prizm lenses with Ray-Ban Meta transition lenses for tinting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZhCor9KExLYe7L9pYExbm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) also wins on sheer number of style options. Oakley Meta HSTN has just one frame style with four different color options. From there, you can also choose from six different lens colors and types: clear, Transitions grey, Transitions amethyst, PRIZM Ruby, PRIZM deep water polarized, and PRIZM black polarized.</p><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) are offered in three main styles: Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler. Wayfarers are available in six different colors, Skylers are available in seven different colors, and Headliners are available six different colors. Each style also includes the option of choosing different lens types and colors, from transitions, polarized lenses, prescription lenses, or plain clear lenses.</p><p>That gives the Ray-Bans the clear edge but, as with anything fashion-related, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. As a bonus, the cheapest pair of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses is $20 cheaper than Oakley Meta HSTN, which is great if you just want a snazzy color and standard, clear lenses.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-vs-oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-a-great-pair-of-smart-glasses-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta HSTN glasses: A great pair of smart glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Fab4taxMjQQ2osmqxSfRxD" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-glasses-selfie-Black" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses with Black lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fab4taxMjQQ2osmqxSfRxD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regardless if you pick Oakley Meta HSTN or Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), you're getting a great pair of smart glasses that'll last you most of the day and come packed with exciting Meta AI features.</p><p>What's more is that the new video recording features packed inside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vangaurd</a> smart glasses are also coming to both Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) and Oakley Meta HSTN.</p><p>That includes slow-motion video recording, as well as hyperlapse recording.

At one of Qualcomm's designated zones, the publication reports that Samsung's XR headset, currently known as "Project Moohan," was inside a glass case with its branding showcased prominently.</p><p>Summit visitors were able to get a clear look at the device in its entirety, though Samsung was reportedly not sharing any details—Qualcomm neither. The device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsungs-xr-headset-could-finally-launch-in-september">looks pretty similar</a> to what we've seen shown off from Google's side and Samsung's side this year.</p><p>The large front houses the display technologies (supposedly OLEDoS tech) and everything else Samsung needs for the XR headset to function. Now, The Elec cites Qualcomm, which spoke briefly about its chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Elite (from 2024), stating it supports "smooth photo editing and video speed control with on-device AI." The publication speculates that Samsung's headset could sport some of these capabilities once users get their hands on it.</p><p>It's also been reiterated that Project Moohan will receive a healthy dose of Google's Gemini.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-first-xr-headset-is-inbound-2">Samsung's first XR headset is inbound</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:866px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.28%;"><img id="HPngbyiongeXT7q4x6M3jQ" name="samsung-project-moohan-summit-2025-front" alt="A snapshot of Samsung's XR headset, Project Moohan, in a glass display case at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HPngbyiongeXT7q4x6M3jQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="866" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Elec)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.49%;"><img id="TnuGR3r3BvsgACyAF6TaiQ" name="samsung-project-moohan-summit-2025-inside-view" alt="A snapshot of Samsung's XR headset, Project Moohan, in a glass display case at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnuGR3r3BvsgACyAF6TaiQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="945" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Elec)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>All we can do now (for a little while longer) is speculate on the device's specs, which, according to some previous rumors, include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">Sony 4K micro-OLED displays. </a>This display could provide the XR headset with 3,552 × 3,840 resolution, 1,000-nit brightness, and 90fps capabilities.
