<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Docs is rolling out document tabs to let you break information in large documents into tidy sections for easy navigation.</li><li>To use tabs, just click the bullet-point button in the upper left corner and select "Show tabs" to start adding and managing them.</li><li>You can also create subtabs for deeper organization, diving into specific tasks or topics within your main tabs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Docs is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/tabs-in-google-docs.html" target="_blank">rolling out</a> a handy new feature that will simplify how you organize and access information in large documents, making navigation smoother than ever.</p><p>While using headings and the document outline is great for separating different sections, the new document tabs take things to the next level. They let you slice up info into neat sections, making it super easy to find your way around long texts. Tabs also speed up how you find what you need, turning the hassle of heavy documents into a smooth ride.</p><p>This feature will make it clear what a document is all about, helping writers, editors, and readers quickly grasp its structure, highlight key points, and locate specific sections easily.</p><p>To use the tabs feature in Docs on the web, just find the bullet-point button in the upper left corner of your document. When you hover over it, a tooltip will pop up saying "Show tabs." Clicking on the button will let you add and manage multiple tabs.</p><p>Every document starts with Tab 1, but you can add as many tabs as you want. To keep things clear and organized, you can rename these tabs from their default labels to something that actually makes sense by clicking the three-dot menu. Plus, you can rearrange tabs with a simple drag-and-drop.</p><p>To make it even easier to spot your tabs, you can add emojis to them. These emojis will show up to the left of the tab title in the left panel, taking the place of the default tab icon.</p><p>For even better organization, you can break tabs down into subtabs. This lets you dive into specific tasks or topics within a bigger picture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z3qpP5MfznPf9Ap7a74KF4" name="Google-Docs-tabs.gif" alt="Google Docs document tabs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z3qpP5MfznPf9Ap7a74KF4.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The feature lets you create up to three levels of nested subtabs. You can add these subtabs in two ways: either by choosing &apos;Add subtab&apos; from the tab options menu or by simply dragging one tab onto another, which will turn it into a subtab. Just like with the main tabs, you can label each subtab and add emojis for quick recognition.</p><p>The tab navigation menu pops up automatically when your document has two or more tabs. You can easily share links to specific tabs by clicking the three-dot menu next to each one. Plus, if you want to copy a tab, just use the &apos;Duplicate&apos; option in that same menu.</p><p>First <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/new-generative-ai-and-security-innovations" target="_blank">revealed in April of this year</a>, the tabs feature is now rolling out gradually to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> users, Google Workspace Individual subscribers, and those with personal Google accounts.</p>

<hr>
<p>Here&apos;s a surprising duo you never knew was coming: Amazon&apos;s Prime and Apple TV Plus.</p><p>Amazon announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/apple-tv-shows-amazon-prime-video-subscription">Newsroom post</a> that it will "soon" bring an Apple TV add-on to its Prime Video streaming service. The Senior Vice President and Head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, Mike Hopkins said in a statement, "... we are proud to welcome Apple TV+ and its popular and critically-acclaimed shows, films and events to Prime Video."</p><p>Hopkins also stated the inclusion of an Apple TV Plus add-on would give users a more "personalized" streaming experience with additional options.</p><p>The company highlighted shows like The Morning Show, Palm Royale, Shrinking, and Hijack. Additionally, it stated a host of Apple Original films joined the fray, including the movie CODA.</p><p>Sports lovers who already have Prime Video for the NFL&apos;s Thursday Night Football broadcasts can grab games from Apple TV Plus&apos; MLS Season Pass. The MLB is featured on the streaming service every Friday for its "Friday Night Baseball" featurette. This brings a double-header to subscribers every Friday.</p><p>Prime Video subscribers in the U.S. can grab the Apple TV Plus add-on for an extra $9.99 monthly. The subscription will roll out "later this month," letting users watch extra content across multiple devices. Moreover, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/apple-tv-plus-on-prime-video/?taid=6707c1e4d047f5000143f685&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Android Police</a> noted, Amazon&apos;s Apple TV Plus add-on helps relieve stress for Android. The streaming service didn&apos;t previously have any "native" support on Android, but this will rectify that in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>You may not remember, but Android TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tv-getting-apple-tv-app">launched an Apple TV app</a> back in 2020. Content is also available through Google TV; however, both avenues <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/tvplus/smart-tvs-and-streaming-devices-apda10aaed81/web">lack total support</a> as the app doesn&apos;t offer "purchases within the app." With the streaming service arriving soon on Prime Video, users will likely find a much smoother experience with the choice.</p><p>In July, Amazon announced the rollout of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-ui-content-changes">Prime Video UI redesign</a>. It came with a navigation bar full of pre-made options like "Prime," packed with content at no extra charge. Similarly, the bar features a section for add-on content. All subscription services tacked onto your already recurring Prime Video membership will appear beside the "Prime" icon.</p><p>Apple TV Plus will likely fall into this category if purchased. Additionally, scrolling over an add-on&apos;s icon will display what you were watching as its hero image. Amazon stated generative AI found its way into the redesign to give users "relevant content" if they&apos;re stuck on what to watch.</p>

<ul><li>Reports from Reddit state Samsung's October 2024 security update is arriving on AT&T and T-Mobile Galaxy S24 Ultra's in the U.S.</li><li>The update is around 443MB and delivers several "Critical" and "High" fixes from Samsung alongside Google's typical fixes.</li><li>A Samsung moderator recently stated users should expect a Public Beta program for One UI 7 (Android 15) later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s monthly security update is starting to hit its flagship series.</p><p>Users on the Galaxy S24 Ultra subreddit have reported the beginning of the October 2024 security update rollout. More specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1fzwhyh/october_security_patch_time_att_us/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">one user states</a> the update has reached the AT&T U.S. version of the latest Ultra model (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-october-2024-security-patch/?taid=6707a5a7d047f5000143f1a2&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Android Police</a>). It seems that all three devices are receiving this as the provided changelog snapshot shows three version numbers ending with "<strong>AXI1</strong>."</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1g0cbsr/tmobile_us_october_update_rolling_out/">users reported</a> the update has hit T-Mobile devices in the U.S. and Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s in the EU.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s patch notes shown on devices are quite light with the company only highlighting "improved security." However, the download arrives as a 442.22MB payload, pointing us toward Samsung&apos;s official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">updates board</a>.</p><p>The company lists two "Critical" fixes in October and 28 "High-level" corrections. Alongside a Samsung Semiconductor fix, the security patch includes a crucial fix for Knox Guard. Samsung states the fix should eliminate the possibility for "physical" hackers to bypass the security feature&apos;s defenses.</p><p>Several more fixes were included that solved "improper" access to the ActivityManager and more for "out-of-bounds" issues that plagued Android 12 to 14 devices.</p><p>On Google&apos;s side, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-10-01">Security Bulletin</a> states it provided three Framework fixes and four System fixes.</p>

<p>The update has started making its rounds today (Oct 10), meaning users may see it as the week closes. You can always manually check to download/install by hopping into <strong>Settings > Software Update > Download and Install.</strong></p><p>Samsung has been relatively quiet on the software front, which is staggering considering the delays around Android 15. While rumors suggest Google will launch the major update in October, Samsung says Galaxy lovers will have to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">wait until 2025</a>. The Korean OEM showcased its design overhaul planned for One UI 7 (Android 15) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">during SDC 2024</a> on a Galaxy S24 Ultra. Samsung plans to separate the notification panel and the Quick Settings menu in One UI 7.</p><p>Additionally, the entire rework seems more Apple-like as the Quick Settings takes on a curvier, rounded appearance with added customization.</p><p>It&apos;s not all bad as a Samsung moderator states users might see a Public Beta program begin later this year. It was mentioned in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-plans-one-ui-7-public-beta">a community forum post</a> asking about the subject as Samsung only mentioned developers during SDC. However, we&apos;re still waiting for "confirmation" on the schedule before we see the Public Beta begin.</p>

<p>Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra redefines what it means to have a slab phone on hand. The device drops its curved display for a completely flat experience embedded in a titanium frame with anti-glare technology. So, with 6.8 inches of prime real-estate, everything from scrolling to watching videos is immersive and fun.</p></p>

Purchase the Galaxy S24 Ultra directly from the source and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/buy/galaxy-s24-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s928uzkfxaa"><strong>you'll get a straight discount of up to $300 off</strong></a> (depending on the storage configuration), no strings attached and no trade-in required. That discount alone matches the expired Prime Day deal on the S24 Ultra, but it gets even better..</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/"><em><strong>See all the deals from Samsung's anti-Prime Day sale</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>For one, if you <em>do </em>have a device to trade in, Samsung is offering up to $750 off the S24 Ultra, plus you can get 30% dropped off the price of a Galaxy Watch 7 or Watch Ultra when you bundle the device with your new phone. As if those savings weren't enough, Samsung will also give you over $200 worth of free Adobe subscriptions and streaming trials. Not too shabby for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> that Samsung has ever produced.</p>

There's also $750 of trade-in credit up for grabs and a free $100 Samsung credit if you activate through your carrier. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/buy/galaxy-s24-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s928uzkfxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9cf20d24-82d4-455e-8830-f2768c75f3c2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Galaxy S24 Ultra" data-dimension48="Galaxy S24 Ultra" data-dimension25="$1119.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-early-samsung-galaxy-deals-phones-tablets-and-more">Samsung deals</a> are typically pretty complicated, so it's nice to see such a straightforward discount on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Another perk to buying the super-powered smartphone directly from Samsung is that you'll get access to a few color options not available anywhere else, such as Titanium Orange.</p><p>No matter which color you choose, you're getting a device that we called the "best Android phone in the US", with all of the sophisticated design, power, and innovative features that you could ever want in a flagship. You even get seven years of OS and security updates guaranteed, which means this could be your daily driver device for a good long while.</p><p>Indeed, the only real beef I've ever had with the Galaxy S24 Ultra is its price, but thanks to this leftover Prime Day, that's no longer such an issue.</p>

<p>Back in 1997, my Windows 95-era PC was graced with the honor of playing Bullfrog&apos;s classic strategy game, Dungeon Keeper, a game that would quickly become one of my favorite strategy titles of all time. While the 1999 sequel was bigger and badder, EA would later close Bullfrog Productions, erasing my hopes for a new Dungeon Keeper entry in the future.</p><p>Thankfully, there are other people like me, and that&apos;s how Underworld Overseer was born. Deisim developer Myron Games is one of them and has crafted a real gem of a Dungeon Keeper spiritual successor with Underworld Overseer for the Meta Quest platform — one that would be perfect for your shiny new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> when the game releases this Halloween.</p><p>Like Dungeon Keeper, you&apos;ll be building and maintaining a dungeon designed to attract underworld creatures of all sorts. From goblins to trolls, dark wizards, and imps, your job is to make the best dungeon possible for them to live in.</p><p>Of course, humans don&apos;t care much for these sorts of creatures and will regularly invade your dungeons in an effort to stamp out all forms of what they deem evil life and it&apos;s up to you to manage things in a way that keeps your denizens safe and prosperous, all with the power of your Meta Quest headset.</p>

<p>The moment I fired up the first early demo back in June, I was blown away by the visual quality of Underworld Overseer. To say this is the sharpest Meta Quest 3 game I&apos;ve ever played is no exaggeration. Units come to life in crisp detail that&apos;ll blow your mind when you see them up close, something that&apos;s particularly potent in VR when you can use your hands to pick up any unit and inspect it.</p><p>Not only that, but Underworld Overseer builds upon Myron&apos;s experience with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/deisim-for-oculus-quest-filled-the-void-in-my-heart-that-black-and-white-left" target="_blank">Deisim</a>, another excellent VR strategy title that feels a little bit like the PC classics Civilization and Black & White, albeit without the giant virtual pet roaming the lands.</p><p>Each of the game&apos;s 18 levels follows the same general gameplay loop. You&apos;ll start with a dungeon heart and a few imps. From here, you&apos;ll mark places for the imps to dig, carving out spaces for rooms and tunnels as you make your way through each of the hand-crafted areas. Some blocks store gold and riches that will be used to pay your dungeon&apos;s denizens — hey, they have to work for a living, too — while other treasures await discovery deeper in.</p>

<p>Underworld Overseer&apos;s controls are simple to understand with little to no learning curve, especially if you&apos;ve played any other VR strategy games. You can grab the world at any time with the grip buttons on the controller and move around, as well as use both hands to "pinch and zoom" with an inward or outward motion for better micromanagement. This comes in handy, particularly in the larger maps when you need to move around a lot to micromanage units, helping to bring in specialist combat units to deal with human intruders or move imps around for faster construction.</p><p>As you might expect from a VR strategy title, you can grab any unit in your dungeon for any reason. If any one unit is making you mad, it&apos;s easy to permanently dispose of them by picking them up and flinging them out of existence. Most of the time, though, you&apos;ll be using the grab tactic to move units around your dungeon for manual management, even though unit AI is quite smart. Units can only move so fast on their own, so being the godly figure you are, it makes a lot of sense to aid them with some micromanagement.</p>

<p>When you&apos;re not picking up units and moving them around the map, you&apos;ll be marking new areas for construction, moving gold around your storehouses, and digging deep to find treasures galore hidden in the depths of each map.</p><p>The game will take you around 12 hours to fully complete, but there&apos;s always the possibility that things may take longer depending on how much of a completionist you are. Plus, playing the game on both difficulty levels presents unique challenges as the hard mode essentially requires you to micromanage units, as battles are simply too difficult to allow units to move at their own pace.</p><p>There&apos;s even a speed run achievement for players willing to "think outside the box," as Myron puts it, which helps put the power of VR interaction to full use.</p>

<p>Some strategy games I&apos;ve played on the Quest do a good job of translating flat-screen mechanics to the VR medium, but Underworld Overseer feels like an entirely different breed of made-for-VR strategy. What&apos;s impressive is that it does this while still evoking the powerful sense of nostalgia that comes with classic PC strategy games, all without feeling too complicated or shoed-in to somehow feel doable in VR.</p><p>What&apos;s more is that the game is constantly exciting and I rarely ever found myself standing (or sitting) there just starting at my dungeon without something to do. This keeps the pacing right on point, something that can be painful to deal with in VR if a game is too slow.</p><p>If you&apos;re a fan of strategy games, I&apos;d highly recommend preordering Underworld Overseer on the Meta Horizon Store right now. You&apos;ll get a nice discount for preordering and be ready to dive in when it&apos;s scheduled to release later this month.</p>

<p>I didn&apos;t buy much this Prime Day as some of the things I was looking at weren&apos;t on sale. However, we did need a new air fryer, our old one is a bit janky. We opted for this Cosori in white and I&apos;m pretty excited about getting it. Getting an air fryer is actually incredibly great for your kitchen and you can make a lot of great meals. I think it looks especially clean and classy, too.</p><p><strong>* COSORI Pro Gen 2 Air Fryer</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/COSORI-Performance-Functions-Dishwasher-Safe-Detachable/dp/B0BD4BYR11?th=1"><del>$119</del> <strong>$99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The other thing I got wasn&apos;t on sale, unfortunately. I have been wanting one of these SpinWave mops because I&apos;ve heard some really good things. I&apos;ve also heard the cordless version isn&apos;t very good when it comes to battery life so I opted for the corded version even though it&apos;s not on sale. Since Bissell sends a portion of every sale to its pet foundation it&apos;s OK. I&apos;ll support any company that loves dogs as much as I do!</p><p><strong>* Bissell SpinWave PET Hard Floor Spin Mop: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bissell-SpinWave-Hard-Floor-20399/dp/B08HZFVNS7?th=1"><strong>$108 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>I purchased this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3RFXRL/">Audio-Technica Bluetooth Turntable</a> as sort of an impulse buy. Ever since my friend got a turntable a year ago, I&apos;ve been wanting one myself, mostly for the nostalgia of it all. This looked like the best option as it supports Bluetooth 5, Qualcomm AptX, and Hi-Fi audio, meaning I finally have a reason to dust off my Marshall speaker. I don&apos;t own any vinyl records right now, but many of my favorite artists have released their albums on vinyl, and I plan to start a collection.</p><p><strong>* Audio-Technica Fully Automatic Stereo Turntable:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3RFXRL/"><del>$219</del> <strong>$149 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

I’ve had my eye on these smart TVs for a while but wasn’t sure if they were too gimmicky or not. The idea is simple: you take a Samsung smart TV and give it an anti-glare display with a matte finish alongside a super-lightweight construction that sits flat against the wall. Once it’s installed, The Frame TV is supposed to look indistinguishable from a framed painting (when you use Art Mode, of course). I love the idea of not having an ugly TV hanging in my bedroom, and since Amazon is dropping 15% off the 43-inch model, it seemed worth a shot!</p><p><strong>* Samsung 43-Inch The Frame Series Smart TV:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV9HY4J9?th=1"><del>$997</del> <strong>$847 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<hr>
<p>Leaks suggest that a surprise Garmin Fenix 8 MicroLED edition might arrive relatively soon. We&apos;ve heard rumors for years that most major smartwatch makers want to replace OLED displays with MicroLEDs, so Garmin launching theirs before Apple and Samsung would be a major coup.</p><p>If this leak is accurate, the timing could royally piss off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">Garmin Fenix 8</a> buyers. But the evidence suggests Garmin won&apos;t pull off this win so easily.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2024/10/07/garmin-tactix-8-fenix-8/">Gadgets & Wearables</a> posted a screenshot of a list of "compatible devices" for developers making new Garmin watch faces. The list includes all recent Garmin AMOLED watches, but it has one exception: the "Garmin fēnix 8 MicroLED." It also includes another unannounced watch, the Garmin Tactix 8 AMOLED, which would ship in 47mm and 51mm case sizes.</p><p>Last month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2024/09/10/garmin-microled/">Gadgets & Wearables</a> posted another alleged leak, showing the Garmin Connect app page that appears when you add a new device. The list includes the Garmin Fenix 8 MicroLED and the Fenix 8 Pro 47mm / 51mm. Those devices don&apos;t appear in the current app version, but they may have been removed.</p>

<p>MicroLED supplier Vuzix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ir.vuzix.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/2081/garmin-collaborates-with-vuzix-to-develop-next-generation">announced</a> a partnership with Garmin in May 2024 for a "next generation nano-imprinted waveguide-based display system" with MicroLED tech, but waveguide displays are specifically for transparent lenses like the ones in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vuzix.com/products/vuzix-shield-smart-glasses">Vuzix Shield AR glasses</a>. Garmin makes several products for truck drivers, and AR glasses with directional tech would fit that description better.</p><p>It&apos;s possible that Vuzix would pull double duty and make MicroLED display tech for Garmin watches. We simply have no evidence that&apos;s the company&apos;s area of expertise, or that Garmin has <em>another</em> MicroLED partner to use.</p><p>MicroLED display tech is meant to match or beat the visual quality and brightness of an AMOLED display without needing a backlight. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> are beloved for their long battery life, but the company&apos;s pivot from battery-saving MIP to brighter AMOLEDs is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">controversial</a> with long-time users. MicroLED probably wouldn&apos;t come close to MIP for efficiency, but it would bridge the longevity gap.</p>
<h2 id="an-incredible-microled-turnaround-if-true-2">An incredible MicroLED turnaround, if true</h2>
<p>First, the positives: If (and it&apos;s a big if) Garmin is selling a MicroLED watch this year or next, it would be at a pace that will make Apple and Samsung jealous.</p><p>Samsung allegedly "started to commercialize MicroLED technology for smartwatches" in 2023 according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-making-microled-displays-for-smartwatches/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, with "hopes to complete the development within this year." Then another report suggested Samsung wanted to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-micro-led-rumor">use a MicroLED display in the Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> in 2024. </p><p>Either the reports were false or Samsung realized it couldn&apos;t affordably insert the tech into its watches yet. It does sell MicroLED TVs...that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is already expensive enough with its current display, and the 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> should stick to AMOLED.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Both Apple and Samsung gave their flagship watches 3,000-nit AMOLED displays </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;ve also heard competing rumors for years about Apple&apos;s MicroLED plans. After analysts claimed it would arrive in 2024 or 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/apple-scraps-plan-to-design-display-for-watch-in-house-cuts-jobs">Bloomberg</a> reported that Apple gave up on its MicroLED plans for the Apple Watch in March 2024. Just this week, however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/10/06/apple-hasnt-abandoned-microled-tech-despite-recent-setbacks">Appleinsider</a> claimed that Apple intends to sell a microLED Ultra watch in 2026. The reports make Apple sound indecisive about the idea.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-reportedly-buying-microled-display-maker-raxium-for-its-ar-push">bought MicroLED supplier Raxium</a> in 2022, with the assumption that it would use the tech for AR glasses — possibly the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra AR glasses</a> we saw at Google I/O 2024. But in theory, Google could follow in Samsung&apos;s footsteps and use MicroLED displays in a Pixel Watch.</p><p>The through line here is that big tech brands see MicroLED as the future of smartwatch and AR glasses display tech, but are having trouble implementing it quickly. If Vuzix had product-ready MicroLED tech for Garmin watches less than a year after its announced partnership, that would be unusually fast.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-just-released-the-fenix-8-2">Garmin JUST released the Fenix 8</h2>
<p>Let&apos;s ignore the industry evidence that MicroLED probably isn&apos;t ready for any smartwatch, and that if Garmin were to sell a Fenix 8 MicroLED, it would probably be prohibitively expensive, maybe on par with its luxury MARQ watches that cost $2–3,000, if not higher.</p><p>Suppose Garmin really did pull off a coup and sells a new Fenix 8 MicroLED soon. The timing would be brutal to everyone who spent anywhere from $999 to $1,199 on a brand-new AMOLED watch, not realizing there&apos;d be an even better option a few months away. (I assume the Fenix 8 MIP Solar buyers won&apos;t mind as much.)</p><p>This would also apply if the leaked Fenix 8 Pro arrives soon, since Garmin usually waits a year between a base Fenix and its mid-cycle refresh. If you&apos;re spending that much on a watch, you want to feel like you have the best possible option with every new software feature for a year or more, not a few months.</p><p>Aside from a few minor launches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-lily-2-active-launch-details">Lily 2 Active</a>, we probably won&apos;t see any more major Garmin launches in 2024. But a spring 2025 launch of any new Garmin Fenix 8 would raise eyebrows and generate FOMO in Garmin&apos;s biggest spenders.</p><p>But I&apos;ll return to my original point: Whether or not Garmin plans to sell a Fenix 8 MicroLED, I&apos;m skeptical it can pull it off quickly. And as a Fenix 8 owner, I&apos;d have some complicated emotions if Garmin bucks expectations.</p>
<h2 id="update-does-garmin-already-have-a-prototype-2">UPDATE: Does Garmin already have a prototype?</h2>
<p>After publishing this post, an "Anon fitness application developer" contacted my colleague Jerry Hildenbrand and asked him to forward this message: "Garmin has prototype Fenix 8 MICROLED watches that it showed to developers under NDA. I&apos;ve held one. It doesn&apos;t appear any different at a glance and app compatibility changes seemed minimal. I also know it was said to be prohibitively expensive to produce and is likely a future project."</p><p>We have no way of confirming if this claim is true, to be clear. But the key point, that it&apos;s "likely a future project" and a "prototype," would make sense. Garmin might have added the watch to Connect in order to test and show off features to devs, but with no intention of bringing it to market in the <em>immediate</em> future. Fenix 8 AMOLED buyers can probably rest easy.</p><p>The source used my phrase "prohibitively expensive," which tracks with what we know of MicroLED production right now: it doesn&apos;t scale easily, some work needs to be done by hand, and it probably costs about triple the current market production cost for displays. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240317PD200/vuereal-canada-startup-micro-led-ams-osram-apple-watch.html" target="_blank">Digitimes interview</a> does a great job running through the current issues with MicroLED.</p><p>High costs would obviously scare off Apple and Samsung, which target mainstream watch buyers, but Garmin is used to selling high-end luxury models to a niche audience. So, in theory, we could see a Garmin Fenix 8 MicroLED in the future, if you&apos;re willing to spend a couple months of rent money on it! And it may not be anytime soon.</p>

<hr>
<p>Android devices run a specific aesthetic that the software can deploy automatically, but one app never adhered to those rules.</p><p>Google was spotted rolling out an update for the Pixel Buds app that brings a closer pairing between it and Android 13&apos;s (and higher) Material You. Known Android deep diver <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1843582603988697190">AssembleDebug</a> posted on X that the app is picking up a themed icon (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-buds-app-material-you-dynamically-themed-icon/?taid=670638217aa340000121a69c&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Android Police</a>).</p><p>In version 1.0.680489030, users will notice that, if "themed icons" are enabled, the Pixel Buds app will take on whatever color is selected. The Pixel Buds app is a huge part of its Pixel ecosystem and has only recently fallen in line with Google&apos;s classic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You</a> design language.</p><p>Users can hop into their "personalization" settings on their Android device to enable/disable themed icons. Additionally, users have begun listing the other apps Google has yet to give the same treatment. Play Games, Opinion Rewards, and Google Translate were among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/buttermilkoreo/status/1843623053701333085">those mentioned</a>.</p><p>We have yet to notice the update appear on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Moto Edge Plus 2023</a>, so it&apos;s likely still making its rounds to Android devices. Continue to check and update your apps as not every device will see simultaneously.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Pixel Buds app finally gets a themed icon ☠️Version • 1.0.680489030 Apkmirror - https://t.co/PSZx1oOzJW pic.twitter.com/PH6pyN9LAg<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1843582603988697190">October 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Despite this minimalistic design update for the Pixel Buds app, Google is seemingly preparing more for earbud enjoyers. A report from September showed that Google is working to bring the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-noise-control-option-audio-mode-return">Noise Control</a>" panel back to Android 15. This redesigned panel would let users swap quickly between ANC (active noise cancelation) and transparency mode on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> or O.G. Buds Pro.</p><p>The panel will merge a convenient floating menu with the Pixel Buds app&apos;s capabilities. The early discovery shows that users will (likely) have to tap the "Spatial Audio" option in the panel, which will bring up a smaller Noise Control panel provided by the Buds app.</p><p>This information was highlighted based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2</a>.

<hr>
<p>Honor and Google teamed up to bring Circle Search to the Magic V3 and Honor 200 series, making searching quicker and easier on these devices.</p><p>Honor calls the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a> the world’s thinnest inward-foldable phone, and it made its global debut last month at IFA in Berlin. It first launched in China back in August, where Honor hinted at new AI features like AI Eraser, Face-to-Face Translation, and Notes Live Translation for the foldable.</p><p>Today&apos;s announcement means the Honor Magic V3 is ready to throw down against Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> with the addition of Circle to Search. The AI search feature is also coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200</a> series later this year.</p><p>Honor sees AI as a key part of future living and is committed to its development through continuous research and teamwork in the industry, as per the company&apos;s press release. To help get AI into more hands, the company introduced its Four-layer AI Architecture, which combines on-device AI with cloud capabilities to enhance security through the company&apos;s Personal Cloud Compute.</p><p>Google first rolled out its AI-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> with the Samsung Galaxy S24 series in January, followed by the Pixel 8 lineup in February. By August, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-affordable-phones-and-tablets-are-picking-up-circle-to-search">expanded to mid-range Samsung devices too</a>.</p><p>Circle to Search makes finding info on your device super easy. Just draw a circle around an object in a photo or a word in text with your finger, and it instantly identifies it, bringing up relevant search results.</p><p>Our own Nicholas Sutrich recently revealed that Circle to Search is also heading to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-fold-2-review">Tecno Phantom V Fold 2</a>, which might mean other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android phones</a> from more OEMs could get in on this awesome search tool soon too.</p><p>Adding Circle to Search definitely boosts the appeal of the new Honor device. But we&apos;ll have to wait and see if it can live up to all the hype it’s been getting.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Parallels for ChromeOS, which lets Chromebooks run Windows apps, might soon be shutting down.</li><li>A new report highlights that there haven't been major updates for about 18 months, hinting at dwindling interest from Google.</li><li>After a promising start, the project has been stagnant, with the last significant update in mid-2022 for lower-end Intel and AMD chipsets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems Parallels for ChromeOS, the service that enables Chromebooks to run Windows apps, is on the verge of closing up shop.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/leaks-confirm-parallels-on-chromebooks-is-dead-in-the-water/" target="_blank">Chrome Unboxed</a>, there haven&apos;t been any major updates to Parallels on Chromebooks for about eighteen months. This points to a possible decrease in the company&apos;s interest in the project.</p><p>Once just a pipe dream, running Windows on a Chromebook became a reality in 2020 when Google teamed up with Parallels to bring both Android and Windows apps to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Parallels Desktop is a virtualization software that allows you to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single computer. Mac users often use it to run Windows applications on their Apple devices.</p><p>While the project had a strong start, it’s been stuck in a lull for quite some time. The latest noteworthy update came in mid-2022, when Parallels was improved to work with budget-friendly Intel and AMD chipsets.</p><p>The long stretch without updates, along with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/cameyo-virtual-app-delivery-windows-apps">Google’s recent purchase of Cameyo</a>, which mentioned bringing virtual Windows apps to ChromeOS as a key reason, foreshadowed a potential change in direction for the project.</p><p>With the limited focus and various challenges it&apos;s facing, it’s no shock that Parallels Desktop could be heading for the chopping block soon.</p><p>While Parallels-on-Chromebook provides a practical way to run legacy apps on ChromeOS, it comes with some ironic challenges. One major issue is that you need a high-performance Chromebook to make the virtual desktop work, which kind of goes against the budget-friendly appeal that Chromebooks are known for.</p><p>Rumor has it that Google has decided to shut down the Parallels-on-Chromebook initiative. Users can expect to get official word on this soon, with a formal announcement likely coming before the end of the year.</p><p>Additionally, it seems that Parallels for ChromeOS will also be phased out by year&apos;s end, although a specific date hasn’t been revealed yet.</p>
