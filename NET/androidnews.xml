But they can confirm that, "At the moment, we do not expect a launch in 2025."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tktjukwZRiF8zyjEbTsqCQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-wearing.jpg" alt="Wearing the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tktjukwZRiF8zyjEbTsqCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Given that the Ring is still under development, folks at Galaxy Club feel that the smart ring could likely show up along with the Korean OEM's next flagship model — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series, or later.</p><p>That said, we have been privy to a few Galaxy Ring 2 rumors in the past couple of months, and most of them point to a potential design change. "Some time ago we also saw a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/samsung-patent-toont-galaxy-ring-met-flexibel/">patent application for a design</a> with a flexible design that ensures that sensors fit better around your finger," the website added.</p><p>In March, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/next-galaxy-ring-could-come-with-sensors-to-measure-body-and-surface-temperatures">we heard </a>that the Galaxy Ring 2 could potentially come with new sensors that measure not just the surface but also the body temperatures of the user, as well as others.</p><p>Additionally, we heard that the new ring might also sport motion sensors such as an accelerometer and gyroscope.

This feature helps users switch between two apps with a single tap, without feeling like the app is squished up when the screen is split. Samsung's Weather app, Reminder, Health, and Auracast also receive major updates with this new release.</p><p>Considering the rollout of the new Beta has just begun, we can expect Samsung to gradually announce more beta versions and compatibility for additional devices.

For about the same price, you could go with a foldable from Motorola or a flagship, non-folding phone from Samsung. When making the comparison between the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, the difference is clear if you know which basic design you want. However, if you’re not yet sure, you might be weighing the pros and cons of both, as these are two very impressive phones for their respective categories.</p><p>We’re here to help by running through how they stack up against one another in all the most important ways.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-the-design-and-basic-features-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: The design and basic features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xFNMPhveqeXd67tk9F6JRC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-37" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 outside in tent mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFNMPhveqeXd67tk9F6JRC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3963" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you think you automatically get a significantly larger screen with the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 since it’s a foldable, think again. The inner screen is indeed an oversized 7 inches, but that’s only marginally larger than the size of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. With that said, the advantage with this phone is that you can also fold it down to half its size and still enjoy the outer 4-inch screen for crucial notifications, selfies, apps, and more.</p><p>The larger inner screen is a punchy and crisp 1,224p AMOLED HDR10+ Super HD with adaptive 165Hz refresh rate, 4,500 nits peak brightness, and is Pantone-validated for ultra-accurate colors and skin tones. The external screen, meanwhile, is a P-OLED HDR10+ 417ppi screen with an adaptive 165Hz refresh rate, as well as a slightly lower peak brightness of up to 3,000 nits.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes in several colors</a>, including Pantone colors Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Train, and Cabaret, as well as the option for a luxe satin-inspired finish or durable leather-inspired finish. Derrek Lee says in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">review of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> that he loves the brushed metal versus glossy frame, advising that it affords a “rustic sheen.”</p><p>There’s also Italian Alcantara if you’re feeling extra special. If you’re not familiar with that material, it’s the same type used for luxury items like bags from Louis Vuitton or premium cars. Finally, opt for an FSC-certified wood housing if you want something a bit more rustic. Bottom line: you get options <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">not just with colors but materials</a>, too.

The hinge is reinforced with titanium, making it strong and able to withstand frequent folding and unfolding throughout its life, more so than the company’s previous generation devices. Lee says it springs open with a satisfying click and is noticeably stronger and easier to open.</p><p>While you only have a limited view of content on the external screen, you can customize it to your liking through the use of dedicated panels. These are available for contacts, apps, streaming music, weather updates, and more. Speaking of music, when listening, watching videos, or on a call, you can leverage the stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support and three mics.</p><p>Get it with either 512GB or 1TB storage to load it up with essentials and more. The 5G phone recharges via USB-C and comes equipped with a 4,700mAh battery that supports 68W TurboPower charging, allowing for a full charge in just 40 minutes. You also get quick wireless charging at 30W and can use 5W reverse charging for other devices in a pinch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xWNKtwfwBxmw69wGtikRAh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-06" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xWNKtwfwBxmw69wGtikRAh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Introduced earlier in 2025, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is not a foldable phone, but it boasts a screen size of almost 6.9 inches, comparable to the fully opened Motorola Razr Ultra 2025. You get a higher-resolution Quad HD+ (3,120 x 1,440) Dynamic AMOLED 2x display, but a lesser 120Hz refresh rate. Peak brightness is just 2,600 nits, which is still decent for viewing in bright sunlight. In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">review of the Samsung Galaxy Ultra S25</a>, Andrew Myrick says the screen looks “absolutely stunning.”</p><p>The S25 Ultra is available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-color-should-you-buy">a few more color options</a> than the Razr, including Silverblue, Black, Gray, Whitesilver, and the Samsung-exclusive Jetblack, Jadegreen, and Pinkgold. The phone is built with a strong titanium frame alongside Corning Gorilla Glass Armor 2. It meets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-waterproof">IP68 specifications</a>, making it more resistant to dust and water.</p><p>While this phone isn’t a foldable, it does come with a built-in S-Pen you can use for productivity and creativity tasks. Myrick says he loves the uniform design with flat edges “as far as the eye can see.” But while he says it feels great to hold and use, he admits that it’s also slippery, lacking grip. Once again, a protective case is essential.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-good-lock-one-ui-7-multitasking-01" alt="The grid multitasking UI from a Good Lock module in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Along with support for Dolby Atmos through its stereo speakers, you get 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB storage, affording an entry option for those who don’t require as much storage (though it’s always recommended to get more than you think you’d need).</p><p>The 5,000mAh battery should last all day, and while this phone supports wireless charging, it’s only at half the speed of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025.

All these functions are supported by the 12GB RAM, which is not as much as the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, but a step above some more premium phones.</p><p>Along with all the AI goodies, you can enjoy top-notch security through on-device protection and Samsung Knox Security. Andrew's one issue with this phone, when it comes to usability, is that he misses having the external screen of a foldable, which he has found to be invaluable for multitasking.</p><p>One area where the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra excels is in terms of longevity. With this phone, you’ll get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-get">seven years of OS and security updates</a>, which will take you right through to Android 22 and 2032. With the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, you’ll only get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">three years of major OS updates</a> through Android 18 and four years of security updates. While you’re unlikely to hold onto a phone for longer than that anyway, it significantly reduces hand-me-down and resale or trade-in value.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-photography-prowess-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Photography prowess</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="fMtcdJtF4cj67Te2jpS3VB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-07" alt="Holding the Razr Ultra 2025 outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMtcdJtF4cj67Te2jpS3VB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3864" height="2174" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, you get a triple 50MP camera system consisting of a main 50MP camera, a 12.6MP quad-pixel ultra-wide camera with Macro Vision, and a front camera with a whopping 50MP resolution.</p><p>Derrek says the primary sensor takes great photos, even at just 2x zoom, with punchy colors thanks to the collaboration with Pantone.

Now, it's a product you can actually use as Gemini Live on millions of smartphones — both iOS and Android devices. However, there's a lot more to Project Astra than the live video and screen sharing capabilities that recently became available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> users.</p><p>Focused initially on bringing versatile, multimodal AI capabilities to Android, Project Astra has evolved into a far-reaching research project aimed at achieving Google's vision for a universal AI assistant. That means Project Astra is working on key AI features like agentic intelligence, native audio, memory, accessibility, tool use, and much more.</p><p>In other words, the upgraded Gemini Live experience isn't the finish line for Project Astra — it's just the beginning. If you're curious about all Project Astra encompasses and how it'll affect platforms like Android and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, you're in the right place. Let's break down everything you need to know about Project Astra and how you can try it now.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-project-astra-what-is-it"><span>Project Astra: What is it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5953px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="h3HBCreJv6uMev4xjqHrpE" name="Project-Astra-1" alt="The Project Astra sign at Google I/O 2024." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h3HBCreJv6uMev4xjqHrpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5953" height="3969" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Project Astra is known for a few high-profile applications already, but Google's definition of the project is simple. It's a "research prototype exploring breakthrough capabilities for Google products — on the way to building a universal AI assistant," according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/models/project-astra/" target="_blank">Project Astra website</a>.</p><p>That's a vague explanation of Project Astra, and it's probably on purpose. While the project began as a vector for testing multimodal Gemini support for live audio and video, it's expanded to become much more. Now, parts of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">Project Astra are operating under the Gemini app arm at Google</a>, like the ones working on Gemini Live. Others are still working on experimental prototypes and applications for Google DeepMind.</p><p>Here are a few Project Astra features and applications we currently know about:</p><ul><li>Multimodal live video and screen sharing support (Gemini Live)</li><li>Native audio dialogue</li><li>Proactive responses without lag or interruption</li><li>Context-aware dialogue</li><li>Agent highlighting that understands the context of your device screen</li><li>Tool use and interface control to complete actions on your behalf</li><li>Personalized reasoning specific to the user</li><li>Content retrieval from the web or past interactions</li><li>Multimodal memory</li><li>Visual Interpreter to support the blind and low-vision community</li><li>Integration with prototype Android XR glasses</li></ul><p>Currently, many of these features are still in the prototype stage and are only available to select testers. The big exception is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">Gemini Live</a>, which we'll talk about in detail later.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-project-astra-how-it-works"><span>Project Astra: How it works</span></h2><p>Project Astra is a tweaked version of Gemini with enhanced multimodal and agentic capabilities. For trusted testers, Project Astra is available as a standalone app. It works by utilizing multiple knowledge sources and advanced reasoning to provide more comprehensive assistance than a typical search engine or AI chatbot. This could include Gemini models, information found on the web, visual or auditory cues, data that's on your screen, or personalized knowledge from your Google activity or past interactions.</p><p>It works by quickly processing all these data points at once, and the result is Project Astra being able to communicate with a user in natural language with accurate context. This is achieved by using native audio dialogue that can understand different accents and emotions in 24 languages.</p><p>Newly announced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">Google I/O 2025</a> are Project Astra's agentic capabilities. In other words, the prototype AI assistant will soon be able to take actions on your behalf. It can understand what's on your screen in the context of your conversation, using visual cues to show you where to look. It can also utilize Google features such as Search, Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and more to complete tasks on your behalf.</p><p>You can see this in action in the I/O demo video for Project Astra, which demonstrates how a user can control their phone and solve daily problems hands-free.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JcDBFAm9PPI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>We see the person in the video asking Project Astra to find manuals, highlight key points in PDF files, and call businesses on their behalf. This is a perfect, real-world example of Google's vision for Project Astra. In the end, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-vision-world-model-explained">universal AI assistant</a> should be able to control your phone — and perhaps your computer or smart glasses — without you needing to lift a finger.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-project-astra-features-and-platforms"><span>Project Astra: Features and platforms</span></h2><p>The long-term goal is for Project Astra to expand to multiple platforms, and for now, Google has its sights on smartphones and smart glasses. The company says that this prototype "integrates seamlessly with prototype glasses to see the world as you see it — for an even more immersive and helpful experience."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-5" alt="Android XR prototype glasses and Pixel smartphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After trying the experience on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">prototype Android XR glasses at Google I/O</a>, it's clear Astra aims to bring everything we've already covered — including multimodality, memory, visual analysis, and agentic control — to a wearable form factor.

You can also share your screen to talk about what's currently on your smartphone.

The document details the EU's "Ecodesign Regulation," which will soon begin to force smartphone OEMs to provide five years of updates (at minimum) for their devices and consumers.</p><p>There's speculation that this regulation could have a lasting impact on how smartphone makers provide updates globally, too.</p><p>Now, there's a major note to be taken here with this new information: this new five-year rule applies to OS and security updates <em>after </em>"the end of sales." This new rule will also reportedly involve tablets, too. As the publication notes, the change is likely to encourage more "certainty" for consumers when using their devices over a prolonged period.</p><p>This new rule is set to go into effect on June 20, 2025. However, the EU's rules will <em>not </em>apply to devices produced/launched before this date. Any phones and tablets that hit the market after June 20 will have to follow the EU's updated policy.</p><h2 id="android-updates-for-users-2">Android Updates for Users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TV3t5LMRSBccRMwNn8WG6h" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-update-01" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TV3t5LMRSBccRMwNn8WG6h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, the EU's new regulations set for June 20 include some Energy Labelling requirements, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/eu-new-rules-will-shake-up-android-update-policies/">Android Police</a>. These eco-friendly design rules for devices in the EU require manufacturers to state how tough their phones/tablets are to drops/dust/water and to ensure their batteries are strong enough to "withstand 800 charge and discharge cycles while retaining at least 80% of their initial capacity."</p><p>Repairability of a device is also required to be stated by OEMs. Moreover, makers should make sure parts for repair are available for at least "7 years after the end of sales of the product model on the EU market."</p><p>It's worth remembering that Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">just like Samsung</a>, has shifted to a seven-year update cycle for devices. While this is a nice thing, especially when it announced such an endeavor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">for the Galaxy S24 series</a>, one thing rings true: hardware is forever.

Does that mean they hear everything around them all of the time?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p><p>Hi Rob. That's a great question that I think a lot of people wonder about: how much does their smartphone or "smart" device actually hear?</p><p>The easy answer is everything. Yes, <em>Always Listening</em> means just that — it is always listening. It has to so it can recognize when its trigger word or phrase was spoken, then it can try to do something useful. This means that all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-integrates-gemini-for-smarter-home-automation" target="_blank">smart home</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-home-compatible-devices" target="_blank">assistant-powered devices</a> from every company, including Amazon, Google, and Apple, must work this way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HoTM2nNJVAhKsstdBNfEY3" name="Nest-Hub-2nd-gen.jpg" alt="Nest Hub next to a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HoTM2nNJVAhKsstdBNfEY3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The better answer is to explain how it's supposed to work, according to the people who make the products and those who have tested them. Always listening doesn't mean always recognizing or always doing something. I'll use a simple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-mini-vs-amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen">Nest Mini</a> as an example, but as mentioned, this is pretty much the same across all ecosystems and platforms. Any sort of AI or assistant on your phone has to work this way.</p><p>As soon as you plug in and set up a Nest Mini, its microphone goes to work. Every sound that it picks up is analyzed using some low-power software and hardware, and unless you've said "Hey Google", that's the end of it.</p><p>If it <em>does</em> think it's picked up its command phrase, other processing starts to happen. The software tries to interpret the words it has heard into commands the device can recognize, and then tries to act on those commands.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="byQxwxMvsUNpH4Ji9er97S" name="Govee-RGBIC-LED-Strip-Lights.jpeg" alt="Govee RGBIC LED Strip Lights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/byQxwxMvsUNpH4Ji9er97S.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>An example is if I say, "Hey Google, turn off the porch light," My Nest Mini catches the phrase Hey Google so it knows it needs to process what comes next. In this case, it uses speech recognition to determine my request, ensures it recognizes a device named "porch light," and then sends a signal to shut it off.</p><p>If it didn't recognize the key phrase of "Hey Google," it would just keep listening for it.</p><p>If it recognized its key phrase but was unable to figure out what was being asked, or if it were asked to do something it couldn't, it would respond with a generic error like "I'm sorry I don't recognize porch light" or "I'm sorry I can't do that".</p><p>If it "thought" it recognized the key phrase, it would try to figure out what to do next as described above. Usually, it can't do anything because we never really asked it to do anything. In that case, it just goes back to listening. But sometimes, it can be goofy and <em>think</em> it found a command and do something you never asked it to do.</p><p>I have a first-generation Google Home here that will start playing YouTube videos out of the blue at least three times a week because it thinks I asked it to do it. Goofy little gadget.</p><h2 id="what-about-privacy-2">What about privacy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA" name="google-nest-mini-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Nest Mini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tech companies are very specific about what their voice-activated devices will do and how they do it. That's good because having something that hears everything could be a little problematic if not kept on a short leash.</p><p>For example, some of the commands it "hears" are recorded and sent back for someone to check. If it was told to turn off the porch light, someone wants to make sure it did turn off the porch light. It does keep track of everything it hears that it thinks is a valid request for a certain amount of time. Some think that this information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/cox-media-group-active-listening-controversy">is sold to advertisers</a>, though the companies making the smart devices say otherwise.</p><p>If it heard something that wasn't a valid request, it won't keep track of it, according to the companies who make them.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fANtCWfwKDAUisnEp6zesm" name="google-pixel-fold-google-assistant.jpg" alt="Google Assistant on a Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fANtCWfwKDAUisnEp6zesm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, this is a very valid privacy concern. Most people don't want Google to spy on everything they say. I know I don't. Not that I'm saying or doing something I shouldn't be (you never know) but it's the fact that it's none of Google's damn business.</p><p>You really only have two choices: trust that it's doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing by only processing and acting on things it thinks are valid requests, or don't. I can't tell you what to choose here, but if you don't trust it, you should totally not use it.</p><p>Myself? I only ever fully trust something I built with my own two hands while I'm using it myself. I do use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant" target="_blank"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini" target="_blank">Gemini</a>, and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini" target="_blank"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> products, but I'm mindful of where, when, and how. I'd never have one in my bedroom, for example. <em>Especially</em> one with a camera. I do not use any voice-activated smart "stuff" through Apple, Microsoft, or Amazon because I only want to worry about one platform getting more than I want to share.</p><p>You probably shouldn't follow my example and decide if you trust it or not, then go from there. Giant tech companies don't care about you as a person, but are almost assuredly doing exactly what they describe with voice-controlled services and products. Not to be kind, but because it's not worth the problems that would arise if they got caught doing something differently.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If it faces upward, it could support selfies, face authentication, or video calling; if it points outwards, it could take photos, though not with very good resolution quality.</p><p>We assume the HMD Rubber 1S is the budget model, with a 1.07-inch OLED display, 290mAh battery, Bluetooth 5.0, and no NFC or built-in camera.

The biggest downside is probably the headphones' high price tag, so snagging them for under $300 is a certifiably good deal.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="bf246e4d-5080-4f2b-b18a-90893bb54fa3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: $399.99" data-dimension48="Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: $399.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want industry-leading ANC, EQ, and overall audio quality; you need wireless headphones with a mic and clear call quality; you'd like to have headphones with a long battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you prefer a pair of headphones that can be easily folded and stored; you want headphones that will let you charge and listen at the same time; you'd rather spend more on the new Sony WH-1000XM6.</p><p>Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones are our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones#section-best-overall">best wireless headphones </a>for a number of reasons. Backed by Sony's QN1 processor and a dual-noise sensor, the WH-1000XM5s have ANC audio blocking that's more powerful than those of competitors, and the Sony Connect app makes it easy to customize EQ and the overall audio profile.</p><p>These also include multi-point connection, a battery life of up to 30 hours per charge, and fast-charging through a USB-C cable that adds roughly three hours of playback for every three minutes they charge. Additionally, their suite of four microphones allow for crisp call quality and easy access to voice assistants. It is worth noting that these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">noise-cancelling headphones</a> aren't particularly easy to store away, though this isn't a big deal for most buyers.</p><p>Needless to say, if you don't mind spending a pretty penny on the latest headphones from Sony, the recently-released XM6 are the better pick. But if you want premium headphone technology at an excellent price, skip the newer cans and grab the XM5 today.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It doesn't seem as though this "shortcut" will throw Pixel users into their Now Playing history. Instead, according to the tipster's findings, this button will reside in the Quick Settings pull-down menu.</p><p>After getting it to work, the tipster claims users will be able to tap this button to immediately begin their Pixel's song identification capabilities. When engaged, the shortcut assumes whatever color your Material You theme is to indicate its activation.</p><p>Moreover, the tipster noticed that Google is working on a persistent notification that says "Searching for song..."</p><h2 id="pixels-android-2">Pixels & Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="jmuFbze4VgVDnocNepn8LZ" name="google-pixel-now-playing-notification-example-leak" alt="A snapshot of Google's supposed now playing shortcut's notification, which may show users that it's "Searching for song..."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jmuFbze4VgVDnocNepn8LZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's still more to come with this feature, as the publication states the most important part (song discovery) wasn't working. At face value, it seems like this persistent notification will morph into the song's name alongside the artist and maybe its album title, too. It's still too early to tell, despite Google's development of the shortcut seemingly far in its process.</p><p>As previously stated, Pixel users currently have their Now Playing history to dive into if they have this feature active. If your device is listening for music, it will identify and list those songs on that page. Users can then "heart" their favorite songs or interact with them to receive a YouTube, YouTube Music, or Spotify link. If Google is working on a shortcut for this, one that you manually activate for quicker info, maybe these links will be more forward-facing/present to use.</p><p>Something that might impact more than just Pixel users is Google's apparent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/gmails-new-material-3-expressive-design-is-secretly-hitting-some-inboxes">Material 3 Expressive redesign for Gmail</a>. Some users have reportedly already noticed an entire rework of the layout. Emails will supposedly sit on a dedicated card for added depth. Additionally, the changes seem to facilitate room for more colors, delivering a Gmail UI that is a little more <em>expressive</em>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xrrom-android-16-to-android-xr">which is what Google wants</a>.</p><p>During I/O 2025, the company discussed its biggest UI overhaul, Material 3 Expressive. The whole purpose of this new direction is to design a language that "feels good, makes sense, and helps you do things with ease." More than that, it seems like this will arrive for Android 16, and that's expected to happen in June.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thinness is the name of the game for the S25 Edge and, according to Nelson's research, the phone is "a tad over three-quarters" thick. On the Moh Scale of Hardness test, the device's screen begins displaying scratches at a level 6 before becoming more apparent (and deep) on level 7.</p><p>The titanium sides scratch pretty easily, at least with a sharp box cutter involved. Additionally, Nelson was able to pop the volume and power buttons off the S25 Edge quite easily with it.</p><p>The durability test moves on to some heartache as Nelson scratches up the in-display fingerprint sensor before taking a flame to the screen. For the former, even when scratched quite rigorously, the S25 Edge is still capable of scanning/reading your assigned fingerprint (or thumbprint). Interestingly, after 30 seconds under a lighter, the S25 Edge's display showed no signs of damage.</p><p>More than that, the device surprisingly survived Zach Nelson's bend test. However, Nelson briefly touches on a small compromise to the device's water resistance during this bend test. So check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/yQHFCpO6gHE">the rest of the durability test</a> to see that, and a little about the compromises Samsung had to settle for on this thin phone.</p><h2 id="almost-30-days-later-2">Almost 30 days later</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQHFCpO6gHE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Samsung dropped the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> on May 12, and the device became the fourth official member of the new series. From the leaks to Samsung's official in-person teaser of the device, everyone knew the S25 Edge was designed to be an "even-thinner" phone. Samsung's goal was to strike a balance in power and a premium design despite shaving off a little more.</p><p>The S25 Edge debuted with a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, and a 200MP wide-angle lens.</p><p>Like Zach Nelson also highlighted, the display is akin to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's; however, it lacks much of the glare resistance we've come to enjoy. Moreover, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">in our hands-on</a>, the Galaxy S25 Edge seemed to fare quite well. It was better than expected, but that doesn't mean everything was good, especially with its longevity. Speaking plainly, the Galaxy S25 Edge compromises severely with its battery (remember: they wanted it thin!).</p><p>The phone features a 3,900 mAh battery with 25W wired charging. If you're looking at the Galaxy S25 Ultra or even the Plus, there's a strong argument <em>against </em>the phone in terms of battery life. Nevertheless, if you overlook the compromises, perhaps you've got yourself a new phone.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a95753e5-8a75-40fa-bb46-faecbc2578bc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qR9jhpW8ExE78Mxtp6TGf.jpg' alt="Official render of the Galaxy S25 Edge"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Thin, Powerful Edge</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge bridges the gap between Samsung's powerful flagship phones in a thinner form factor.

We especially love the inclusion of a stylus at a mid-range price point,  the 120Hz AMOLED screen which measures 6.7 inches, and the long-lasting and fast-charging battery. Users can pretty easily get over a day or more of battery life, and the 68W charging speeds are unheard of within this phone's typical price range.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus also has an IP68 ingress protection rating, Android 15 with two years of OS upgrades, a high-res selfie camera, and a handful of useful AI features. It also feels satisfying to hold, with a durable build and a luxurious vegan-leather backing, so much so that it almost makes you forget it's normally a $400 phone.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus already earned a spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a> released this year, but thanks to this deal from AT&T, it's become an absolute steal.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It is a mighty successor to the Phone 2 and is also promised to be the most powerful flagship that the company has ever made. A new leak, on the other hand, reveals some specs and pricing of the handset alongside a brand-new product altogether.</p><p>The leak comes from prominent tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rquandt.bsky.social/post/3lqhagruvg22v">Roland Quandt on BlueSky</a>, wherein he has shared that the upcoming Phone 3 next month will be featuring in white and black colorways next to 12GB+256GB and 16GB+512GB storage configurations. Also, the pricing is believed to be starting at €850.</p><p>That said, showing up on the Android Show I/O edition, CEO Carl Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-summer-price-confirmed">confirmed</a> that the Phone 3 is on the way this summer and will cost "somewhere around" £800.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tSRJTR9jhzEwzXDLSVJJD5" name="Nothing-Phone-3-leak" alt="Nothing Phone 3 specs leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tSRJTR9jhzEwzXDLSVJJD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roland Quandt on Bluesky)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tipped pricing is significantly larger than the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> when it launched in 2023. It is still understandable as the Phone 3 is touted to be a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a> from Nothing, unlike the predecessor that targeted the higher mid-range Android phone market.</p><p>Quandt further adds an interesting detail about a new Nothing product, their new pair of headphones allegedly dubbed Nothing Headphone 1. Up until now, Nothing has designed and produced earbuds since the company’s inception, but just last month, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-is-talking-big-for-its-debut-over-ear-headphones-landing-this-summer">teased</a> these headphones in a YouTube video where the design team broke down what they’re after, though they’re still keeping the name a mystery.</p><p>The tipster has also shared the expected pricing of the Headphone, which should be starting at somewhere around €300, and it is also tipped to be coming in black and white color options.</p><p>The details of the upcoming products from Nothing are still scarce. Yet, they appear to be targeting the flagship space, and the signature Nothing design language is also expected. Besides, Nothing was also seen dropping hints about the upcoming Phone 3 as it is believed to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1928058744698482832">dropping the popular Glyph interface</a> this time around in favor of a dotted matrix interface, which the latest teaser from the company indicates to some extent.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone (3).

Now, we’re getting a clearer picture as that fresh look slowly starts landing in some users’ Gmail.</p><p>Material 3 Expressive adds some serious flair with responsive animations that make your phone feel way more fluid. Dismissing a notification now comes with this neat little peel-away motion and a matching haptic nudge.</p><p>Gmail’s latest update (2025.05.11) seems to have synced up with Google quietly pulling the trigger on a server-side change, setting the stage for its Material 3 Expressive revamp. Over on Telegram, SparkRadar caught the visual shake-up in action and shared some snaps of the fresh new look (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gmail-material-3-expressive-better-look-3563125/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>At present, Gmail’s look leans on a bold primary color for most of the main screen. That said, areas like the Search bar, bottom nav, and Compose button stand out with their own accent.</p><p>But with the Material 3 Expressive update, the whole layout gets a makeover. The message list now sits on its own raised card with soft, rounded corners and a lighter backdrop, giving it more depth and focus.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.26%;"><img id="armxpf8u8Ewa95v9UmxLvj" name="Gmail-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive update for Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/armxpf8u8Ewa95v9UmxLvj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.26%;"><img id="cUozbRKTYH2gEwTKBJcEpj" name="Gmail-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive update for Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUozbRKTYH2gEwTKBJcEpj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.26%;"><img id="wPTVUg8PCBAzXTThnf6Dnj" name="Gmail-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive update for Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wPTVUg8PCBAzXTThnf6Dnj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="color-explosion-2">Color explosion</h2><p>The Compose button has also had a glow-up.

Thanks to the new card-style layout, there’s way more room to play with tones and shades, making everything feel more layered and visually dynamic.</p><p>On one Gmail account, the account switcher has popped out of the search bar. Other screenshots still show it tucked inside the search bar, which makes sense since server-side rollouts like this often hit accounts individually and not all at once.</p><p>You can spot the card-style UI making another appearance on the email view screen.</p><h2 id="pill-shaped-swipes-2">Pill-shaped swipes</h2><p>Also, true to Google’s earlier teasers, Gmail’s Material 3 Expressive update brings in a new pill-shaped button animation that pops up when you swipe around.</p><p>Like mentioned before, these design tweaks are rolling out slowly through server-side switches. We’re still waiting to see how the rest of Material 3 Expressive shapes up across the rest of Google’s apps and tools.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google rolled out the update to make it easier to skim long threads at a glance.</p><p>Starting this week, if you’re using Gmail on Android or iOS, you’ll notice Gemini stepping in with quick summaries right at the top of your emails, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/05/gemini-summary-cards-gmail-app.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> says. It kicks in when your inbox starts looking like a novel, so you can catch the gist without scrolling forever.</p><p>Not every email is getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> treatment, so things like promos or receipts are off the table.

Back then, you had to tap “Summarize this email” to get a quick recap. That summary now shows up on its own right at the top when you open a thread.</p><p>These summaries might actually come in clutch, especially with long or messy email threads. Google says they’ll only show up when Gemini thinks they’re worth it, but if they start feeling more like clutter than help, it could get old fast. If that’s the case, you can turn them off—just know you’ll have to disable Gemini completely in Gmail to make that happen.</p><p>If you’re using Gmail through a school or company account, your admin is the one who decides whether these smart features are on or off. Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10095404" target="_blank">support page</a> says they’re turned off by default in places like Europe and Japan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And in the U.S., it's getting even better as the company is finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/samsung-wallet/tap-to-transfer/">rolling out</a> the new Tap to Transfer feature.</p><p>The new feature's aim is to make peer-to-peer (P2P) payments “quick and convenient” in the U.S. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introduces-new-tap-to-transfer-feature-for-samsung-wallet/">company announced</a> the feature early this month, the feature is now broadly rolling out this week.</p><p>Samsung has collaborated with Visa and Mastercard, with which users will be able to use a debit card that is already stored in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/what-is-samsung-digital-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a> to send money to friends and family — straight into their bank accounts. It works by the NFC tech utilized by Samsung Wallet that swiftly connects to the recipient’s debit card stored in their respective digital wallets — be it Samsung Wallet, Google Wallet, and even Apple Wallet for that matter.</p><p>Additionally, the new Tap to Transfer feature also works with recipients who have their physical debit card, which supports tap-to-pay capabilities — as it will have a connecting chip, which can be used by Samsung Wallet similar to what users pay at a retail store.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.50%;"><img id="QFunmZmWthQvnjw433ibmB" name="Samsung-Wallet-Tap-to-Transfer-feature" alt="Samsung Wallet Tap to Transfer feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QFunmZmWthQvnjw433ibmB.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="594" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another important thing to remember is that Samsung Wallet wouldn’t charge any fees for the Tap to Transfer feature. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/samsung-wallet/tap-to-transfer/#:~:text=Yes%2C%20a%201.75%25%20fee%20(minimum%20of%240.25%20cents)%20is%20applied%20to%20each%20transaction.%20The%20fee%20only%20applies%20to%20the%20sender.">FAQ page on the website</a>, however, mentions that “a 1.75% fee (minimum of $0.25) is applied to each transaction. The fee only applies to the sender.”</p><p>Other than the new Tap to Transfer, Samsung Wallet is the go-to application for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cheapest-samsung-phones-you-can-buy-today">Galaxy phone</a> users as they can store essential things like driver’s license, credit cards, passes, gym membership cards, loyalty and boarding passes, and gift cards, and more. Some college students can even store their student ID cards as well.</p><p>It is encouraging to see Samsung bringing interesting features to its Wallet app as users won’t have to rely on third-party apps for money transfer at least in the U.S. for now, and we hope the feature expands to even more countries soon.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Native Union got an early start thanks to the Voyage, a foldable charging mat that allows you to charge a phone and the Apple Watch together. The design makes the Voyage inherently portable, and the ability to charge two products makes it a decent choice for use on the road.</p><p>I've tested the Voyage for the better part of six months now, and having used it while traveling, I can attest to its charging potential and durability. Native Union may be a new entrant, but it clearly knows what it's doing, and the Voyage combines good build quality with 15W Qi 2 charging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="c6vLNTAHMMD9te5AaQbAmR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c6vLNTAHMMD9te5AaQbAmR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4995" height="2814" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I looked at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/satechi-onthego-3-in-1-is-the-best-qi-2-travel-charger">Satechi's OntheGo collection</a>, and what's evident is that these two products are nearly identical. The Voyage made its debut a year before the OntheGo collection, and Native Union alleges that Satechi stole its designs. I used enough charging accessories to know that brands often end up using the same manufacturer, and we'll have to wait and see if Native Union gets anywhere with its infringement claim.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WpmLpL3jnScrcXAubZqRfR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpmLpL3jnScrcXAubZqRfR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4960" height="2794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming back to the Voyage, it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Native-Union-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger/dp/B0DJCS5Q2N">available for $99 on Amazon</a>, and it is sold in two options — Sandstone and Black. The only limitation is that it doesn't include a GaN charger in the box, so you will need to plug it into a PD charger that delivers at least 27W of power.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5099px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Y7hiJdrsAD6bqEoH6nQRaR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y7hiJdrsAD6bqEoH6nQRaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5099" height="2872" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Voyage has rugged build quality, and the Sandstone color looks elegant.

It goes up to the standard 15W over Qi 2, and you can just as easily charge accessories on the charging mat. With standard Qi devices, you get 7.5W of power — just like any other mat.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="c6vLNTAHMMD9te5AaQbAmR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c6vLNTAHMMD9te5AaQbAmR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4995" height="2814" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's interesting is the puck that's integrated into the second mat; this allows you to easily charge smartwatches, and I used it extensively with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch Series 10</a>. It has an angled design that lets you raise the puck, and it does a great job. Another bonus is that you can use the charger on the side, and this will unlock StandBy mode when an iPhone is charging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4911px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="EbhkNX3dPsLFxYT5Mqh7iR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EbhkNX3dPsLFxYT5Mqh7iR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4911" height="2766" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Voyage folds down when not in use, and the magnets on either mat are strong — I didn't see any issues while charging a dozen or so phones and accessories in the last six months. The charger has a USB-C port on the side that lets you connect the cable, and given the cost, I would have liked a bundled 27W charger.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gSdj4ZodDD6XeY552CYykR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gSdj4ZodDD6XeY552CYykR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5134" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Build quality is among the best of any charger I used yet; Native Union did a great job with the selection of materials, and the Voyage is clearly built to last. The charger goes up to 18W with just the iPhone in use, so it makes sense to use at least a 27W wall plug if you need to charge your smartwatch along with a phone. I paired the Voyage with UGREEN's 160W Nexode Pro, and I didn't see any issues whatsoever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="J8739iAX3QDFoXQM73WgtR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J8739iAX3QDFoXQM73WgtR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Voyage is a good choice if you need a Qi 2 travel charger that's easy to take anywhere.

I only ran 23 miles after averaging 60 my first four months. Several work trips like I/O wore me out, but I have to be honest: The biggest issues are motivation and weather. It's getting hotter in California, and I'm months out from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/youve-quit-your-new-years-resolutions-already-heres-how-to-get-back-on-track">New Year's resolutions</a>. I need a training reboot.</p><p>I suspect many of you are the same. That's why June is the right month to retool our goals, with wearable tech to help.</p><p>The people who organized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://run.outsideonline.com/news/global-running-day/">Global Running Day</a> recognized that people need a training reboot in the summer. They encourage people of all fitness levels to run, jog, or fast-walk a few miles on the first Wednesday of June every year.</p><p>It's a lovely concept, and I encourage people to join the fun with their local running org or shop. Many fitness watches and apps like Garmin, Apple, and Strava will reward you with digital swag. But this is just one day a year, and not everyone loves running like I do.</p><p>So I worked on a more comprehensive three-month plan to survive the summer heat and come out of the season in better shape than when I started, using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> and other tools to keep me accountable. Here's how I recommend you do the same.</p><h2 id="june-focus-on-steps-before-everything-else-2">June: Focus on steps before everything else</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qiyo4WfeEBRQGJxhhJczpj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-vs-Garmin-Fenix-8-steps" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 (left) and Garmin Fenix 8 (right), both showing their respective step counts of 11,442 and 11,747." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qiyo4WfeEBRQGJxhhJczpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even though the 10,000 steps a day rule started off as a marketing gimmick, I truly got much healthier when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walked over 10,000 steps every day for a month</a>. The exact number is arbitrary; the important part is prioritizing consistency more than intensity.</p><p>Why? Because there's plenty of valid reasons to skip a hard workout after a workday: Tiredness, lateness, or responsibilities like cooking dinner will add up until you've spent a whole week slacking. But the only reason to skip a walk is lethargy. You can walk an hour whether it's blazing hot or at night by streetlight, even if you're worn out.</p><p>Plus, if you start doing a summer activity like golfing, pickleball, or softball, you'll naturally get steps even if you're not tracking a specific "activity" like a run or hike. Your smartwatch will keep you honest on how much you've <em>actually</em> moved and if you've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/make-sure-your-smartwatch-calorie-burn-is-accurate-with-this-scientific-calculator">burned enough calories</a> to earn that post-match beer or dessert.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nscnS29GJni7WyKUPAeLU3" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-walking-streak-2.jpeg" alt="A 31-day walk streak graph on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nscnS29GJni7WyKUPAeLU3.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most smartwatches have a widget or Tile showing whether you've hit your steps goal. My Garmin watch gives me badges for hitting 30 miles of walking or 300,000 steps per month, while a Galaxy or Apple Watch will praise you for closing your daily rings. It's a useful way to motivate yourself.</p><p>If you don't do anything else this June, take advantage of the late sundowns and pledge to walk for at least 8,000 steps a day.</p><p>Buy an epic fantasy audiobook or download a podcast that'll keep your mind occupied for dozens of hours, or else use the time to call family. Planned multitasking makes it feel less like wasted time, and you'll end up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">losing weight in the long run</a> simply by staying agile.</p><h2 id="june-to-july-stay-accountable-with-tech-and-people-not-just-money-2">June to July: Stay accountable with tech and people, not just money</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cZbJQ7pnaQLkWeZWYjCEZX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-daily-suggested-workout" alt="A daily suggested workout for an anerobic run on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZbJQ7pnaQLkWeZWYjCEZX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Several watches and apps have great self-guided training tools I'd recommend. Garmin Coach and daily suggested workouts tailor runs, walks, or strength training to your ability level. A Pixel Watch will give you a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">target cardio load</a> and daily run suggestions like Tempo or intervals. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/">TrainingPeaks</a> has well-regarded paid training plans, while brands like COROS have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.coros.com/training">free training calendars</a>.</p><p>All of them share one key problem, though: Only you can keep yourself accountable and motivated, and you wouldn't be reading this if motivation weren't a challenge! Trust me, I get it.</p><p>People use paid incentives like gym memberships to pressure themselves to work out, so they're not "wasting money." But negative motivation only goes so far before shame takes over. You can always tell yourself you'll "go tomorrow" repeatedly when, again, only you are holding yourself accountable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aEoDnzoLj7iS7ZzwE7FyCR" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-team-sports" alt="A Garmin Forerunner 970 sitting atop a pink soccer ball on pavement, with a kid's baseball bat next to it leaned against a bush." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aEoDnzoLj7iS7ZzwE7FyCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's what makes summer a great time for adults to reboot their goals. Unlike students who have sports clubs all year <em>except</em> summer, adults can typically find community activities this time of year for people looking to rekindle their love of sport and make connections.</p><p>Join a flag football league, running club, pickleball class, or any other team or community sport. You're much less likely to flake out without a legitimate excuse because others expect you. It's more fun than a solitary workout, so it feels less like work.</p><p>Some of these activities will continue into fall, but summer is usually when sports and training orgs recruit new members. So take the time this weekend to Google your best nearby options and get signed up for <em>something</em> fun before end of June. You'll still have to work out properly other days of the week, but these community days will keep you limber and motivated.</p><h2 id="july-go-all-in-on-sleep-tracking-2">July: Go all-in on sleep tracking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3850px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="PmC2GCnBzhjJroVcCkEcXB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-03" alt="Sleep data on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PmC2GCnBzhjJroVcCkEcXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3850" height="2166" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to studies cited by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230315-how-the-seasons-change-our-sleep">BBC</a>, people get (on average) an hour less sleep in June than in December, and 30 minutes less REM sleep. Early sunlight wakes you, the long days keep you out and active for longer, social drinking worsens your sleep quality, and warmer temperatures make it hard for your body temp to drop the 2–3º necessary for unimpeded sleep.</p><p>You'll hopefully spend June getting steps and joining team sports that tire you out for better sleep.

My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> notes stats like HR drop, skin temperature, time in sleep stages, restlessness, and duration.</p><p>Of course, many fitness smartwatches track the same stats, if you'd rather not buy two separate devices. What's important is using tools like Garmin Body Battery, Fitbit Daily Readiness, Samsung Energy Score, and so on to keep yourself accountable.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-clinical-sleep-lead-has-cool-ideas-for-future-of-smartwatch-sleep-tracking">interviewed Google's clinical sleep lead</a> earlier this year, and he warned that people are "terrible estimators" of their own tiredness and can function with a "severe amount of sleep impairment that you're not even fully cognizant of."

href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-and-display">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> feels like a breath of fresh air. The standard Galaxy S25 sports a 6.2-inch AMOLED display, which is the smallest of the major Android flagships. That's either a pro or a con, depending on whether you prefer a more compact form factor. This model is also the cheapest of the bunch, starting at just $800 and frequently available for much less with post-launch discounts.</p><p>Don't be fooled, however — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-arent-the-same">the Galaxy S25 isn't like the rest of Samsung's flagship lineup</a>. The base model has shortcomings compared to the pack, like 128GB storage, no support for UWB, and a lower-resolution display without ProScaler AI. Although other AI features, like Now Brief, are available on the base Galaxy S25, the above omissions are notable oversights.</p><p>The cameras also haven't been updated since 2022, and leave a lot to be desired.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-3" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, for the good.

The AMOLED 2X display supports variable refresh rates up to 120Hz, plus loads of other specs like HDR10+ and 2,600 nits of peak brightness. The FHD+ display (1080 x 2340) is still gorgeous to use and plenty bright.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-11" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a 4,000mAh battery and support for slow 25W wired charging, the Galaxy S25 isn't outstanding for battery life. However, it's better than the Galaxy S25 Edge (for whatever that's worth) and decent overall. You can get a full day of charge with moderate usage, easily.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is for the smartphone user who just wants the basics in a compact form factor and at a fairly affordable price. There's enough power here to make this phone feel like a bona-fide flagship without going overboard.

It's not very original, with the same general design and few hardware upgrades compared to its predecessor. Like the base Galaxy S25, the Galaxy S25 Plus retains the same camera hardware as the Galaxy S22 series. Still, at $999 and packing a 6.7-inch display, the Galaxy S25 Plus tends to hit the right price and size for a lot of people.</p><p>It builds upon the building blocks of the Galaxy S25, elevating them to provide a more comprehensive experience. The device features a larger battery with a 4,900mAh capacity, and the larger size enables a 45W wired charging speed. That addresses a common gripe with the base model, and it's not the only one.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus also starts at 256GB of storage with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care" target="_blank">UFS 4.0</a> support, a UWB chip for precise location finding, and a larger (and improved) QHD+ display with ProScaler AI.

However, it tries to justify that starting price with loads of features, including a massive 6.9-inch display, an inbuilt S Pen, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">robust camera system</a>.</p><p>It's the only Galaxy S25 model to receive a camera upgrade this year, although the primary 200MP camera sensor is unchanged. Instead, the ultrawide camera is now using a 50MP sensor, up from 12MP. You also get a 10MP, 3x telephoto lens and a 50MP, 5x telephoto lens. In other words, the Galaxy S25 Ultra offers the best camera system available on a Samsung phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's for power users first and foremost, with a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, 12GB of RAM, and a 5,000mAh battery capacity.

Mixed in with articles about aquarium heaters, the effect of Saharan dust on Florida's ecosystem, and doing your own front-end alignment (don't, trust me), I recently saw that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/tsa-issues-warning-smartphones-devices-172509328.html" target="_blank">TSA has issued another warning about juice jacking at the airport</a>.</p><p>Juice jacking is even dirtier than it sounds. It's when someone plants a computer inside a USB charging station that can try to send <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tech-talk-more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-malware">malware</a> to the things you plug in to charge. We've all seen those charging kiosks, and there's plenty of room to sneak a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> inside to redistribute software you<em> really</em> don't want to tangle with.</p><p>The TSA recommends that you never plug a smart device directly into one of those kiosks. I don't know if they have new intel they aren't sharing or they just wanted to remind us about it, but with that warning in mind, let's talk about how you should charge your stuff on the go.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3979px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-01" alt="Charging the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3979" height="2238" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a couple of ways to make sure you aren't presenting a direct path for malware to get to your phone or laptop through the USB port. One is to carry around a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cukteks-40000mah-battery-pack">battery pack</a> and plug it into the public USB charger, then plug your phone (or whatever) into the battery. Both will charge at the same time.</p><p>Another way is with a power-only cable. A USB cable needs to have two wires to charge your phone, but usually has a few extra wires to carry data back and forth to other things you might want to plug in, like headphones or a thumb drive. You don't need those data wires to charge your phone.</p><p>You can buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Charge-Only-Power-Only-Protector-USBSCHAC1M/dp/B09479KTC9/" target="_blank">a power-only USB cable</a> from anywhere that sells electronics, like Amazon. You can also buy little adapters that only pass through power; plug them on the end of your cable, and it effectively cuts off all the wires except for the ones you need for power transfer. Either is a good choice.</p><p>Use your "regular" cable when you use your own charger — the thingy you plug into the wall. Any other time, use the one that only provides power.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1548px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aR5umpaonXg2VoBZQj4EoW" name="battery-packs-169.jpg" alt="Battery packs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aR5umpaonXg2VoBZQj4EoW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1548" height="871" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The third option, and the one I like, is to use a cable with a switch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OSOM-Privacy-Cable-Blocker-Prevent/dp/B0C41BW4N8/" target="_blank">OSOM Privacy Cable</a>. I picked up a couple of these a while back, and anytime I might need to use a public charging kiosk at a train station or airport, I use one.</p><p>It's simple, and if you're handy, you could make one yourself. It has a tiny switch at the end that connects the data wires when it's in one position and disconnects them in the other. It's not really any better way to protect yourself than using a battery pack or a power-only cable, but to me, it's more convenient than carrying around stuff I don't need.</p><p>What's important is that you use one of these methods. I don't think this happens too often, but I have seen a "compromised" USB kiosk at Oakland International Airport. I know it was, as they were there removing it because it had a small computer inside that was spreading malware. It was kind of cool seeing inside, but not very cool thinking it might have contaminated someone else's belongings. People can be bad.</p><p>We can't tell you what to think or what to do. We can tell you how easy it is to protect yourself from things like this, though. Trust me, spending $20 on cables is way cheaper than getting bitten by malware in the long run.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And it's a good change — even if you never plan to fix something like a pair of headphones yourself, this will let a qualified technician do it at half the cost. That's money saved you could spend on other stuff like groceries or weed.</p><p>You might think that fixing an old pair of headphones is nothing new, but we're talking about Bluetooth technology here. You know, with little circuit boards and batteries and ribbon cables. That's a lot different from your old headset held together with electrical tape and speaker wire. Yeah, I have those, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RTvQZUpM864zgAJRcgyg8m" name="fairphone-fairbuds-black-colorway-parts-hero.jpg" alt="The Fairphone Fairbuds in black with replaceable parts scattered about." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RTvQZUpM864zgAJRcgyg8m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even more encouraging is seeing earbuds becoming repairable.

They always felt like enthusiast watches for runners or outdoorsy types, neither of which I am. Additionally, the buttons and confusing UI made them difficult to pick up. However, the Garmin Vivoactive 6 seems to be a remedy to this, offering a fairly affordable alternative with a simple design and a more user-friendly UI.</p><p>The Vivoactive 6 feels like the perfect entryway into the world of Garmin watches, especially if you’re not really a runner. You may not get all the latest and greatest features or specs, as anyone looking for those will have to spend significantly more on a watch.

It's on the smaller side, which may not suit you if you have larger wrists, but the plus side is that it's neither thick nor heavy. In fact, the watch is very light and comfortable to wear. This is great not only in everyday use, but also when wearing it to bed, as I hardly notice it's on, unlike other smartwatches.</p><p>It's fairly tough, too, although probably not as sturdy as pricier models. You still get solid water protection with 5 ATM, meaning the watch can be submerged up to 50 meters deep, which should appeal to casual swimmers. Gorilla Glass 3 protection should also help keep the display intact, while the aluminum bezel and fiber-reinforced polymer case give the watch a soft feel.</p><p>The OLED display is very vibrant and fairly easy to maneuver, despite the rather large bezels. It's incredibly responsive and bright enough to use outdoors. At just 1.2 inches, I wish the display were larger, but it still serves its purpose.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="bYbMgLLaxKMxfPwAQYTGiB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-06" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 on a concrete surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bYbMgLLaxKMxfPwAQYTGiB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing I noticed immediately after setting up the Vivoactive 6 is that the UI is a significant improvement over the Venu 3, which is the only other Garmin watch I've used. It's not perfect, but menus feel more logical, and other UI changes make more sense, such as accessing notifications by swiping down from the home screen and then Glance shortcuts by swiping up. Quick settings are accessible by swiping down, or you can press and hold the main power button. Settings can also be accessed by holding the back button.</p><p>I think part of what makes this easier to navigate, aside from the revamped software, is that you only have two hardware buttons. As I found having a third button on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> to be confusing, I appreciate the simplicity.</p><p>Overall, the UI feels significantly more inviting for casual fitness enthusiasts and anyone looking to purchase their first Garmin watch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Myc8F9E9a9ayZqH426eeZB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-08" alt="Music controls on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Myc8F9E9a9ayZqH426eeZB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4068" height="2288" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life is quite solid on the Vivoactive 6. Garmin claims you can get up to 11 days of battery life per charge, which I don't doubt. I consistently get a full week of battery life, with one or two workouts tracked per day and the display set to gesture activation. You'd get less battery with the always-on display activated, but I find the gesture option to be perfectly adequate.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-vivoactive-6-fitness"><span>Garmin Vivoactive 6: Fitness</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="warDH6o9Dgr6nmLNSBpWKC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-14" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6, Venu 3, Pixel Watch 3, and Oura Ring 4 next to dumbbells" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/warDH6o9Dgr6nmLNSBpWKC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-venu-3"><strong>Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Venu 3</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately"><strong>Garmin Connect Plus hands-on</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-io-2025-health-connect-support-details"><strong>Garmin is getting Health Connect support</strong></a></p></div></div><p>The Vivoactive 6 doesn't come with Garmin's latest Elevate sensor technology, meaning you won't get the improved accuracy found on models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-and-570-revealed-all-key-upgrades">Forerunner 970</a> or even the Venu 3.

It also comes with suggested workouts, although you won't get much more than suggested walks. It's ideal for casual fitness enthusiasts and serves as a good way to encourage users to get up and move throughout the day.</p><p>I wish the suggested workouts were a bit more varied, especially for someone like me who actively engages in HIIT, weightlifting, and power yoga six days a week. That said, it's clear that this watch is more focused on encouraging users to be active than on pushing them, which, again, would be more characteristic of a Forerunner.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PXefbBe2tNuAhWvQJ2oNT3" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-18" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 daily workout suggestion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXefbBe2tNuAhWvQJ2oNT3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The watch features built-in GPS and supports various navigational systems, which are pretty accurate and handy for tracking your route on runs or hikes. Keep in mind that you don't get an altimeter, which is a downside if you enjoy the outdoors and hiking. You also can't download maps to the watch, which may be a downside for some.</p><p>You do, however, have access to workout videos directly on the watch, which is helpful when following the pre-made workouts created in Garmin Connect. You can also curate your own workout within the app, although this feels like a very time-consuming and tedious task, and I would quit halfway through.</p><p>If you're a weightlifter like me, you'll likely be pleased with the workout tracking. It can automatically detect reps and rest between sets. It's not perfect, but it's quite handy and more accurate than Galaxy smartwatches in my experience, and significantly more accurate than you'll get with a Pixel Watch.</p><p>Otherwise, the watch comes with a variety of workout modes, which should please most users.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4109px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-12" alt="A workout animation on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4109" height="2311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sleep tracking has been fairly accurate, even when compared to my Oura Ring 4.

There's also no ECG, but you'll get just about every other health tracking feature that one should expect on a smartwatch.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-vivoactive-6-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Garmin Vivoactive 6: What I don't like</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="5PsC2pTAYxCyX8J9KQXDLC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-10" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5PsC2pTAYxCyX8J9KQXDLC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The UI on the Vivoactive 3 is much improved, but it still comes with some quirks that I feel are typical for Garmin. Notifications can often take up the entire screen, which can be quite annoying when you're actually trying to do something on the watch. Furthermore, the vibration intensity can't be altered, so you'll get a pretty jarring buzz unless you turn the vibration off.</p><p>Speaking of vibrations, the watch features a Smart Alarm that utilizes sleep tracking to wake you up at the optimal time, so you feel less groggy. It sounds great in theory, but I've found this feature pretty useless or annoying. Oftentimes, I wake up ahead of my set alarm, so the Vivoactive ends up just being late to the party when the smart alarm finally goes off. It also only has a 30-minute window, which doesn't seem like enough time to take advantage of a feature like this, especially if your sleep schedule is as erratic as mine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eTYwPtjmSaJ9VV5GsTqVMB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-17" alt="Move Break alert on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eTYwPtjmSaJ9VV5GsTqVMB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3814" height="2145" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Vivo<em>active</em> also has Move Break alerts to remind you to get up and move, which makes sense.

That's whether you're on the watch or in the app. Using the Garmin Connect app can be overwhelming, and I often had to refer to Android Central senior editor and wearables expert Michael Hicks to figure out how to do things on the watch or in the app.</p><p>The smartwatch UI is a significant step in the right direction, but I feel that the app could use some improvement.</p><p>Bonus: I briefly used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect Plus subscription</a> while testing the Vivoactive 6, but honestly did not find it useful enough to warrant sticking with it.

One UI 8 brings all of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a>'s perks to the Galaxy S25 for the first time, and beta-enrolled users try out new features before they're publicly released.</p><p>To start, Samsung's AI Select tool is now faster than ever.

One UI 8 also takes multitasking to the next level, with this 90:10 feature, which lets you resize a split window down to 10% of its normal size, helping users switch between two apps with a single tap without feeling like the app is crammed when the screen is split.</p><p>Samsung's Weather app, Reminder, Health, and Auracast also get major glow-ups with this new update. Furthermore, Samsung also confirmed that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">next-gen foldables phones</a> will launch later this year with a stable version of One UI 8.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><hr><h2 id="galaxy-watch-8-series-allegedly-clears-another-certification-2">Galaxy Watch 8 series allegedly clears another certification</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.67%;"><img id="QVzVDQzpLvuF7L8BAZt7Qg" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-and-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-CMIIT-certified" alt="Galaxy watch 8 and galaxy watch 8 classic leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QVzVDQzpLvuF7L8BAZt7Qg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="680" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XpertPick)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/alleged-galaxy-watch-8-series-clears-another-certification-new-leak-claims"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>We might be just mere<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york"> weeks away from the next Unpacked event</a>, and it has been raining leaks.</p><p>The most recent one comes from folks at Xpert Pick who claim to have spotted both watches from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8 series </a>pass through the CMIIT certification (Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology).</p><p>As we can see in the screenshot, both certificates mention model numbers attached to the alleged upcoming wearables, SM-L3350 and SM-L5050, respectively. Previous leaks have indicated that these model numbers seem to be associated with the Galaxy Watch 8 (LTE) and the Watch 8 Classic (LTE).</p><p>The certification notes within the screenshot describe both these devices to have eSIM technology with an independent eUICC chip, which will allow users to connect to cellular networks without the phone, which is what the previous leaks have been indicating as well.</p><hr><h2 id="nothing-is-giving-up-its-glyph-lights-2">Nothing is giving up its Glyph lights</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N" name="nothing-phone-2a-camera-hump-02.jpg" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone (2a) with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-is-giving-up-the-one-thing-that-sets-its-phones-apart"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Nothing has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-emoji-teasers-impending-launch">dropping several hints on X</a> about its upcoming flagship Nothing Phone 3. In its most recent post, it suggested that its next flagship will not have the signature Glyph Light interface on the rear panel, which has been featured on previous models.</p><p>In an almost straightforward post, the company announced the end of the Glyph Interface in an X video, captioned "we killed the Glyph Interface," where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-hands-on-preview-impressions">Phone 1</a>'s lights dramatically blink out to black.</p><p>This could potentially mean that its next flagship device, Nothing Phone 3 may not show up with those rear light, a feature that drew several people to buy the Nothing phones in the first place.</p><p>That said, if the company takes away the one thing that sets it apart, what would its rear panel actually look like? Some speculate that the phone could come with a dot-matrix display on the back. The teasers of Phone 3 had videos with the same dot-matrix pattern, showing a pixelated "3" or Pac-Man-style animations with dots, majorly hinting at a change in visual design.</p><hr><h2 id="oneplus-snuck-in-two-new-phones-on-the-ace-5-series-2">OnePlus snuck in two new phones on the Ace 5 series</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4VvBrdBd4AwWSb6jqNSjzM" name="OnePlus- Ace-5-Racing-series" alt="OnePlus adds two new phones to Ace 5 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4VvBrdBd4AwWSb6jqNSjzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: GSM Arena)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-quietly-launched-two-new-ace-5-series-phones-and-they-look-spectacular"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>OnePlus has just launched two new phones: the OnePlus Ace 5 Ultra Edition and the Ace 5 Racing Edition.</p><p>Designed with gaming enthusiasts in mind, these phones combine sleek design, powerful hardware, and impressive battery life for an "ultimate gaming experience."

Measuring 5.8mm thick (excluding the camera bump), it’s currently the thinnest flagship phone, although it is still much thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a>, which is 4.21mm thin when unfolded. For comparison, the Edge is between 1.4mm and 2.4mm thinner than the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup.</p><p>It’s not just about the thickness, as arguably the more impactful feature is the weight. At 163 grams, it’s just one gram heavier than the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, but features the larger display of the Galaxy S25 Plus and the primary camera of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> weighs 27 grams more, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is a whopping 55 grams more, or over a third of the total weight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-vs-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-thickness-1" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Galaxy S25 Ultra (left) and Galaxy S25 Edge (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These numbers may seem inconsequential, but they are core to the Galaxy S25 Edge offering. It combines the best features of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> into a phone that’s thinner, lighter, and much more pocket-friendly.</p><p>Once you hold the Galaxy S25 Edge in your hands, the thin profile and light weight quickly assuaged many of my concerns around missing features, the smaller battery, or the lack of a telephoto lens. I didn’t realize that phone thickness was important to me until I used the Galaxy S25 Edge.</p><p>Beyond the design, you get a structure that Samsung has refined over the past few years. There’s a titanium build that feels extremely premium, and it’s paired with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. Despite some concerns about the thickness, especially considering other phones in history that have been thin and bent easily, the Galaxy S25 Edge has shown no signs of bending easily during daily usage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yRPgT7JZSbnDWsdgnDvG5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-16" alt="Left side mmWave antenna and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yRPgT7JZSbnDWsdgnDvG5Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-10" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-11" alt="Right side buttons and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fF77UXEr7SF8QynYJxn45Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-4" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fF77UXEr7SF8QynYJxn45Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The 6.7-inch display on the front is protected by Corning’s new Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, which is virtually identical to the Ceramic glass used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, but lacks the anti-glare finish.

When Samsung first revealed the battery capacity, I expected this to be my biggest challenge, but as it turns out, this is only partially true.</p><p>Like many phone makers, Samsung has been promising all-day battery life on its phones for many years, and most phones deliver with some charge remaining at the end of the day. The Galaxy S25 Edge also delivers all-day battery life, but it gets dangerously close to needing a recharge before the end of the day.</p><div><blockquote><p>Battery life isn't phenomenal, but it's also not as bad as you would expect.</p></blockquote></div><p>Everyone’s usage varies, so what does all-day battery life look like? Charging to full at 11 a.m. (having forgotten to charge it overnight), the Galaxy S25 Edge lasted a total of 28 hours on a full charge with just under seven hours of screen time and around seven percent battery remaining. It’s fairly representative of the maximum battery life you can expect, and that was with light gaming, a lot of streaming, web browsing, and some calls, with half the day on Wi-Fi and half without.</p><p>The battery life meets my expectations for moderate to heavy usage in a day, and should be sufficient for most users. However, it’s much harder to excuse the slower 25W charging, which takes around 80 minutes to charge the phone. Samsung opted against including the 45W charging from the S25 Plus, despite the S25 Edge costing more, which is harder to accept considering the price.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-cameras"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Cameras</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-3" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge camera sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>200MP primary camera from the S25 Ultra.</strong></li><li><strong>12MP ultrawide camera.</strong></li><li><strong>No telephoto lens, quality degrades after 2x.</strong></li></ul><hr><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge has two rear cameras.

the OIS is somewhat ineffective, and the camera is unable to compensate for the loss of detail. Instead, you get photos that have slight motion to them and lack the finesse of other cameras. You also need the larger pixel size to compensate for light in low-light conditions, so the 12MP photos tend to be the best overall.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

Unlike Samsung’s past Edge phones, such as the Galaxy S6 Edge and its waterfall display design, there are no exclusive software tricks on this phone. Rather, you get the same, great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, Galaxy AI, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> experience that you’ll find across the rest of the lineup.</p><p>That includes a smooth interface with bubble-like, rounded edges; a split notification center and quick settings similar to iOS; an app drawer that can finally be laid out vertically in alphabetical order; and greater consistency with other Android devices. I’ve been a fan of One UI for many years, but One UI 7 feels better than ever before.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-32" alt="All three colors for the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another great addition to the software is the deep partnership between Samsung and Google.

Everything else was likely to be extremely solid. Having spent time with the Galaxy S25 Edge, it delivers on two out of the three, but the camera falls short.</p><p>Yet, for some people, this could be the ideal phone.

The event is supposedly set to begin at 2:30pm at 38 Southwark Street, London. However, there's a catch — alleged invitees need to pass a test and enter a contest to be shortlisted.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zP94fsDoe3cLANjPXFjGYY" name="Pixel-superfans-launch-event" alt="Google announces content for pre-launch event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zP94fsDoe3cLANjPXFjGYY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google seems to have included a few questions at the end of their emails to gauge how much of a Superfan you actually are. The questions range from "What is your favorite Pixel feature and why?" to the types of offers that attract someone when purchasing a new Pixel. Those invited have until June 4 to complete the quiz and enter the contest; winners will be announced on June 11.</p><p>Additionally, the email also adds that attendees get exclusive hands-on time with the new Pixel phones, get treated to custom Pixel themed goodies and a change to be in a "one off interview and Q/A session with Googlers."</p><p>That said, this seems really early for Google to launch its next flagship devices and many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1kz9g7v/pixel_devices_being_announced_at_the_end_of_jine/x">speculate</a> that this could hint at an early launch. The tech giant usually launches its flagship phones in August, so a pre-launch event in June could mean that official teasers and announcements are right around the corner.</p><p>As of now, invites for the pre-launch event appears to be limited to London, and it remains uncertain whether Google will hold similar events in other cities as well.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After receiving a tip about it, the post states the feature is rolling out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> QPR1 Beta 1. Appearing in the settings, Google says Advanced Protection "helps defend against online attacks, harmful apps, insecure connections, and other threats."</p><p>The initial welcome page breaks things down into two options: a toggle for Advanced Protection and an "Account Protection" for your Google Account. However, the company has included a "device protection features" button, which divulges everything Advanced Protection offers.</p><p>The publication discovered that the security feature protects users in six different ways. The first, Device Safety, keeps your phone safe if it's taken away from you and "blocks USB transfers." For apps, the feature will "prevent" apps from harming/corrupting your phone's memory for malicious purposes.

This leads the publication to believe that Sony has completely moved away from manufacturing its Xperia phone in its own production facilities.</p><p>With this, it seems almost certain that Sony has opted to "outsource" the creation of its Xperia phone line to third-party companies. The publication mentions that Sony has done this before, just not with its flagship series. The Japanese OEM's mid-range devices have had their production outsourced for a while, but Sony has remained adamant (until now) to keep its Xperia close to heart.</p><p>Its research adds that not only has Sony removed all mentions of its smartphone devices from its official website, but sites from its overseas plants in Thailand and China have also dropped it.</p><p>While the future of Sony's Xperia line seems to fall on third-party sources, it's also reportedly looped in the Xperia 1 VII, per reports.</p><h2 id="the-latest-from-sony-2">The Latest from Sony</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yhohesFirrUMfuk5pPgpdg" name="sony-xperia-1-vii-01" alt="Sony Xperia 1 VII" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yhohesFirrUMfuk5pPgpdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sony's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony/sony-xperia-1-vii-goes-official-with-a-familiar-design-and-considerable-software-updates">Xperia 1 VII launched</a> earlier in May with a strong focus on its available camera selection. The phone features a triple camera array with a 52MP primary lens leading it off. This camera is joined by a 50MP secondary lens and a 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens. Sony continued to feature its Alpha-powered tech and ZEISS for the cameras, as it has done with its previous generation.</p><p>Sony's flagship phones rock Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with a 6.5-inch display with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>Another shining highlight for the Xperia 1 VII is Sony's software commitment. The company states the phone will receive four years of major OS upgrades and six years of security updates.</p><p>For now, the future of Sony's Xperia series seems relatively the same as before, barring the company continues development before leaning on third parties. However, the Japanese publication's report says there has been a rise in consumer concern about Sony's move. Some have questioned the future of the Xperia's quality, but only time will tell.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/thread/345608360/issue-fixed-repeated-pin-pattern-prompts-for-wear-os-payments" target="_blank">community post</a> Thursday, May 29, a Google employee confirmed the bug causing Wear OS devices to repeatedly ask for PIN/pattern authentication is fixed (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/30/google-wallet-wear-os-pin-fix/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Now, users can continue to make Wallet transactions without needing to authenticate their purchase every single time. After unlocking the smartwatch and keeping it strapped to your wrist, you can make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> contactless payments quickly and easily without entering your PIN or pattern.</p><p>The updated community post explains that some Wear OS users were "being asked to re-enter their PIN/password on their smartwatch during in-store payments." The company acknowledged the issue on May 20, and more than a week later, the patch is available.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3" name="add-card-to-google-wallet-pixel-watch.jpg" alt="Add new card to Google Wallet on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Initially, it was unclear whether this bug was a behavior change coinciding with an adjustment made to the way Google Wallet works on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android</a>. For smartphones, Google Wallet now needs to be unlocked with a passcode or biometrics for the app to be opened. While the emergence of the Wear OS bug seemed to line up with this tweak, it turned out to be a mistake after all.</p><p>Not all Wear OS users were affected by the problem, so if you haven't been dealing with repeated authentication prompts, you can continue using Google Wallet as normal. However, the issue seemed fairly widespread, as over 360 users reported having the same problem on the community post — and those are just the ones we know about.</p><p>To get the fix, make sure your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Google Wallet app</a> is updated to <strong>version 25.17</strong> on your Wear OS smartwatch. It's unclear if the patch is a server-side adjustment or if it requires an app update.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication has supposedly come across the model numbers for the batteries en route to the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. The standout here is that the Ultra model is rumored to see quite a battery increase.</p><p>The post states the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra's battery is labeled model number EB-BX936ABY, and could bring the first battery capacity upgrade for the Ultra line. Supposedly, the battery sports a rated capacity of 11,374mAh, which would be 500mAh more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a>. The publication suggests Samsung could stretch its advertised capacity to ~12,000mAh, but even that might be pushing it.</p><p>Elsewhere, details highlight the expected base Galaxy Tab S11 model, which could see an 8,160mAh battery.</p><h2 id="samsung-figures-out-its-galaxy-tab-2">Samsung figures out its Galaxy Tab</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-empty-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra - Empty Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">pretty early in the rumors</a> for Samsung's Galaxy Tab S11 series; however, it seems consumers are in for another shakeup. The Korean OEM is reportedly only interested in debuting a Galaxy Tab S11 and a Tab S11 Ultra, no Plus model.

This is MediaTek's flagship chip that launched in October in preparation to take on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>When these devices could launch is still anyone's guess.

This name might sound familiar, especially if you're a Pokémon GO fan. Niantic reiterates its recent sale of its games division to Scopely. In short, the company is starting with roughly $250 million in its back pocket. As such, Niantic Spatial is turning onto a different road, one that will lead it toward a "large geospatial model."</p><p>Niantic Spatial states it will seek to bridge the gap between the "physical and digital worlds" through this geospatial fusion.</p><p>If all goes well, Niantic states its new model will facilitate better understanding and interactions between people and machines to "improve how we live and work." This large geospatial model has reportedly been developed using "over 30 billion posed images from millions of locations around the world." Niantic states this should aid LLMs (large language models) with spatial reasoning.</p><p>Essentially, these models (in theory) will be able to see/understand where something is in the physical world, and its real-world application to the space around it.</p><p>Niantic says that the issue with today's AI is that it's restricted to understanding "text, code, and images" only. Its geospatial model aims to break that open by creating a new "map" that enables these machines to understand our world the way we do.</p><h2 id="a-spatial-future-2">A Spatial Future</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:594px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:101.01%;"><img id="3fM9UTZBoGYTeV6UyLQ62W" name="niantic-spatial-announcement" alt="Niantic Spatial foresees a future where the digital and physicals combine to better human life." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fM9UTZBoGYTeV6UyLQ62W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="594" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Niantic Spatial)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Niantic hopes to place its AI models in smaller devices like AR glasses; however, it also has set its sights on autonomous systems. The post also highlights the Niantic Spatial Platform, which consists of the Visual Positioning System, Gaussian Splatting (3D scanning/visualization), and developer SDKs. Niantic says it is working on deploying proof-of-concepts across various real-world areas.</p><p>Niantic's interest in AI isn't anything new, as its CEO, John Hanke, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/brilliant-labs-frame-smart-glasses-announcement">publicly backed a pair of smart glasses</a> from Brilliant Labs last year. Not only were these glasses light, but they could be outfitted with custom prescription lenses, too. Additionally, Brilliant Labs featured multimodal AI software for the device's front-facing spatial camera.</p><p>The company's AI, Noa, can hear and see the world around you.

It even told me that "it will be a single-page website," before rendering the page in a preview window for me to see.</p><p>After the site finished rendering, Gemini provided a brief explanation as to how it created the site, including the frameworks that it used.</p><h2 id="gemini-2-5-flash-preview-2">Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1439px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="hgcd2SCFxhgvX3oji6fLMZ" name="gemini-25-flash-preview-basic-prompt-2" alt="Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview results from basic prompt to create Android History website - error" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgcd2SCFxhgvX3oji6fLMZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1439" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Using the same prompt, I switched over to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-releases-gemini-2-5-flash-with-hybrid-reasoning-and-boasts-faster-speeds">Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview</a> in AI Studio and was provided with something a bit different. I fed Gemini the same prompt, and was taken to a completely different dashboard. However, it didn't take long for me to realize that this is essentially a coding studio, as the middle pane shows the layout of various files. Meanwhile, the pane on the right is where I watched the code being generated by Gemini.</p><p>A few minutes later, I came back to my computer after grabbing some coffee and was met with an error message in the preview window. I have no clue what it was trying to fetch or why, and thankfully, I didn't need to. In the Code Assistant panel, there's a little button that says "Auto-fix." So obviously, I clicked on it and let Gemini fix its own code.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1886px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="LRMQJhfHDgFhB46TnfdSPZ" name="gemini-25-flash-preview-basic-prompt-3" alt="Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview results from basic prompt to create Android History website" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LRMQJhfHDgFhB46TnfdSPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1886" height="1061" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not only did it figure out what was wrong, but it also provided an explanation, along with the necessary fixes, and just started updating the code itself.

These sets of features are believed to be going away in September.</p><p>Google further suggests its users to save their current call history and messages and export them to Meet and has offered a step-by-step process on the corresponding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/15226792?sjid=17473795407927261018-NC">support page</a>.</p><p>While some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/15226792?sjid=17473795407927261018-NC">legacy features are being removed</a>, some of them are upgraded in Google Meet in addition to a few more.

When all parties in the call are using the latest version of Meet with the update, they’ll see an in-app prompt explaining that they are now using the new calling experience. Otherwise, the call will default to the legacy calling experience. Once all users are using the updated Meet app, legacy calling will no longer be accessible.”</p><p>Users are recommended to stay on the latest version of the app and export the call history and video messages from the previous Legacy Duo app. As it is time to shift from legacy calls to new Meet calls.

However, the full details are currently unclear, since these code strings haven't materialized into actionable or viewable notifications just yet.</p><p>Either way, it seems to be a good sign that Google is working on building a proper sleep timer for Google TV. Previously, Android TV's implementation of the feature required OEMs to build their own user-interfaces for the handy tool. Soon, Google TV users may be able to use convenient sleep timers to make sure their nighttime binges don't continue after their eyes close.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Still, the chip that will power the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-usa-exynos-not-snapdragon/">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> in the U.S. is still unclear. Rumors and leaks have debated whether the flip-style foldable will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> or the Samsung Exynos 2500 for months. The conflicting reports seem to have only intensified as we slowly get closer to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7's expected release window.</p><p>A report from the Korean news outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025052792731" target="_blank">Hank Yung</a> earlier this week claimed that Samsung will use a mix of Snapdragon and Exynos chips in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 depending on the region. For example, the publication cited the Snapdragon 8 Elite as being planned for the U.S. and Canada. In that case, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-exynos-2500-chip-usage-rumored">Exynos 2500</a> could power the flip phone in most other regions.</p><p>Things got interesting when another report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-usa-exynos-not-snapdragon/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> on Thursday, May 29 claimed the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will indeed be powered by the Exynos 2500 in the U.S. Specifically, SamMobile writes that "Galaxy Z Flip 7 firmware for the U.S. makes it pretty clear that the processor inside the phone is the Exynos 2500."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4ApqkPpviaQcYgYmtvj6ce" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-02.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6  cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ApqkPpviaQcYgYmtvj6ce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this leaves the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7's processor up in the air. Aside from the above statement, SamMobile didn't provide any more details regarding the firmware evidence signaling the device will be powered by the Exynos 2500. Hank Yung similarly hasn't shared concrete evidence that the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip will power the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in the U.S., either.</p><p>The dueling reports regarding the Galaxy Z Flip 7's processor mean that we don't know which chip will power the phone in which region. Usually, leaks and rumors provide clarity surrounding a smartphone launch. This time, it seems the Galaxy Z Flip 7's chip situation is getting more convoluted before it becomes clear.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

But the one thing you <em>cannot</em> control is the giant creature that serves as your physical manifestation on the planet.</p><p>Just as in the Black & White games, this creature is fueled by an artificial intelligence that is essentially a living being, experimenting with the world around it and learning as it goes. Like a pet, your encouragement or discipline will help shape this pet's personality and its understanding of morality, which will directly influence the people in the world around it.</p><p>The primary goal of the game is to inspire humans to worship you — either with grace or force — which, in turn, will increase your powers as a god. As humans visit shrines to worship you, they'll generate prayer power that you can collect and use to grow your powers. As your influence grows, so does your population's notoriety worldwide.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buFk2eK6kKA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The game isn't a massive open world but, rather, a level-based strategy sandbox with a clear storyline bridging each locale together. As you and your citizens grow in influence, you'll come across enemies that want to bring you back down to size. Whether it's bandits that appear out of the fog of war or another civilization bent on war depends entirely on each scenario.</p><p>But while some of these features can be found in other games, the "virtual pet" portion of the game is unique among VR titles. It's your creature that makes How to God truly unique among Meta Quest strategy games and the thing that gives it the most character and intrigue, by far.</p><p>As a "living" creature's master, you must shape your pet to represent you in the best way since you can't micromanage it at all times. This isn't a Familiar that you summon on command, and it isn't a creature that you can just pick up and put wherever you want. It must be molded to properly represent you in the world.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YZUefCDcyj7skWLtKgpDeF" name="how-to-god-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of How to God for the Meta Quest 3 showing villagers praying at an altar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YZUefCDcyj7skWLtKgpDeF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Thoughtfish GmbH)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you've ever trained a pet before, you'll know there are very different trains of thought.

Whether you choose to expand your village and earn praise or keep the population at bay by feeding your creature — thus inciting fearful prayers and power — is entirely up to you.</p><p>I also loved the game's alchemy system. Just like in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/dimensional-double-shift-hexas-job-simulator-multiplayer">Job Simulator games</a>, How to God lets you grab different elements and combine them, like mixing fire and water to make steam. While it doesn't look nearly as intricate as those games, I'm eager to explore everything the developers have implemented, as I've been told there are dozens of combinations to be discovered.</p><p>The game is set to launch in the next few months as a single-player experience, but the developers have hinted that their goal is to eventually incorporate a multiplayer component.

Last month, an APK teardown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-messages-will-soon-use-color-to-differentiate-rcs-and-sms-mms-users">revealed color and text badges for RCS contacts</a> in the Google Messages app beta. It's now appearing widely for Google Messages beta testers, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1kxui7v/rcs_tag_is_showing_besides_the_rcs_enabled_phone/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> and reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/28/google-messages-new-chat-rcs/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>While the feature is still not available in the stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages app</a>, this expanded availability for beta testers signals it is nearing a public release. The tweak aims to make it easier to see whether a user is messaging someone using RCS messaging or old-school SMS/MMS messaging. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS can be more secure and feature-rich than SMS or MMS</a>, delivering features like reactions, read receipts, and higher-quality video.</p><p>As such, it can be advantageous to know whether the chat you're starting is with someone using RCS or not. You might want to send a long video over RCS, but not over MMS. That's why a future update will add small RCS badges next to the contact names of people who have enabled the service, with no badge for SMS/MMS texters.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1kxui7v/rcs_tag_is_showing_besides_the_rcs_enabled_phone">RCS tag is showing besides the RCS enabled phone numbers!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The change comes along with a new view for the <strong>New conversation</strong> page, which is now called <strong>New chat</strong>. Google Messages beta users will see this screen after tapping <strong>Start chat</strong>, and it'll eventually make its way to public users. RCS users will get Dynamic Color for their chats, serving as another visual cue separating new and old-school messaging options.</p><p>The update user-interface is appearing as part of Google Messages app beta <strong>version 20250527_01_RC00</strong>. While it's showing up more widely than before, it's still a limited rollout — likely occurring as a server-side push — exclusive to beta testers.</p><p>It's unclear when these UI tweaks for Google Messages will roll out for everyone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53546025&_gl=1*1ev768s*_ga*MTg5NTcwNDAxMC4xNzMzNTA5MTY1*_ga_541ENG1F9X*czE3NDg1MjQ4NjYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4NTI0ODc3JGo0OSRsMCRoMA..">new report released</a> by IDC today (May 29), global smartphone sales are now predicted to grow only by 0.6% overall in 2025.</p><p>“Since April 2nd, the smartphone industry has faced a whirlwind of uncertainty. While current exemptions on smartphones have offered temporary relief, the looming possibility of broader tariffs presents a serious risk,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.</p><p>The global market intelligence firm said that it had to lower its earlier prediction of 2.3% that it made in February, due to the high uncertainty around fluctuating tariffs, economic challenges, "such as inflation and unemployment across many regions leading to a slowdown in consumer spending."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.08%;"><img id="uuJyXBXsfxFpoxJLJbEqo3" name="IDC-phone-sales-2025-forecast" alt="IDC Decreases its Worldwide Smartphone Forecast to 0.6% for 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uuJyXBXsfxFpoxJLJbEqo3.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="488" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The report also states that smartphone sales will continue to remain low for the next five years, and may see single-digit growth, averaging at 1.4%. Several factors could cause this, and the firm attributes it to people retaining their phones for longer periods, and an increasing trend of buying refurbished smartphones instead of new ones, as they can be lighter on the pocket.</p><p>Furthermore, IDC's report claims that despite the ongoing tensions between China and the U.S., the two countries will be the major contributors to the said growth of 0.6% of smartphone sales.</p><p>"The US Market is forecast to grow 1.9% in 2025, but it was impacted from the ongoing US-China trade war as growth was pulled down from 3.3% due to increased uncertainty and tariff related price increases,” said Anthony Scarsella, research director with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1877px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="9WqGNS3zmoTLkVNET92Azj" name="huawei-mate-xt-promo-1.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate XT promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9WqGNS3zmoTLkVNET92Azj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1877" height="1056" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android phone sales in China are said to increase by 3% YoY, due to the increase in government subsidies and discounts to push smartphone sales. Which is why Apple could see a 1.9% decline in sales as Huawei takes the spotlight.</p><p>Lastly, the firm notes that recent signals from the U.S. on a potential tariff hike on smartphones have only made the future uncertain for OEMs outside the U.S., with smartphone vendors who export to the U.S. having to deal with unnecessary geopolitics. As the Trump administration was recently levying 25% on phones built outside the U.S.</p><p>"Despite these headwinds, India and Vietnam are expected to remain the key alternatives to China for smartphone production,” Popal added.</p><p>However, it is important to note that earlier today, the U.S. Court of International Trade judges <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-court-trump-recent-tariffs-halted-illegal-ieepa">ruled to halt</a> President Trump's recent 10% tariffs on "virtually every U.S. trade partner." The judges state that the administration's leverage of the IEEPA shouldn't qualify here, and that Trump has "exceeded" any rightful authority.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But the real headline is that it's locking in your rates for talk, text, and data for a full five years.</p><p>The new plans, namely Experience More ($85/month) and Experience Beyond ($100), are stepping in to replace the old Go5G Next and Go5G Plus. As for the regular Go5G plan, it's also getting the boot.</p><p>Business users are getting some extra love too with the new Experience More for Business and Experience Beyond for Business plans. The big perk is free access to Secure Wi-Fi, which is a smart VPN that kicks in automatically whenever you’re on sketchy public networks.</p><h2 id="travel-and-data-perks-2">Travel and data perks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="du63zwPBbYBDFHWBTnwQEF" name="t-mobile-logo-google-pixel-8-pro.jpg" alt="The T-Mobile Logo on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/du63zwPBbYBDFHWBTnwQEF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>T-Mobile's Experience More plan also packs unlimited talk, text, and data, along with free Netflix plan (standard tier) and Apple TV Plus thrown in. The carrier has upped the ante with 60GB hotspot data (that's 10GB more than before). When traveling, you'll get 15GB high-speed in Canada/Mexico and 5GB in over 215 countries.</p><p>One cool new thing with the Experience More plan is that it's adding satellite coverage, something the old Go5G Next didn’t have. This starts in July and stays free through the end of 2025. After that, if you want to keep the satellite service, it’ll run you $15 a month.</p><p>On the other hand, the premium Experience Beyond plan keeps satellite coverage free, with no end date in sight. You're also scoring a massive 250GB of hotspot data. It keeps the same Netflix and Apple TV Plus perks as Experience More, plus throws in Hulu with Ads as an extra bonus.</p><h2 id="business-boost-2">Business boost</h2><p>In a big win for business users, the Experience Beyond for Business plan cranks hotspot data up to 300GB. It’s built to keep remote teams and on-the-go offices connected without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Both plans throw in phone upgrade options—Experience More lets you switch it up every couple of years, while Experience Beyond lets you refresh your phone once a year.</p><p>The cool part is you get free T-Satellite with Starlink until the end of 2025. It hooks your phone up directly to satellites, so you can text even where there’s no cell signal at all.</p><p>T-Mobile says you just need a clear patch of sky to use the new T-Satellite with Starlink.

The company's data shows that the top 10 phones in this past quarter have retained "stable" overall global sales. However, Android phones are only present for spots five through nine. Interestingly, four of the top Android phones from Q1 are budget, Samsung Galaxy A series devices.</p><p>In fifth place is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-a16-5g-comes-to-the-us-with-a-bigger-screen-and-longer-software-support">Galaxy A16 5G</a>, followed by the Galaxy A06. According to the data, the former experienced a 17% YoY (year-over-year) growth, likely due to its North American launch on January 2. This took place a couple of weeks before Samsung's major flagship reveal, and that's where Counterpoint's research takes us next. Specifically, we're looking at the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is the only one of Samsung's recent flagships to break the top 10 best-selling phones.</p><p>The S25 Ultra comes in at seventh place, leaving the Redmi 14C 4G and the Galaxy A55 6G to round out the bunch.</p><p>Elsewhere, Apple's iPhones take the top four spots, which sees the base iPhone 16 taking #1. It's then followed by its other 16 series siblings, the 16 Pro Max and the 16 Pro.</p><p>Regarding sales, Counterpoint highlights devices under $100, stating phones in that category became the "fastest growing" in Q1 2025.</p><h2 id="this-time-last-year-2">This time last year...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Counterpoint adds the Galaxy S25 Ultra's placement in Q1 2025 is slightly lower than the fifth spot held by the S24 Ultra last year. The post attributes this change to the S25's "shorter sales window" in Q1. Despite that, Counterpoint's research shows the entire series has delivered "steady results" for Samsung in the year's initial quarter.</p><p>If we take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-smartphone-market-share-q1-2024">a look back at Q1 2024</a>, Samsung reclaimed its top spot for most shipped phones. Research indicated that the Korean OEM's performance was due to the popularity of its Galaxy A series from late 2023 into the next year. We're seeing a similar trend now, thanks to the recent Galaxy A16 5G launch at the start of 2025.</p><p>On the other hand, Counterpoint foresaw the premium smartphone market's growth in 2024 because of AI advancements and features on those phones. Currently, the company's report highlighted the Galaxy S25's inclusion of Google's Gemini, stating this "signals Samsung’s shift toward a more agentic AI experience, enhancing user productivity and personalization."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Per reports, the tariffs were reportedly 10% and concerned "virtually every U.S. trade partner."The U.S. Court said on Wednesday, May 28, that the tariffs have been considered illegal due to them "exceeding" the president's rightful authority.</p><p>The publication cites the judges, surfacing the following statement: "The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder."</p><p>The IEEPA, otherwise known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, is the primary catalyst here. The president's administration has leaned on the IEEPA to "justify" its recent 10% tariffs on many overseas trade partners. What's more, a White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, defended the 10% tariffs, stating the U.S. "trade deficit" with other countries has "created a national emergency that has decimated American communities."</p><p>However, the U.S. Court claims the IEEPA's true intention is to rectify any trade imbalances, not emergency action.</p><p>CBS News states the Trump Administration plans to appeal the court's roadblock.

This is not a pre-installed app with system-wide permissions; it's an app you installed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play" target="_blank">Play Store</a> or App Store, presumably <em>after</em> reading the privacy policy and understanding how your data is collected and used, and being okay with it.</p><p>Of course, nothing said "<em>Hey, we're going to record your screen, is that OK</em>?" but the store listings <strong>do</strong> tell you how your private information will be collected, but not shared. That's all T-Mobile needs to do, and what allows the company to build an app that records your screen the first time you use it and until you turn the feature off. It isn't recording anything outside the app (it can't), and it has an explanation for why it needs this information. Its bases are covered 100%.</p><p>But it still feels wrong. It leads to my real question: <em><strong>why</strong></em> is this allowed to happen?</p><h2 id="blame-apple-and-google-2">Blame Apple and Google</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aCh9Kz8bpZgVr3uzzz3Mze" name="hey-google-logo-ces-2018-2.jpg" alt="A Google Logo at CES" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aCh9Kz8bpZgVr3uzzz3Mze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Recording or otherwise <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-record-screen-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">capturing the contents of your screen</a> isn't anything new, and I think everyone has done it once or twice, at least. It can be useful for both you and for quality control from the developers and providers of an app or service. I'm not opposed to the idea on any level, and I don't think anyone should be; it's just another feature.</p><p>Where I think issues come into play is that this happens without asking. <strong>There is no way you can use the app and turn the setting off without it happening</strong>, so having a setting means little when it's enabled by default. I do not care that the only information you provide while using the app is captured, or that T-Mobile doesn't share any of it with any other party.</p><p>I care that it is enabled by default. I <em>really</em> care that Apple and Google have no problem allowing, nay, enabling this behavior. Two companies that constantly crow about your privacy and how they protect you and your data, pretending to be some sort of benevolent benefactor and a shield between you and the "bad guy."</p><div><blockquote><p>The problem isn't that T-Mobile is recording your screen; it's that this feature is enabled by default.</p></blockquote></div><p>The reality is a lot simpler and sinister: Google and Apple only care about Google and Apple, T-Mobile only cares about T-Mobile, and you have to care about yourself and your privacy. I'm very skeptical about any sort of "privacy initiatives" from huge tech companies (and often very vocal about that), but I can't see any other explanation, especially now that this has been talked about for a week.</p><p>Someone at Apple and Google has likely been made aware, and so far, no action has been taken.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vnGMiYfmuSZvbfNsE7qhs4" name="Pixel-9-home-screen" alt="Pixel 9 home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnGMiYfmuSZvbfNsE7qhs4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My complaining about policies that permit this isn't going to change anything either. A simple outcome is for T-Mobile to change one variable in the app's code from true to false, rebuild it, and send out a mandatory update. A better solution is for Apple and Google to change the rules so that while this is allowed, users need to be told up front and given a way to decide for themselves.</p><p>Most people have no idea this is happening, and a good many of them wouldn't care anyway. Google and Apple are the ones who need to care and exert better control over their platforms.</p><p>As such, Android Central has reached out to both Google and Apple to inquire about their plans for updating their privacy policies for their app stores.
