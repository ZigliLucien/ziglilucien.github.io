Users are flooding forums with complaints about a frustrating bug that leaves navigation gestures and buttons unresponsive or stuck.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/06/android-16-unresponsive-stuck-navigation-buttons-gestures-not-working-pixel-phones.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>, a number of Pixel users are chiming in on Reddit about weird issues with their navigation buttons and gestures. Some say there's a serious lag when trying to go back or switch screens — and for others, those actions just flat-out stop working.</p><p>At times, both the buttons and gestures just lag out, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1lb4dyf/3button_navigation_on_android_16_is_broken/" target="_blank">one Pixel 8 Pro user stating that it took over 30 seconds</a> before things started moving again. Meanwhile, folks with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> are also seeing the swipe-up gesture flake out.</p><h2 id="who-s-affected-2">Who’s affected?</h2><p>This glitch doesn’t seem to care which Pixel you’ve got — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1l91zbo/updating_to_android_16_made_my_pixel_6_unusable/" target="_blank">from the Pixel 6</a> to the 8 and 9 series, it’s hitting across the board. Nonetheless, some users say everything is running smooth, while others are stuck fighting their phones just to move between apps or menus.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1lb4dyf/3button_navigation_on_android_16_is_broken">3-Button Navigation on Android 16 is broken</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Android Police founder Artem Russakovskii jumped in and posted a screen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1933934882624778382" target="_blank">recording on X</a> to show just how bad the Android 16 bug can get.</p><h2 id="why-this-sucks-extra-hard-2">Why this sucks extra hard</h2><p>Navigation is your phone's muscle memory. When those swipes and taps start failing, it's not some niche feature breaking—it's like your device forgot how to device. Suddenly, apps feel broken, menus fight back, and your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">expensive Android phone</a> becomes a source of daily frustration.</p><p>What should feel effortless now takes conscious effort. And that's the ultimate tech fail: when using your phone feels like work instead of second nature.</p><p>Right now, Google is staying suspiciously quiet about these issues. If your Pixel is acting up, your best move is to hit up Google's bug report tool and add your voice to the pile. The louder the outcry, the faster we'll likely see a patch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

On top of that, a fresh leak just spilled the beans on a potentially brand-new camera setup in the works.</p><p>Tipster Digital Chat Station claims on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PwM6XAI07" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the OnePlus 15 is kicking off a whole new chapter for the brand’s cameras. Instead of continuing its partnership with Hasselblad, this one is supposedly rocking OnePlus’ very own imaging setup for the first time in a very long while.</p><p>If this switch-up is correct, it throws the future of the OnePlus–Hasselblad duo into serious doubt, a partnership that kicked off with the OnePlus 9 and put the brand among our top choices for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phones</a>. It’s too early to say how things will play out, but there’s no denying the collaboration paid off, especially in color accuracy and portrait mode. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> was reaping the benefits.</p><h2 id="camera-specs-get-messy-2">Camera specs get messy</h2><p>The latest leak also points to a triple 50MP setup on the back, consisting of the main wide, ultra-wide, and a 3x periscope zoom. But not everyone is on the same page about the OnePlus 15’s camera specs. Tipster Smart Pikachu earlier claimed it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-specs-chipset-camera-leaks">might pack a 200MP periscope lens</a>, instead of 50MP.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 is also expected to pack the SM8550 chip, which is the follow-up to the Snapdragon 8 Elite. While the official name isn’t certain yet, chances are it'll land as the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KKPidQo6wrHHkgYXNt4S" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KKPidQo6wrHHkgYXNt4S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If the leaks are on point, the OnePlus 15 might rock a flat screen similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>.

It’s a simple touch, but it makes reading the settings way more intuitive.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:385px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.42%;"><img id="XMW4JmqpmJLjp2PUYCKi4j" name="Pixel-Camera-settings-menu" alt="Material 3 Expressive redesign for the settings menu of Pixel Camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XMW4JmqpmJLjp2PUYCKi4j.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="385" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:385px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.42%;"><img id="W9VPwXMjZcfr3SLB3X8a4j" name="Pixel-Camera-settings-menu" alt="Material 3 Expressive redesign for the settings menu of Pixel Camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W9VPwXMjZcfr3SLB3X8a4j.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="385" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:385px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.42%;"><img id="PubhzNQCnBLG5GSsFegU4j" name="Pixel-Camera-settings-menu" alt="Material 3 Expressive redesign for the settings menu of Pixel Camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PubhzNQCnBLG5GSsFegU4j.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="385" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="more-than-just-a-settings-refresh-2">More than just a Settings refresh</h2><p>Right now, the changes are mostly tucked away in the Settings menu, but this is just the start.

It appears the company is having yet another product up its sleeve dubbed the OnePlus Pad Lite.</p><p>The renders of a new upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> from the company have surfaced, which were shared by Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka OnLeaks) together with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-pad-lite-design-specifications-leaked-exclusive/">91mobiles</a>. The OnePlus Pad Lite is tailored for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">budget Android tablet</a> segment and touted to be the successor to the company's first budget tablet, the OnePlus Pad Go, launched in 2023.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good Morning #FutureSquad!

It includes a single rear camera at the back, and the front should have a 11-inch LCD display. It is expected to come in 1920 x 1080 resolution with a 90Hz refresh.</p><p>Underneath, the Pad Lite is likely to include a MediaTek Helio G100 chipset with 2.2GHz clock speeds paired with up to 6GB RAM and 128GB onboard storage — with more options available during the launch. The tablet is also touted with a 9340mAh battery capacity — a significant improvement over the predecessor, which had 8000mAh.</p><p>The tablet is believed to be coming with a 5MP rear camera next to a 5MP front-facing camera. However, the predecessor had offered 8MP cameras each. The expected dimensions comprise 254.9 x 166.5 x 7.4mm and weigh around 539 grams. Overall, the device should feel a bit taller, wider, and thinner than the previous iteration.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="pEn3bEfRsiNFTE9oW4EdSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pEn3bEfRsiNFTE9oW4EdSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:819px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.26%;"><img id="wqs4sJ2dTwyNbKdHCPkZSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak-01" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wqs4sJ2dTwyNbKdHCPkZSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="819" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:85.71%;"><img id="9Tdp6HQ7dF4mV9PT9Z4fSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak-02" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Tdp6HQ7dF4mV9PT9Z4fSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="700" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="launch-still-unclear-2">Launch still unclear</h2><p>The OnePlus Pad Lite could be carrying an Aero Blue colorway with a folio cover accessory also complementary to the tablet's cover.

Instead, I found out the hard way what happens when you ignore Garmin's algorithm.</p><p>I spent May in a bit of a running slump, my mileage dipping about 40 miles from my monthly average. So I decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-need-a-fitness-reboot-this-summer-your-smartwatch-has-the-tools-you-need">rebound in June</a> with more steps and miles. I kicked things off with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">half marathon while wearing Ray-Ban Metas</a> on June 1, and then I decided that I could do another hard, hilly run on Global Running Day with a local running group.</p><p>By the end of my 7-mile run, I'd fallen behind the group and felt physically weak with a tight right hamstring. I checked my watch later and found I was right above my body's running tolerance.</p><p>But since I desperately wanted to rejuvenate my fitness efforts, I went out for a low-aerobic jog a couple of days later once my training readiness score had climbed up a bit.

At their booth, I wore a lightweight surgical HMD and a night-vision AR helmet for soldiers' targeting and guidance. I also checked out their ultra-bright microLED display, the in-vogue tech for AR glasses and smartwatches.</p><p>But Kopin's most promising tech for consumers is its NeuralDisplay. It uses "traditional RGB pixels, image-sensing pixels, and advanced signal processing algorithms" to track your eye movement and neurological response in a functional VR display.</p><p>I saw the tech in action at AWE (and you can see a video example below). The Kopin engineer shone a flashlight into his eye, and the display immediately detected his pupil dilation and adjusted the brightness and contrast to prevent any discomfort.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ipqm5IJNVSE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The version they showed off at AWE, built on OLED but compatible with microLED, can adjust the display's content automatically to match the user's gaze and simulate depth.</p><p>It can track data like the user's blinking rate to judge if the person is fatigued or enable foveated rendering, all without needing any SoC processing power. And in the case of military applications (or FPS games), this tech could determine that the user isn't looking in the direction of a threat and guide their gaze that way.</p><p>It's still an in-progress prototype that needs silicon improvements to enable better color accuracy and sensitivity. But CEO Michael Murray said that they proved wrong the naysayers who "said we couldn't pull it off," and that companies like Meta, Apple, and Anduril will be very interested in licensing their patent so that they can shed the weight of their eye-tracking cameras.

Hand tracking works pretty well on most recent headsets like the Quest and Vision Pro, but having a wearable controller adds more precision so you're not vainly struggling with missed camera inputs while trying to work.</p><p>Almost no one will end up using Sony's premium XYN headset; it's designed for "spatial content creation," meaning only enterprise users willing to drop nearly five grand to create CADs will need one. But it's still a promising sign of how immersive XR headsets are getting, and I love the flip-up display design for productivity.</p><h2 id="android-xr-smart-ring-controls-2">Android XR smart ring controls</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dgZs7Q8ensYqq49TLTPjgd" name="Android-XR-smart-ring-controls-awe-2025" alt="The author wearing a Kiwear smart ring capable of gesture controls, using it to slice fruit in Fruit Ninja on a tablet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgZs7Q8ensYqq49TLTPjgd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the Qualcomm show booth, they had a space for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250610859777/en/KiWear-Unveils-Smart-Ring-Input-Solution-for-AI-Glasses-in-Collaboration-with-Qualcomm-at-AWE-USA-2025">KiWear</a>, a smart ring reference design for gesture controls for AR, XR, and smart glasses. And it's surprisingly accurate and intuitive.</p><p>Connected to RayNeo X3 Pro glasses, the ring could control the display UI using simple finger movements or rotations around your finger. The IMU could differentiate between pinches away from or towards you for different functions, and the built-in PPG could display health data on the glasses.</p><p>You can also reach the ring out to tap virtual objects or use the ring touchpad to select or scroll. It even worked for accurate gaming controls when playing Fruit Ninja.</p><p>Given that Qualcomm announced that Android XR will support smart ring controls, I wonder if the next Samsung Galaxy Ring will be more specifically designed for XR controls to pair with Moohan and its smart glasses.

For example, color passthrough on the Quest 3 can be useful when you want to retain some awareness of your surroundings while you're flailing about playing Beat Saber. However, it does have its limitations.</p><p>If you're like me, you likely have your phone with you at all times and check it frequently. The problem with VR is that even with passthrough, it's not always easy to see what's on your screen. And if you're really like me, then you're probably blind as a bat but too stubborn to use your glasses with your VR headset, making the passthrough view even more challenging to use when trying to read text on your phone display.</p><p>Fortunately, Motorola has a solution for Quest 3 and Quest 3S owners that lets you use your phone on your VR headset. It can come in pretty handy, although it's not without its quirks, and not everyone will have access to it.</p><h2 id="what-is-smart-connect-2">What is Smart Connect?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C5odHXQPDjZAMAfcMTmFx5" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-Smart-Connect-VR-headset" alt="VR Headset option in Motorola Smart Connect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5odHXQPDjZAMAfcMTmFx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect app</a> on the Meta Quest 3 earlier this year as an easy way to stream and control your phone from within your headset.

You can select from just about any app on your phone to stream to the headset, and it'll open in a phone-like view. You can also use your phone to open any app on your VR headset by swiping up and sending it to Smart Connect.</p><p>What's great about this is that you can regularly scroll, view videos, and even send messages straight from your headset. You can also have up to three open and active apps in one window and easily move between them. You can also resize some apps by rotating or using the resize button up top, which can open certain apps like Gmail in a tablet-like view. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and not every app will scale properly.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3363px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="NN8FT4mAUSQ8tYz9vAuSCQ" name="11964c1dcda851b9432c811baba04858" alt="Streaming multiple apps via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NN8FT4mAUSQ8tYz9vAuSCQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3363" height="1891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3020px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="J7pybhoqqFGohF9DoDRUAQ" name="f8e0ca67dfb25cce9b33915afebfc6e9" alt="Gmail via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J7pybhoqqFGohF9DoDRUAQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3020" height="1698" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3054px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HXAVrLntqcoM848oHGoqBQ" name="dfbb86b9b5ee5875ff54447f6b66f6cb" alt="Gmail via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXAVrLntqcoM848oHGoqBQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3054" height="1718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For some apps, such as Instagram, you may be better off using the native Quest app, as it's more optimized for the VR display than the Smart Connect version.

For instance, with app streaming, while most apps you use are likely displayed vertically, horizontal apps (usually games) may have trouble and sometimes won't open at all. I find it helps to tap the expand button above the app to help things along, and usually it should work. However, this issue also extends to YouTube, for example, which doesn't scale properly in horizontal orientation unless you're in full-screen mode.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="JLeiYoxgpimo3nM65VwkAQ" name="0d1de276a5fa28a0adcf102ebdf0d838" alt="YouTube via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JLeiYoxgpimo3nM65VwkAQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2938" height="1653" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rAFAF8gUukQNY62tj5Mq8Q" name="accb70fead6d9e91cf4be2fa14531f8c" alt="A full-screen YouTube video via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAFAF8gUukQNY62tj5Mq8Q.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3021" height="1699" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The keyboard experience is also pretty wonky and oftentimes confusing. It's a much more limited experience than the normal Quest keyboard, so you don't have options like swiping to type or word suggestions. That means, when you make a mistake, there's no easy way to correct it without going back or deleting.</p><p>The problem is, the keyboard view and what's on the app don't always sync up correctly. If I move the cursor back to correct a word on the keyboard view, the cursor in the app will stay in place and start deleting or adding words at the end of my sentence. So it'll look correct on the keyboard but not on the app. I can always move the cursor in the app to correct the word, but then it won't do the same on the keyboard view.</p><p>The only way I found I could get around the typing experience is to just use the Gboard's voice typing, which comes in clutch. However, this is only accessible in the app view, not on the Quest keyboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QViTVbTcpcv5GFyKzTdYwP" name="e6197be6ba13efe52bff9824a81dfd73" alt="Google Messages and Gboard voice typing via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QViTVbTcpcv5GFyKzTdYwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1801" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But perhaps my biggest problem is scaling.

To exit a full-screen app in this mode, swipe down from the top of the window until a bar appears, then click the <strong>X</strong> button.</p><p>It's not the most intuitive experience, and unfortunately, many of these issues have been carried over from the desktop version of Smart Connect.</p><h2 id="a-decent-start-2">A decent start</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sK7qxGYPAJaYrqr6dDFRBQ" name="12939c99808dacb222108051a33516b3" alt="Smart Connect app streaming while Beat Saber is paused on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sK7qxGYPAJaYrqr6dDFRBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3650" height="2053" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate having to fully interrupt my VR immersion by removing the headset to check my phone.

Buttons need to be bigger, the keyboard experience needs some improvements, notifications should be more prevalent in <em>both</em> modes, and I would love to see more functions from the desktop version of Smart Connect, such as phone mirroring.</p><p>Still, this is a good start, and if you're the owner of a Quest 3 and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>, you should give Smart Connect a try.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A bad water leak inside my home means I have to replace some of my electrical wiring and almost all of my cable internet equipment as well as the water heater. Since I'm using a well, there was no usage spike on the meter to warn me I had a problem so it's hard to tell how long this has gone on, but it made one hell of a mess. What a way to start a week.</p><p>I spent the time installing one coaxial cable to a dry spot so I could reconnect my internet service. I work from home and it's vital I have it because working at McDonald's is ... well ... terrible. I appreciate them allowing me to come in and spend the afternoon and they even gave me a free coffee. You'll find some good people in the country; what you won't find is adequate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/2021-needs-focus-rural-5g-help-save-my-terrible-broadband-experience">high-speed internet</a>.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div><p>I have the "choice" of one internet provider. Ignore what you hear about competition laws and rules because they have never mattered here. My internet provider needs to replace some of their equipment (just a glorified coaxial connector) attached to my home. They will be able to do it on Wednesday. Until then, I'm left on my own. It's not the provider's fault that water damaged everything. I also understand they can't send a technician out into the woods to service one person if they're busy. My understanding doesn't help my situation.</p><p>Where all this becomes a problem is cellular coverage. Remember all the promises of nationwide wireless broadband and how it was coming thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/mobile-broadband-5g-still-needs-fixing">miracle of 5G</a>? It was a lie. I do have cell service at my house but it's not nearly fast enough to be useful for anyone who works from home. As for the "choice" of wireless providers? Mine is T-Mobile or one of several MVNOs that use T-Mobile's infrastructure. I even drove into town and grabbed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-home-internet-review">Home Internet kit</a> because someone thought it might be fast enough, but it's not.</p><p>I choose to live here because I like it here. But it's high time everyone realizes that rural communities have been told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-and-other-carriers-still-havent-covered-rural-areas-regardless-what-they-say">promise after promise</a> of how they would be brought into the 21st century with adequate information access and it never happens. Forget all the commercials and testimonials companies like to show you because all you <em>really</em> need to do is ask someone who lives it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR" name="cell-tower.jpg" alt="5g cell tower" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The worst thing is that there is no real solution to the problem outside of government-controlled broadband access. There aren't enough people here to justify new equipment or more cellular installations and corporations aren't going to lose money so I have better internet and more choice. I get that.</p><p>If you don't live in the U.S. or Canada you might not understand the situation: most of the people live in a small area in and around metropolitan areas. That means there are vast areas of space without enough people for companies to worry about. My provider (I'm not naming them because it's not their fault in the end) really doesn't care if it loses me or one of the few hundred others who live in my small community. They care about the apartments and city blocks filled with people who will happily pay their monthly fees to have service. That's who they <em>should</em> care about because they have no incentive to care otherwise. This is a problem that probably will never be fixed.</p><p>I'm not a Capitalist, Communist, Democrat, or a Republican. I care about what's best for my family. I don't want to see more government involvement when it comes to basic utilities and I have a good idea of what a federal broadband provider would end up turning into. There is room for government oversight in many areas — including broadband access — but restricted, censored, state-sponsored internet isn't the answer. There really is no answer other than me paying someone to cut down a bunch of trees and put <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/starlink-home-internet-review">a satellite dish on my roof</a>. I checked into that, too. End of July if I want it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SABvG9UwRnHW2a7UDSg49B" name="Starlink-lifestyle-lifestyle-16x9-01-08.jpg" alt="Starlink dishy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SABvG9UwRnHW2a7UDSg49B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's starting to feel like I need to make a choice. I can stay here where the air is clean, the neighbors are friendly enough to leave each other alone, and the fishing is to die for. Or I can pack up and leave, heading somewhere where my technology-focused career is better nurtured. I wish I could say to hell with it all and go back to wiring houses like I did when I was 20. Life was a lot easier and the money was good enough to pay my way through school. That can't happen because construction sites are notoriously wheelchair-unfriendly. I'm not sure what to do at this point; spending the day sitting in my chair at a sticky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/mcdonalds-google-cloud-ask-pickles-partnership">McDonald's table</a> isn't my first choice though.</p><p>You <strong>can't</strong> do anything to help even if you want to help. I don't mean me and my situation, which will work itself out by the end of next week. But about the problem as a whole. But you do need to be aware of it and be a little skeptical the next time some agency or a company tells you how they're serving millions more people across rural America. The real problems are where there aren't millions of people in the first place, but there are enough people that need someone to give a damn.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The camera is at the heart of this transformation,” the company explained.</p><p>“More than just a tool for capturing images, coupled with enhanced AI-powered features, the Galaxy camera is now part of the intuitive interface that turns what users see into understanding and action.”</p><p>The company also adds that these cameras will easily adapt to the users' needs and make capturing moments more personal and seamless, with the power of AI.</p><hr><h2 id="galaxy-watch-8-shows-renders-show-up-online-2">Galaxy Watch 8 shows renders show up online</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Y2JgXdyhUcT9xxTp3ydHaW" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-base-model-render-leak" alt="A leaked rendering of the base Galaxy Watch 8 suggests it will receive a simpler, cleaner squircle design with two physical buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2JgXdyhUcT9xxTp3ydHaW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-clean-simple-squircle-ultra-redesign-leak"><strong>here </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leaked-on-ebay"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 leaks keep getting better.  This week, leaked renders of the alleged watch showed up online, giving us a good idea of what the actual device might look like.</p><p>The renders suggested that the Galaxy Watch 8 would show up with a squircle design, as seen in previous leaks as well. The renders of the device show the wearable in a sleeker design, with white straps, a square-ish silver base, and its circular watch face on top. The Watch 8 is speculated to have only two physical buttons and come in two sizes.</p><p>Additionally, someone ended up uploading pictures of the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on eBay. In the listing, the smartwatch is seen with a leather strap, a circular (more squircle) design, with a prominent crown sitting between two buttons. The speakers are also seen on one side of the smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is expected to show up with a steel or titanium finish.</p><hr><h2 id="the-week-of-outages-2">The week of outages</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD" name="Google-services.jpg" alt="Google apps in a single folder on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/theres-a-massive-chatgpt-outage-maybe-its-time-to-switch-over-to-gemini"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-spotify-amazon-and-more-hit-by-a-widespread-outage-impacting-thousands"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>This week saw outages on several online platforms, beginning with ChatGPT on June 10, where users experienced a massive 12-hour outage.

They give you a lot for $129. Let’s talk about the hardware first! I’ll address the app in a bit.</p><p>The Liberty 5 are the successor to the Liberty 4 NC, but they do contain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/soundcore-liberty-4-pro-review" target="_blank">elements of the Liberty 4 Pro</a>. Aesthetically, the first thing you’ll notice is that the case looks and slides like the Liberty 4 Pro, minus the in-case display and touch bar. Slide the lid up, and you get a pairing button inside.</p><p>Below that, on the lip of the bottom half, you’ll find a light bar that indicates battery and connection status but is difficult to see outdoors, even in overcast sunlight. The case charges via USB-C and Qi wireless connections and has a matte finish that resists fingerprints very well, in contrast to the fingerprint magnet that is the Liberty 4 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="BC9LnV2ZURSAzBWY9vhxNJ" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-buds.JPG" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 earbuds. out of their case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BC9LnV2ZURSAzBWY9vhxNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pop the earbuds out of the case, and you’ll find the same stem-style buds found in the previous generation, along with the clicky stem-based controls. In my couple of weeks with the earbuds, those controls took a bit of getting used to, but once I did, they were reliable and didn’t give me any false triggering issues when adjusting or readjusting them during exercise.</p><p>With the Liberty 5 earbuds, you’ll have five additional ear tips to choose from (shown in the gallery above). I used the default ear tips (mediums), which worked fine. Adjusting the seal of the right ear with the small gave me a better fit, so I stuck with that configuration for the remainder of my review period.</p><p>I appreciate that the white ear tips have a barely visible marking on them, indicating the size, so if you want to switch, you immediately know what you had in and which option you may want to try next.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:827px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.43%;"><img id="nEnSUCJGxiVsxT3Rs2g5MK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-device-setup" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Google setup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nEnSUCJGxiVsxT3Rs2g5MK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="827" height="1856" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="Fxqaixe2f2r7sWrvXRKAKK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-home" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Soundcore app home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fxqaixe2f2r7sWrvXRKAKK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="BMGS7TfwWFdhBJaFn2iyKK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-settings" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Soundcore app, more settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BMGS7TfwWFdhBJaFn2iyKK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-cancellation-levels" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="V2chFyqZGXuRRxRJJ8Wsv6" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-ldac" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app Sound Mode settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2chFyqZGXuRRxRJJ8Wsv6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The app is highly customizable, featuring an 8-band EQ and 22 preset options, as well as the ability to create custom presets tailored to your hearing preferences.</p><p>There’s a gaming mode, the ability to switch between AAC and LDAC playback, and the option to adjust the strength of the ANC.

The 4 Pro presented a relatively balanced stereo image out of the box. The Liberty 5, on the other hand, are bass-heavy throughout most of the default sound profiles offered. If you’re a bass lover, this may not be bad, but it isn’t optimal and doesn’t present the full sonic image that the Liberty 5 can produce.</p><p>Overall, I’d characterize the default sound as having a very warm bottom in the upper bass with a lighter sub-bass punch. Mids are scooped, and highs are bright but compete with the amped lows.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="PifebBBT2Xbzn6R3UVtRAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-preference" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings Preference Test" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PifebBBT2Xbzn6R3UVtRAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="DQNB6DjCdw4yYngUxkGADe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-hearID" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings HearID" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DQNB6DjCdw4yYngUxkGADe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="GtQzm529zYrvz6jN8fQCAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-EQ-8band" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings 8-band EQ" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GtQzm529zYrvz6jN8fQCAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-cancellation-levels" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings ANC levels customization" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Once you’ve connected your Liberty 5 and you dive into the app, you’ll find two different sound options that allow you to better tailor the output: Preference Test and HearID Sound Test. Preference tailors sound based on perception, while HearID tailors sound based on your level of hearing loss, if any.</p><p>I prefer HearID over the Preference Test because it compensates for hearing loss across the audible frequency spectrum, so your EQ will be “true.” Once I updated my HearID test, something I hadn’t done in 12 months, and made a couple of small tweaks to the Preference Test settings, the sound quality was much more balanced and nuanced.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CSLnxtUF3PHSvsNH9EQRKG" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-in-ear-alt" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 shown being worn by the reviewer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSLnxtUF3PHSvsNH9EQRKG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With my sonic profile preferences sorted, I hit my DSF files and played one of my “go-tos” for testing nuance: Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Startin’ Something.” The intro has backing vocals that get lost with less capably tuned earbuds and headphones, but the Liberty 5 reproduced those vocals and the nuance in that track with aplomb.</p><p>The same can be said for the high-bitrate PCM Marvin Gaye files I listened to. Looking at the Developer Options menu on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, confirming that I was streaming “Trouble Man” and “Ain’t Nothing Like The Real Thing,” using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained" target="_blank">LDAC at 32bits/96kHz</a>, the experience was very satisfying.</p><p>Gaye’s arrangements are orchestral and expertly mastered, imparting a beautiful sense of space and nuanced instrumentation that is robust in its basslines and highs. His vocals and falsetto are top-tier, so much of that can get lost with a lesser pair of earbuds. Not the case with these. His vocals are bright and full of texture, as are Tammi Terrell’s, and the combination of their voices on that duet, presented through these earbuds, is immersive and highly entertaining.</p><p>Every other genre I threw at the Liberty 5 was well represented. The Liberty 5 proves to be a capable pair of relatively inexpensive Bluetooth earbuds that are sonically proficient with everything from speed metal to hip-hop to film scores and soundtracks.</p><p>Mic quality is clear, but on some calls, it sounded like I was in a closet. In one of my Discord chats, I left a nearly three-minute voice message for the group and listened to it back.

My go-to choice right now is the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro, but I've been using Bose's QuietComfort Ultra for close to a month now, and they've been incredible.</p><p>The QuietComfort Ultra aren't affordable by any measure; they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-World-Class-Cancellation/dp/B0CD2FSRDD">retail for $299 on Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-in-ear-earbuds-lunar-blue/6589910.p?skuId=6589910">Best Buy</a>, and that's $100 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56">more than the Sony WF-1000XM5</a> (which are on sale from their $299 retail). Annoyingly, Bose's earbuds miss out on niceties like wireless charging, which is available on most $100 models these days. The case is on the bulkier side as well, and while it is still pocketable, I don't get why it's so much bigger than most other products in this category.</p><p>Thankfully, that's about the only drawback I've had with the QuietComfort Ultra; these earbuds combine a great fit with a fabulous bass-heavy sound signature, and they easily connect to two devices at once. The best part is that with Snapdragon Sound integration, you can unlock higher-quality streams — if you've got a phone that also has the requisite codecs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2hy7wUhkYg4ho5adkUnqwe" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2hy7wUhkYg4ho5adkUnqwe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I used the QuietComfort Ultra with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> as the phone comes with Snapdragon Sound as well, and it was a good pairing.

The distinctive design with a bulbous shell makes the buds highly comfortable to wear, and while you don't get as secure a fit as the buds don't nestle into your ear cavity quite as much, I didn't have any problems doing chores around the house with these on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gboYghvM9ZtrNNT6irvMue" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gboYghvM9ZtrNNT6irvMue.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Connectivity is via Bluetooth 5.3, and the earbuds have Google Fast Pair, so it was easy to connect to various devices.

This appearance was likely for its rumored chip, which the leak claims is MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC. Strangely, the publication reports the tablet scored "lower than smartphones" with MediaTek's flagship chip.</p><p>The Geekbench listing reportedly states the S11 Ultra achieved a score of 5,312 in its multi-core test and 1,420 in the single-core run.</p><p>There were some smaller specs posted in the listing, like the existence of Android 16 and 12GB of RAM. Still no word on its internal storage; however, there's a chance Samsung could pop 256GB in it to match that 12GB of RAM, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><h2 id="an-ultra-look-2">An Ultra Look</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra leaks bring new information forward while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-battery-specifications-leak">also switching up the narrative</a> on a key specification: its SoC of choice. In a previous leak, the tablet was rumored to receive MediaTek's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400</a> SoC from late last year. This chip was the company's flagship response to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. However, what this alleged Geekbench listing purports is the brand's updated (and upgraded) variant.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus</a> offers a Big Core design with one Arm Cortex-X925 core at 3.73GHz. The company was adamant during its launch that this chip could "propel" users' experience with Android UX. What's more, the chip is paired with the 12-core Arm Immortalis-G925 GPU for "PC-like" graphical features on Android phones.</p><p>The SoC launched in April, and it seems Samsung could opt for this leveled-up version of MediaTek's flagship prowess.</p><p>Other Galaxy Tab S11 series rumors claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">will drop the Plus model in 2025</a>, bringing back its base model, which was absent last year. While the base model could see a familiar 8,160mAh battery, the Ultra model might jump 500mAh to ~11,374mAh.</p><p>Speculation claims Samsung might hold onto its next flagship tablet series until after its summer Unpacked. This means we might not see them until the fall at the latest.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ipad-tablets-ereaders/tablets/pcmcat209000050008.c?id=pcmcat209000050008"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=tablet"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/tablets-laptops-computers-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablet&crid=2HCFROTF588S1&sprefix=tablet%2Caps%2C159&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Google states this alternative overview is said to leverage the latest Gemini models for "quick, conversational" results for "certain" queries. Google remains confident that this feature (in testing) can help users understand information with convenience.</p><p>After searching, it seems Google's Audio Overviews in Search will appear as an option for users to receive. The post states testers will notice a "generate" button if the feature is available for that particular query.</p><p>If you opt into it, Audio Overviews will be housed in their own contained space within your results. Marked by a "Search Labs" experience label, the overview will inform users about what it entails. For example, users would see a "Listen to..." starter, followed by whatever the topic is you've searched for, like noise cancellation in headphones.</p><p>Following that is the Audio Overview itself, with a play button and how long Google's AI will be speaking about the subject. Similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-year-later-research-report">Search's regular AI Overviews</a>, users will see citations detailing where the model got its information.

Additionally, if this interests you, users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/30">join the Search Labs experience</a> to begin trying it today (June 13).</p><p>Google's AI Overviews have continued to evolve; however, this alternative mirrors what was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">given through NotebookLM</a>. In September, Google rolled out Audio Overviews to NotebookLM, a journal-based app that lets users go in-depth with their research/learning for better understanding. For this app, Audio Overviews utilized two AI "co-hosts" for a conversational, podcast-like creation.</p><p>One primary difference here is that NotebookLM's version leverages information contained within <em>your </em>documents. The AI tries its best to condense this information in a way that facilitates better understanding. Additionally, users can guide these AI toward specific talking points and even pose questions.</p><p>Google's version in this Search test seems restricted to the AI delivering its best version of condensed information for the user. There's a chance the company could bring similar NotebookLM features to Search, but that remains speculative for now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

From the stand's blown-up render, it seems the Korean OEM has succeeded in trimming down the next book-style Fold. The device is partly open in this shot, giving us a look at each half, which appears much thinner than the Fold 6.</p><p>The foldable still retains its rounded corners on the right half of its frame. However, another point of interest is its hinge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:476px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:126.05%;"><img id="3HTwojuYbV4CaoxhyufQde" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-promotional-thinner-photo" alt="A photo of Samsung's promotional standee for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which appears much thinner than the Fold 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3HTwojuYbV4CaoxhyufQde.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="476" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The hinge, which can be responsible for giving a much larger size to the foldable, might've slimmed down slightly for this next iteration. With that, there's a chance that when folded, the Fold 7's displays will sit much closer together, especially toward the hinge. Typically, there's a bit of a gap there due to its functionality, but Samsung may cut this down even more than it did with its predecessor.</p><h2 id="a-foldable-summer-with-a-bigger-camera-bump-2">A Foldable Summer... with a bigger camera bump?</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge">galaxyfold</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge">r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Aside from that, another GalaxyFold subreddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge/">post by a separate user</a> highlights a leaked look at an upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 case (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/13/galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-bump-leak/">9to5Google</a>). While this is a Thinborne case, the purpose of this photo is the camera bump and how large it seems to be. From the angled top view, things appear quite nominal. However, when shown the side view, the Fold 7's camera bump protrudes quite harshly from the back of the device.</p><p>There's something to note here: the Fold 7's triple camera array (in older leaked imagery) sits on an elevated island. Moreover, the leaked case's protection is likely ever-so-slightly higher than the island to protect the lenses when set down.</p><p>Either way, as the original poster notes, "The thickness of the camera bump is almost just as thick as the phone itself (in folded mode)."</p><p>Something a little more "concrete" to look at would be a recent leak from May, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/someone-got-their-hands-on-the-alleged-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-heres-the-first-look">as a user allegedly got their hands on</a> the Fold 7 early. Wrapped in plastic, the user took a photo of the device in question, showing off its triple camera array with black rings, similar to its past version, and the direction <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">the Galaxy S25</a> has gone. It was unclear just how large Samsung's camera island for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 would be, but this latest leaked render from Reddit might've given us all we need to know.</p><p>More than that, rumors claim the Fold 7 is roughly 4.5mm when unfolded, which is a bit thinner than the Fold 6's ~5.6mm measurement.</p><p>The Fold 7 is also purported to provide a huge 200MP camera, finally moving away from 50MP. Considering the camera bump's supposed increase, these camera upgrades could be the culprit, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">we've seen Google discuss before</a> with its Pixel 9.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Although "smarter" watches and wearables replaced the brand, founder Eric Migicovsky is bringing the concept back under a new company called Core Devices. Roughly a half-year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/hell-yeah-theyre-bringing-pebble-watches-back">after Migicovsky first announced his plans</a>, the refreshed Core 2 Duo watch is about to start shipping to customers and a new app is on the way.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/core-2-duo-alphabeta-test-signup" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Migicovsky confirms that Core Devices has already built 200 units of the Core 2 Duo watch, and it's nearing mass production. The company is on track to ship all pre-orders for the Core 2 Duo in July and August, and some beta testers will get their orders early. The Core Time 2 is a bit further out from mass production and shipping, but Migicovsky says it's still on schedule, with engineering samples slated for next month.</p><p>As part of the "RePebble" project, Google generously open-sourced PebbleOS, helping make the entire endeavor possible. That doesn't just benefit buyers of new Core Devices products, but also existing Pebble users and at-home tinkerers. Anyone can play around with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/coredevices/pebbleos" target="_blank">PebbleOS on GitHub</a>. More importantly, Migicovsky's reboot may give new life to people who still have a working Pebble watch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K" name="pebble-core-duo-2-time-2-smartwatches-hero" alt="A rendering depicting Core Devices' new PebbleOS smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and the Time 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2037" height="1146" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"You can join the test even if you didn’t pre-order a Core 2 Duo," Migicovsky writes, "if you have an old working Pebble Time (Steel/Round) or Pebble 2 watch, you can join the beta to help test the new iOS and Android mobile app."</p><p>"Our new app works with your old Pebble!"</p><p>Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forms.gle/iRK9MoW8v7th5RVHA" target="_blank">sign up for the beta test here</a>, but be warned, Migicovsky says this project is only for people willing to avoid public criticism and provide detailed reports and feedback. "This is actually going to be a lot of fun (for the right person)," he writes. "I just want to make sure we're on the same page."</p><p>For people with a Core 2 Duo pre-order, expect an email confirmation this month to work out the final shipping details for your order. That includes providing a shipping address and "to pay duties/tariffs/taxes for your country." As of now, it seems Core Devices' Pebble refresh is close to becoming a reality.</p><p>You can pre-order a Core Devices watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.repebble.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature is wrapped in Google's recent stretch of June <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">Google System Release patches</a>, specifically for its Play Services. The company details this as a "Safety & Emergency" update, stating Wear OS users will soon see alerts "when an earthquake is expected."</p><p>Rahman reiterates that Google's been working on this for a few months now, after a teardown surfaced a few details.</p><p>According to the post, these earthquake alerts on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS devices</a> will display the quake's "magnitude" and "estimated distance to the epicenter." Users should, of course, take this information seriously if it ever happens and take the appropriate action to ensure their safety. Moreover, it seems Google is putting a blanket over every Wear OS user, bringing this feature to more than just "high-risk" areas, as it's done before on Android.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google's Play Services update for June includes a few bug fixes related to its Wallet app and developer updates for "Account Management" in apps. Google's changelog announced this safety feature last week, but it appears to be rolling out very slowly.</p><h2 id="ahead-of-danger-2">Ahead of Danger</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-trekking-poles" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting atop a pair of trekking poles, with the watch face including a step count of 11,800." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google first launched its Earthquake Alerts System back in 2020 and expanded its access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-earthquake-alerts-system-expands-greece-new-zealand">to more countries in 2021</a>. Essentially, the system turns your phone into a portable seismometer using its accelerometer to detect changes in the planet. The information your phone detects is sent to Google's servers, which are then "crowdsourced" with other Android phones to see if a quake is truly happening.</p><p>If confirmed, Google's system will alert all Android users within the quake's range to get to safety.

You could even make the purchase through Affirm to pay $30 per month for the phone-and-service bundle.

Both offers are exceptional, but having my phone bill covered for a year sounds too good to pass up. </p><p>The problem is that some folks may not want to commit to a single data plan for two years.

This is where we'll likely see the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, Galaxy Watch 8, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">Project Moohan</a> (likely) or a Galaxy Ring 2 (less likely). Needless to say, Unpacked is going to be packed to the gills.</p><p>I can't help but notice that Samsung's messaging to this point has largely been focused on the larger Galaxy foldable. It started with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-drops-a-swift-tease-for-a-potential-z-fold-ultra">teaser</a>, showcasing a silhouette of a book-style foldable, accompanied by a caption reading "Meet the next chapter of Ultra." Then, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-promises-sleek-durable-galaxy-z-series-incoming">blog post</a> was published that focuses on how the unknown device is "Thin, Light, and Built to Last."</p><p>The most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-teases-ai-camera-with-situational-awareness-for-galaxy-z-fold-7-ultra">teaser</a> focuses on the camera system and how AI is expected to improve, arguably the most frustrating aspect of the previous model. Given the constant flow of features from Google, courtesy of tools like Gemini Live, I would expect this to be the case.</p><h2 id="the-lack-of-confidence-is-evident-2">The lack of confidence is evident</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, a recent report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=36892">The Elec</a> suggests Samsung has lowered its projected sales figures for both the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7. The report notes that in May alone, Samsung was expected to produce approximately 1.6 million units, with the Fold 7 accounting for 800,000 units. Now, that figure has reportedly been lowered to around 1.34 million devices, with the Fold 7 dropping to around 630,000 units.</p><p>Assuming the report is correct, which should always be taken with a grain of salt, I'm left wondering what's going on. For one, I don't recall the last time Samsung started building this much hype for its foldable phones ahead of an official announcement, at least not with this kind of cadence.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="bWHFWV8EWSvYqs6RX48iLZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-series-gif" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 7 teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bWHFWV8EWSvYqs6RX48iLZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, why is Samsung trying to hype a product that it reportedly expects to fall short of its targets? The obvious answer is that Samsung could just be hoping to exceed expectations for the first time in years. But to me, something about the whole situation just doesn't sit right.</p><p>Could Samsung actually introduce a Galaxy Z Fold Ultra? I doubt it. There are numerous factors that work against this idea, particularly in the context of the ongoing trade and tariff dispute in the United States. Furthermore, the economic climate in this region is far too volatile, and an "Ultra" foldable would likely surpass the $2,000 mark, making it out of reach for many.</p><h2 id="falling-behind-2">Falling behind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7jwzkz8wDPWgfTrWxwfqq4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7jwzkz8wDPWgfTrWxwfqq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No matter what comes of the 2025 Galaxy Z Fold family, if it doesn't meet Samsung's expectations, they really only have themselves to blame. Although the software experience is as great as it gets compared to the competition, Samsung has fallen far behind in the design department.</p><p>Other foldable phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review" target="_blank">Oppo Find N5</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review" target="_blank">Honor Magic V3,</a> make the Galaxy Z Fold 6 look a few years older than it actually is. Not to mention that both of those devices offer better camera hardware, bigger batteries, and less noticeable creases.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="n2Z8YQi3u6AvPaiK8xDsFM" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold inner screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n2Z8YQi3u6AvPaiK8xDsFM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is quick to point and laugh at Apple, but it's also one of the first to follow in Apple's footsteps. This is exactly what happened with the Fold lineup, as Samsung only made minor tweaks to the hardware, resulting in a phone that didn't look much different from the one before it.</p><p>Instead of being the industry leader it should be, Samsung sat back and coasted for too long, and the people responded with their wallets. Proof of that came <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-9-pro-fold-a-crowd-favorite-in-europe">via Counterpoint Research</a>, which reported that Samsung "saw a 24% drop in sales in Q1 this year."</p><h2 id="what-about-a-galaxy-fold-fe-2">What about a Galaxy Fold FE?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bgGzMBiUX8b7cH9Tj5kZaM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-12.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgGzMBiUX8b7cH9Tj5kZaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there's the potential for Samsung to launch a cheaper Galaxy Z Fold FE to boost sales.

Samsung hasn't proven that it can make a foldable that keeps pace with the Oppo Find N5 or Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Software-wise, yes, the Fold 6 is the clear winner.

Recently, Nothing's CEO Carl Pei sat down with the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/nothings-new-phone-3-will-be-available-for-general-sale-in-the-us/">TechCrunch</a> to discuss the phone's availability, specifically in the North American region.</p><p>Speaking to the publication, Pei pointed out that the company always had plans to bring the new flagship model to the U.S. "We have always said we are building for the long term, and now we’re ready to take that next step in the U.S. Phone (3) is not just another launch. It is a signal of where we are as a company," he added.</p><p>As for the availability of the device, the publication notes that, Phone 3 will support AT&T and T-Mobile coverage in the U.S. with multi-band support for 4G and 5G — broadening its carrier compatibility from its previous models. The Nothing Phone 3 will also be sold via the company's website and on Amazon.</p><p>Additionally, TechCrunch mentions, Nothing is partnering with Best Buy to sell its new flagship, along with its first-ever over-ear headphone model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-will-launch-its-first-over-the-ear-headphones-in-july-along-with-phone-3">Headphone 1</a>, that is set to launch on July 1 as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Historically, Nothing's flagship phones have been somewhat difficult to obtain in the U.S. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-hands-on-preview-impressions" target="_blank">Phone 1</a> was not officially released for general sale in the U.S., but was made available through a "Beta Membership" program.

Pei replied, saying "100%," with the American flag emoji next to it.</p><p>Furthermore, the publication stated that the company saw a significant number of users switching from other brands to Nothing, which is why it plans to intensify efforts to attract even more North American customers. Pei added that the U.S. smartphone market is dominated by two players (likely Samsung and Apple), and that people are seeking a change from this norm.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Come to Play.Phone (3). 1 July, 18:00 BST. pic.twitter.com/9afIpKao1s<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1929870704968606029">June 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Nothing phones are known for their distinctive design, including the customizable Glyph Interface and transparent elements, which set them apart from most other major smartphones on the market.

If you've got an eligible Pixel (Pixel 6 and above), you can install Android 16 right now, and while it is short on exciting new features — those are coming later this year — it brings plenty of usability changes.</p><p>With Android 16 behind us, Google is hard at work on Android 17. While we don't know what features will end up in the next iteration of Android, we can make several guesses — Google omitted features in the stable Android 16 build that showed up in the beta, and there's a good likelihood that these will end up in Android 17.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-17-codename"><span>Android 17 codename</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bhbnqR836Prgab3a3nfy8X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhbnqR836Prgab3a3nfy8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google doesn't have dessert codenames — that ended with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-10-review-one-year-later-oneui-oxygenos-miui-coloros">Android 10</a> — but it still uses internal codenames with Android releases. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> was Upside Down Cake, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> was Vanilla Ice Cream, and with Android 16, Google switched back to Baklava, so if it maintains a consistent naming scheme, Android 17 will likely be something around C, so we could get cheesecake or chocolate bar.</p><p>These things leak well in advance, so we don't have to wait too long to know more about the codename or release details.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-17-features"><span>Android 17 features</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DiDNbkVmw8rcHpXSwjhu9X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DiDNbkVmw8rcHpXSwjhu9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We are well past the point where new Android versions get groundbreaking features; the goal with every new version update is to bring tweaks to security and privacy features, and deliver usability changes that make a difference in daily use. That said, Google just showcased a bold new design language with Android 16, dubbed Material 3 Expressive.</p><p>There's just one problem — Material 3 Expressive isn't launching until Q4 2025 on Pixels, and that means other devices will miss out on the UI overhaul at least until Android 17. That is if manufacturers like Samsung, OPPO, Vivo, and Xiaomi even bother to integrate the design aesthetic.</p><p>That wasn't the case with Material You on these devices; while these brands used some features like the dynamic color picker, they broadly retained their distinct visual styling in lieu of the vibrant hues of Google's design. While it would be great to see a Vivo phone with a UI similar to that of a Pixel, that just isn't going to be possible.</p><p>We should get a better idea of the features in the coming weeks, but Android 17 should get better protections against local internet access and factory reset. Google showcased these features this year, but they didn't make it to Android 16, so it's a good bet that they're going to debut next year.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-17-release-date"><span>Android 17 release date</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kpwXQ7avAaS9vB9H8gVcVP" name="pixel-9-9-pro-xl-3.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL beside Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpwXQ7avAaS9vB9H8gVcVP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google switched up its Android strategy with Android 16; instead of releasing the stable build at the end of Q3 or early Q4, it introduced the release in Q2. Ostensibly, this is to ensure that devices launching in the fall — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> — debut with the latest Android build instead of getting the update later in the year.</p><p>In addition to that, Google is releasing a secondary Android update that will come out in Q4, dubbed the minor release. It's clear that this is the path the search giant is taking with Android in general, and we should see initial Android 17 builds sometime in the month of November 2025. That was the case last year with Android 16, and there's no reason to suggest Google would alter its timeline with Android 17.</p><p>Obviously, we're light on details regarding Android 17 at the moment, but that will change over the coming weeks as Google details its plans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

They cost $400 bundled with the Smart Tx transmitter, or $350 if you want to leave it out. Both should see price drops within 12 months, and JBL sometimes leaves certain legacy products in its inventory for longer periods. They come in black, blue, and mocha.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jbl-tour-one-m3-what-s-good"><span>JBL Tour One M3: What's good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kSN5bfAsVRp2mQdLJZSk49" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-wearing" alt="Wearing the JBL Tour One M3 view from the side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kSN5bfAsVRp2mQdLJZSk49.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Buying guides</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/summer-travel-guide-2025-headphones-earbuds"><strong>Best headphones to travel with</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"><strong>Best wireless headphones</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones"><strong>Best noise-cancelling headphones</strong></a><strong></strong></p></div></div><p>Headphones starting at $350-$400 need to be good at several things: sound, noise cancellation, comfort, personalization, and battery life, among others. The JBL Tour One M3 have the comfort part down pat. Wearing them for hours on multiple flights, I would never feel constrained or like I had to give my ears some air. The soft cushioning on both the ear cups and headband is JBL's staple at this point, but I’m happy to report they’ve been thoughtfully put together here.</p><p>The included case is also nicely designed with a large pouch on the other inner side to make room for the cables, though I had more success laying the Smart Tx transmitter in an open space next to the headphones (and keeping from losing it). The Tour One M3 fold flat to accommodate this, with the overall benefit being that they take up less room when traveling or commuting with them. That’s definitely one thing I can attest to on my travels.</p><p>There’s also an adaptability factor here that I think you might appreciate as well. The Smart Tx transmitter plays multiple roles and is very much a carryover from JBL’s premium wireless earbuds, like the Tour Pro 3, whose cases have built-in LCD screens. As a transmitter, the Smart Tx is easy to plug into an airliner’s entertainment screen to enjoy wireless playback.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MSRM9mEjBZeMhkBuxHJq29" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-Smart-Tx" alt="Smart Tx transmitter showing spatial audio settings for JBL Tour One M3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MSRM9mEjBZeMhkBuxHJq29.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Using the included USB-C-to-3.5mm cable, I just plug the Smart Tx into the system, and it passes through all audio to the Tour One M3 headphones. I actually kind of laughed when I walked over to a nearby restroom and could still hear the show I was watching. The only downside is that I had to leave the transmitter dangling from the Aux-In port on the screen. It can also work with TVs and older stereo systems that don’t have Bluetooth connectivity, only without the benefit of having it within arm’s reach.</p><p>Previous Tour One models have 3.5mm inputs, except JBL removed it from the M3. That makes the transmitter more useful in cases where Bluetooth isn’t a built-in option. It also means, however, that you can’t use a DAC (digital-to-analog converter) with a 3.5mm input in case you want to give audio a boost that way — though you certainly can via USB-C, so it’s not a total loss.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="LuS3C4iiwh8xwzCUwHkYt8" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-screenshots-1" alt="Screenshots showing JBL Headphones app with Tour One M3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LuS3C4iiwh8xwzCUwHkYt8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, JBL approaches sound in a few different ways. By any standard, JBL’s Headphones app is one of the most comprehensive I’ve seen, largely due to the level of customization it offers. I recommend going through these options first because the Tour One M3 hit a different sonic stride when you do. The equalizer offers decent presets, along with the ability to create your own.</p><p>Personi-Fi is a hearing test that adjusts the overall sound profile to enhance the highs, mids, and lows based on the results, leading to what should be a noticeable difference. The catch is that you need to pay close attention in a quiet space while taking the test, as you must press and hold, releasing only when you stop hearing the beep. If you’re off too much on this, it can throw off the sound a fair bit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="AoCxEpFdjuzBiei5jyYwr8" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-screenshots-2" alt="Screenshots showing audio customization for JBL Tour One M3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AoCxEpFdjuzBiei5jyYwr8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My first go round boosted treble way too high to my right ear, so I did it again and got a corrected result that sounds great. The beauty of this is that it’s so subjective; those with hearing loss can also benefit from personalized sound that suits them rather than a uniform sound signature all must accept.</p><p>The resulting sound profile applies regardless of what you’re listening to or the mode you use, whether it's an equalizer preset or Spatial Sound (fixed or head tracking). The one exception is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC hi-res Bluetooth codec</a>. Turn that on, and it disables both Personi-Fi and Spatial Sound. It also annoyingly forces the headphones to reboot.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="k8DBtwFnEqjSPrtRW7xv69" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-close-up" alt="Close-up view of the JBL Tour One M3 right earcup." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k8DBtwFnEqjSPrtRW7xv69.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A further boost to the audio experience is surprisingly robust and effective active noise cancellation (ANC). It’s not that JBL has a bad reputation for snuffing out background noise; it’s just that the Tour One M3 feel like a major step forward in consistency. Wearing them on a long flight, I couldn’t hear much of anything around me, save for the faded cries of a nearby baby. The only time I knew the crew made an announcement was when my screen said so. Even in a busy street environment or at work, the ANC shines.</p><p>JBL also offers some custom choices, letting you decide the noise cancellation level and whether you want the onboard microphones to make the call based on surrounding noise through Adaptive ANC. While they won’t unseat Sony or Bose’s best, the Tour One M3 suddenly look like upstarts worthy of being in the conversation among them. Another significant reason is the comfortable fit and passive isolation that the cups provide.</p><div><blockquote><p>Smart Talk lets you determine how long audio volume lowers once you start talking.</p></blockquote></div><p>This makes it easier to immerse yourself in a show or movie as well. Video mode reduces the Bluetooth latency to an acceptable level for audio-video sync. It’s not perfect, mind you, but I didn’t really feel like it was off all that much, and stopped noticing after a while. Even Spatial Sound gives you the choice to switch between music, movies, and gaming to take advantage of the virtual surround effect.</p><p>Ambient Aware is also very effective, but I particularly like TalkThru as a means to keep some of the background noise down while still conversing with someone. Smart Talk lets you determine how long the audio volume lowers once you start talking. This way, you can briefly chat with someone without having to pause first. Wear sensors will automatically pause playback when you take them off (although with a slight delay), resuming again when you put them back on. Multipoint support also means you can keep them paired with two devices simultaneously.</p><div><blockquote><p>There are numerous modes and features that can immerse you or keep you engaged in a conversation.</p></blockquote></div><p>Phone calls are also solid — and again — what feels like a big step forward as well. Callers didn’t realize I was talking to them hands-free through headphones. In case you find it’s not enough, JBL offers a couple of boosting options for that, too.</p><p>Onboard controls are a hybrid of physical and touch buttons. Pressing the action button cycles between ANC and Ambient Aware (or both off, if you prefer), while a double-click toggles TalkThru on and off. Touch controls are on the right earcup, where a simple tap plays/pauses, a double tap skips a track, a triple tap repeats one, and holding activates your phone’s voice assistance. For calls, double taps answer incoming calls and end ongoing calls, while holding rejects an incoming call or toggles mute on or off. All of them work pretty seamlessly, though you have no way to customize them as you want.</p><p>Battery life is great, lasting over 50 hours without issue. Volume levels will affect that number, but that’s pretty much the over/under for these cans. All told, it’s some of the best battery life you’ll find at this price, beating out Sony and Bose by a huge margin.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jbl-tour-one-m3-smart-tx-transmitter"><span>JBL Tour One M3: Smart Tx transmitter</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4Ja66NQhR2m5d3eKv2KX69" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-Auracast" alt="Smart Tx transmitter for JBL Tour One M3 showing Auracast mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Ja66NQhR2m5d3eKv2KX69.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024"><strong>I finally tried Auracast, and it feels like Bluetooth's final form</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me"><strong>Ask Jerry: Can Auracast help me?</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-to-use-bluetooth-audio-sharing-on-google-pixel"><strong>How to use Bluetooth audio sharing on a Google Pixel phone</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Before I move on, I have to revisit the Smart Tx transmitter again because of what it represents. Much like the app, the device gives you a lot of control over the Tour One M3 and their features, directly from the touchscreen. However, its most significant value proposition is support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a>. While hardly a standard feature on Bluetooth audio devices today, it looks to be in the near future.</p><p>When active, it can transmit the signal to any other pair of headphones or earbuds supporting Auracast. You have the option to set up a four-digit passcode to ward off unwanted listeners, but the advantages are pretty numerous.</p><p>For instance, you and a loved one can watch the same content from the same single device wirelessly on a plane, or even utilize the excellent onboard microphones to chat with someone on a video call. Plugging into a TV offers a similar scenario, especially if you each prefer to listen at different volumes.</p><p>The catch remains broader compatibility for Auracast among everyday devices and in public spaces, but it’s something these headphones have over many others for now. It will definitely come in handy when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-and-gn-showcase-auracasts-potential-for-enhanced-hearing-accessibility">Auracast rolls out in more places</a> and on more devices.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jbl-tour-one-m3-what-s-not-good"><span>JBL Tour One M3: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mJQLCXqV8FZCg8wARLZ7z8" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-buttons" alt="View of buttons and controls on JBL Tour One M3 earcups." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mJQLCXqV8FZCg8wARLZ7z8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This isn’t so much a criticism as it is a realization that JBL all but forces you to tinker with the sound profile right away. Your ears may feel different out of the box, though I’d bet that most will feel like something’s missing. Discovering what the Tour One M3 are truly capable of almost feels like unpacking a different pair after the fact.</p><p>That’s a saving grace because it would be a real shame if these, after doing so much right, faltered badly on that front. You may feel like the app is “busy” with all the settings and modes, but trust me, the customization is worth exploring. JBL clearly intends for these expensive cans to be versatile, so you might as well get your money’s worth by making them feel like they’re especially working for you.</p><div><blockquote><p>Despite its usefulness, the Smart Tx transmitter can be a divisive component to all this.</p></blockquote></div><p>That’s why the Smart Tx transmitter can be a divisive component to all this. It’s definitely nifty and cool to use, yet also small and potentially easy to misplace or lose. Additionally, it has its own battery, so you must be mindful of charging it as well. Sadly, it doesn’t have app support or storage, which would be great for storing offline music and keeping your phone away during a workout or run, for instance.</p><p>Auracast may also feel like something you don’t need, but I suspect you will feel differently once you experience it. Even without Auracast enabled, the transmitter is a handy tool to have for those situations. It’s just that you’re paying extra (money and attention) for the convenience.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jbl-tour-one-m3-competition"><span>JBL Tour One M3: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1668px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2bbZo3XvhmiB79ppk4EBtG" name="sony-wh-1000xm6-noise-cancelling-hero" alt="Sony's newest noise-cancelling headphones in silver, black, and blue." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2bbZo3XvhmiB79ppk4EBtG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1668" height="938" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’ll readily admit I didn’t expect the JBL Tour One M3 to be this good.

Samsung skipped the Classic model last year, but it's rumored to be back for the Watch 8 series with a new design and better features. It should offer better battery life than the standard Watch 8, and the interactive bezel should prove useful when using the touchscreen is not an option.</p><p>OnePlus has an equally enticing option for less with the OnePlus Watch 3. It may be more affordable than the Watch 8 Classic, features a rotating crown with haptic feedback, and offers excellent software and impressive battery life.</p><p>If you have to decide between the rumored Galaxy Watch 8 Classic and OnePlus Watch 3, which smartwatch should you pick?

It's built extremely well and feels sturdy when you wear it. The watch case itself weighs almost 50g, so it's not the lightest on your wrist. OnePlus has given it good weather resistance with a 5ATM and IP68 ratings. You get rubber straps by default, but you can easily swap them out for any 22mm strap.</p><p>The display on the Watch 3 is incredible. It features a 1.5-inch LTPO AMOLED display with a 466 x 466 resolution and Sapphire Crystal protection. Brightness levels are also very good, reaching a peak value of up to 2,200 nits. In our review, we found the display to be one of the best aspects of the Watch 3, as it's bright enough for outdoor use and the DC-dimming doesn't create any annoying flickering for PWM-sensitive users. OnePlus has also reduced the thickness of the bezels on this iteration, which makes it nicer to use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8bfw7EPSxQXeXiJzaUP4a9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-5K2-scaled" alt="Two renders of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like, one facing forward-right and the other back-left.

The Watch 8 Classic is expected to come in a single size, and this could be a 46mm or 47mm case. It should have the same AMOLED display size of 1.5 inches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, along with a similar resolution of 480 x 480 pixels. Other expected specs include a brightness of at least 2,000 nits and a 60Hz refresh rate. This isn't wildly different from the OnePlus Watch 3, which means both could be evenly matched when it comes to display quality.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is expected to feature a design similar to the Galaxy Watch Ultra, including the inclusion of a third <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button" target="_blank">Quick Button</a>. Samsung's watch (and phone) designs have started to feel a bit boring lately, so this pivot to a squircle design for the casing could add some freshness and will certainly help set it apart from the crowd. It should have similar durability ratings as the OnePlus Watch 3 as well, with a 5ATM rating when submerged under fresh water and an IP68 rating.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-vs-oneplus-watch-3-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. OnePlus Watch 3: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WGZgTmZNP7HvmmkEasDfyB" name="oneplus-watch-3-bands-detached" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with the watch display on and the bands detached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WGZgTmZNP7HvmmkEasDfyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 costs $349.99 in the U.S., and it often goes on sale for a lower price. There's only one size and variant of the watch at the time of writing, which does not include LTE. Another feature that's present but doesn't work in North America is ECG.</p><p>The Watch 3 has a dual-processor system inside for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> and RTOS. There's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5</a> SoC to handle Google's OS and the BES2800 MCU to power RTOS. This dual functionality is what gives the Watch 3 such amazing battery life. That, and the fact that it has a massive 631mAh battery, allowing it to last a full week on a single charge. This is something the Watch 8 Classic may not be able to keep up with, as even the Watch Ultra has a smaller battery. The Watch 3 is smooth to operate and use thanks to the 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.</p><p>One of the main ways to judge a smartwatch's performance is to gauge the accuracy of all the data it collects. In the case of the Watch 3, Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich was very happy with its performance. In his review, he mentioned that OnePlus has greatly improved the way the watch measures your vitals even when you wear it loosely on your wrist. The results were quite impressive, comparable to those of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>, which is quite notable considering the Watch 3's price.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d2n4bZeTi8fYsotxTahEf9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-5K1-scaled" alt="Three renders of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like in a row, with the Classic facing left, forward, and right, each model showing a circular AMOLED display, rotating metal bezel, orange Action button, and squircle case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d2n4bZeTi8fYsotxTahEf9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / SammyGurus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't know the exact cost of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic yet, but based on the pricing of the Watch 6 Classic, we expect it to be around $450. Samsung is expected to launch Wi-Fi and LTE versions of the Classic, but it will supposedly only come in one size.</p><p>The Watch 8 Classic may continue to use the Exynos W1000 SoC from the Watch 7 series, as Samsung has been known to reuse its chips across multiple generations. We might get a tweaked version of the chip for better efficiency, but we don't expect to see any massive changes. The Watch 8 Classic will probably have 2GB of RAM, along with 32GB of storage.</p><p>As for battery capacity, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is expected to have a 450mAh battery, so slightly larger than the standard Watch 8 (and Watch 7) but much smaller than the OnePlus Watch 3. Charging speeds will once again be either 10W or 15W, so nowhere near as quick as the Watch 3.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus Watch 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>46 x 46.5 x 14.2 mm (46m or 47mm)</p></td><td  ><p>46.6 x 47.6 x 11.75 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.5-inch display, exact specs unknown</p></td><td  ><p>1.5-inch (466x466) LTPO AMOLED, 2,200 nits brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Case Material</p></td><td  ><p>Stainless Steel & Sapphire Crystal, 5ATM water resistance, IP68 & MIL-STD-810H certification</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium bezel, stainless steel case, sapphire crystal glass, MIL-STD-810H, IP68, 5ATM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>49.7g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 SoC, 6nm BES2800 MCU</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM & Storage</p></td><td  ><p>2GB & 32GB</p></td><td  ><p>2GB & 32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Navigation & Physical Controls</p></td><td  ><p>Home, Back & Quick buttons, and Touchscreen</p></td><td  ><p>Digital crown, Back button</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung BioActive Sensor (Optical Heart Rate + Electrical Heart Signal + Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis), Temperature Sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Light Sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Optical HR, SpO2, ECG, wrist temperature, accelerometer, barometer, geomagnetic, gyroscope, light sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi (dual-band), Bluetooth 5.3, LTE (optional), GPS, and NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.2, WiFi 2.4/5GHz, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>450mAh</p></td><td  ><p>631mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 Watch (Wear OS 6)</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 5 and RTOS</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-vs-oneplus-watch-3-software-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. OnePlus Watch 3: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uoJGbHLooC3vBViRDtRqA" name="oneplus-watch-3-green-watchface" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with a green watchface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uoJGbHLooC3vBViRDtRqA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is expected to have the latest One UI 8 Watch, which should be based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>.

If you're not too picky about having LTE or using the ECG function in the U.S., the OnePlus Watch 3 offers incredible value. You get a great-looking watch, good health and fitness monitoring capabilities, a very good interface, and the best battery life you'll find on a watch under $400.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic could be pricier, but it should also offer more features like AI capabilities, longer software support, and a unique design.

After skipping the Classic model with the Watch 7 series, the upcoming Watch 8 Classic is expected to resemble a blend of the standard model and the 2024 Galaxy Watch Ultra, based on leaked renders. This also means it might just compete with the Watch Ultra in terms of battery life and maybe pricing.</p><p>This begs the question: between the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8"> </a>Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra, which smartwatch offers better value?

The rough illustrations show a squircle frame with a circular display, and what looks like three buttons on the right. The Watch Ultra debuted a third <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button">Quick Button</a>, and it appears that the Watch 8 Classic might also receive it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/massive-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leak-all-but-confirms-its-squircle-look" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic render</a>, as seen above, gives us a clearer image of what we might expect the new Classic to look like. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>, which came in two sizes, the Watch 8 Classic is expected to come in a single size, and this could be a 46mm or 47mm case. It's expected to have the same AMOLED display size of 1.5 inches as the Galaxy Watch Ultra, along with a similar resolution of 480 x 480 pixels. Other expected specs include a brightness of at least 2,000 nits and a 60Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The rumored dimensions of the Watch 8 Classic put it at 14.2mm in thickness, which is thicker than the Watch Ultra. Samsung typically doesn't count the width of the sensor underneath, so we hope this 14.2mm measurement includes that as well. If not, the Watch 8 Classic might just end up being one of the thickest smartwatches, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-galaxy-watch-8-classic-design-is-bold-but-i-have-concerns">which can be concerning</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tB2c39Gh7RymoX9CU9kKo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpg" alt="ECG on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tB2c39Gh7RymoX9CU9kKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is large and imposing, weighing 60 grams and measuring 12.1mm in thickness (excluding the sensors). The design is also quite striking, as the case doesn't look like your typical smartwatch. In fact, it bears a striking resemblance to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, another very expensive smartwatch. The titanium frame around the display gives the Galaxy Watch Ultra an added level of durability.</p><p>It also has one of the best displays on any Samsung watch. The Watch Ultra features a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED panel with a 480 x 480 pixel resolution and a maximum brightness of up to 3,000 nits. It comes in three colors: Titanium Silver, Titanium Gray, and Titanium White. It lacks a rotating bezel, which the Watch 8 Classic will most likely have, but you do get a third customizable Quick Button for jumping in and out of activities.</p><p>Besides the usual durability certifications like MIL-STD-810H, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is also rated for 10ATM water resistance, which is double that of most other watches. It's also tested to survive in chlorinated or salty water, which means you can safely go swimming with it in a pool or the ocean.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8bfw7EPSxQXeXiJzaUP4a9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-5K2-scaled" alt="Two renders of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like, one facing forward-right and the other back-left.

This puts it between the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Watch Ultra.</p><p>There is no word on the processor yet, but we believe the Watch 8 Classic may continue to use the Exynos W1000 SoC from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series. This was introduced just last year, and Samsung has been known to reuse its smartwatch chips across multiple generations. We might get a tweaked version of the chip for better efficiency, but I don't think we'll see any massive changes. The Watch 8 Classic will likely have at least 2GB of RAM, along with 32GB of storage.</p><p>As for battery capacity, the Watch 8 Classic is expected to have a 450mAh battery, so slightly larger than the standard Watch 8 (and Watch 7) but smaller than the Watch Ultra. We'll still have either 10W or 15W inductive charging, and the Watch 8 Classic would also most likely not work with the reverse wireless charging feature on Samsung phones due to the redesigned BioActive sensor.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>46 x 46.5 x 14.2 mm (46m or 47mm)</p></td><td  ><p>47.4 x 47.4 x 12.1 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.5-inch display, exact specs unknown</p></td><td  ><p>1.5-inch Super AMOLED, 480x480 pixels resolution</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Case Material</p></td><td  ><p>Stainless Steel & Sapphire Crystal, 5ATM water resistance, IP68 & MIL-STD-810H certification</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium & Sapphire Crystal, 10ATM water resistance, IP68 & MIL-STD-810H certification</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>60.5g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos W1000</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM & Storage</p></td><td  ><p>2GB & 32GB</p></td><td  ><p>2GB & 32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Navigation & Physical Controls</p></td><td  ><p>Home, Back & Quick buttons, and Touchscreen</p></td><td  ><p>Home, Back & Quick buttons, and Touchscreen</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung BioActive Sensor (Optical Heart Rate + Electrical Heart Signal + Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis), Temperature Sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Light Sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung BioActive Sensor (Optical Heart Rate + Electrical Heart Signal + Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis), Temperature Sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Light Sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi (dual-band), Bluetooth 5.3, LTE (optional), GPS, and NFC</p></td><td  ><p>LTE, Bluetooth 5.3, WiFi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, GPS (L1+L5), Glonass, Beidou, Galileo</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>450mAh</p></td><td  ><p>590mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 Watch (Wear OS 6)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 6 Watch (Wear OS 5)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra launched at $649, although Samsung is now officially selling it for roughly $450. That's a significant discount and brings it closer to what the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might ultimately cost. In fact, the LTE version of the Watch 8 Classic may be the same or slightly more expensive than the Ultra when it launches. This would really make you think doubly hard before picking one.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is powered by the Exynos W1000 SoC, and it has 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Health and fitness tracking performance was very good, although GPS positioning wasn't as accurate as a Garmin watch. Overall, we found the fitness hardware to be much stronger compared to previous generations when we reviewed it.</p><p>The Watch Ultra is the best Samsung watch for those who require the ultimate battery life. Samsung promises 60 hours with the always-on display enabled, and this is something we managed to achieve in our testing. Charging is not the fastest, as in our experience, it typically takes about two hours to fully charge the watch from an empty battery.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-software-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG reading on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will most likely come with the latest One UI 8 Watch, which should be based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>.

Some of these features would include a new metric called "vascular load," which monitors your daily cardiovascular system and provides alerts if you're engaging in excessive activity. The Health app will also feature a "personal health coach" that provides tips on weight loss, helps you achieve your sleep goals, and updates you on your overall health progress.</p><p>Along with these new features, we should also see the same or tweaked BioActive sensor for heart rate, ECG, SpO2, and skin temperature tracking, carried forward from the Galaxy Watch Ultra. The redesigned BioActive sensor from last year's models allowed the Watch Ultra to monitor a new metric called AGEs Index, but this was just one of "many new advanced features" that were planned.</p><p>This means we could see some new health metrics being added to the Watch 8 Classic, which should eventually come to the Watch Ultra in the next big software update.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-which-one-is-better-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Which one is better?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d2n4bZeTi8fYsotxTahEf9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-5K1-scaled" alt="Three renders of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like in a row, with the Classic facing left, forward, and right, each model showing a circular AMOLED display, rotating metal bezel, orange Action button, and squircle case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d2n4bZeTi8fYsotxTahEf9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / SammyGurus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has yet to be officially launched, but based on what we know so far, it appears to be a solid middle ground between the Watch 8 and the Watch Ultra. The rotating bezel would be a significant incentive for purchasing this model, as it makes navigating menus and features more seamless, especially when the touchscreen is unavailable. The mix of a squircle watch frame with the circular display actually looks kind of cool, if the Classic ends up looking like the leaked renders.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra will still have its niche fans, and those who need the extra ruggedness won't mind spending a premium for it. For most people, though, the Watch 8 Classic would be a better choice and would be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung watches</a> to buy.

I'm using the 16GB/512GB configuration, and I think this hits the sweet spot both with pricing and storage.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 10S Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.85-inch 144Hz AMOLED, 2688x1216, 2,000 nits max, Gorilla Glass 7i</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Redmagic OS 10.5 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Leading Version, Adreno 830, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB/24GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.9, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.0 wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>16MP f/2.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP54 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, 24-bit/192kHz, Snapdragon Sound, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,050mAh silicon battery, 80W charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.4 x 76.1 x 8.9mm, 229g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Silver, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-10s-pro-design"><span>Redmagic 10S Pro: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2A3HpHEwBsjssLuLzMdpLQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2A3HpHEwBsjssLuLzMdpLQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">You may like: </div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra review<br></a>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13 review</a></p></div></div><p>I like gaming phones because they're flamboyant, and the 10S Pro is no different. Redmagic had its share of ostentatious designs in the past, but I like how clean the 10S Pro looks; the see-through aesthetic isn't as bold as Nothing's devices, but it still allows the 10S Pro to stand out visually.</p><p>Like the best gaming phones, the 10S Pro gets RGB lighting at the back. There are two lighting zones — a stylized X next to the camera island and Redmagic logo at the bottom — and you can easily customize the colors. The white model I'm using looks fabulous, and a key design differentiator is the fully flat back — there's no visible camera protrusion.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="dxr7ddyFQAumHQvLtykuLQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxr7ddyFQAumHQvLtykuLQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5154" height="2903" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zk2bbZNTqehAfXAmnasyLQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zk2bbZNTqehAfXAmnasyLQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4921px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b5eYfAPsruAhpuJc4MTFLQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5eYfAPsruAhpuJc4MTFLQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4921" height="2772" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google got plenty of praise with the Pixel 9a because of a similar design decision, and Redmagic did just as well with the 10S Pro; if anything, the Chinese brand deserves more credit as it's using a larger sensor at the back. I've gotten so used to phones with oversized camera modules that it's a refreshing change of pace to go back that doesn't protrude, and I like what Redmagic did with the overall design.</p><p>A side-effect of the design is that the 10S Pro slides off any surface that isn't flat; it took nearly a dozen tumbles from the couch in the 10 days I used it, which in itself is a new record. Annoyingly, one of those tumbles led to a microfracture at the edge of the panel, and the 10S Pro joins the unwelcome list of phones that broke during routine use — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra</a> is the only other device that did so in the last seven years.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="G648FfhWfsFdQUECmrLR7Q" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G648FfhWfsFdQUECmrLR7Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of this is to say that if you're eyeing this phone, I'd suggest using it with a case. While I like the design, it clearly isn't as durable as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> or any of the other Chinese flagships I used this year, and it is quite blocky and unforgiving; you don't get much bevels on the sides, so it digs into your palm. The phone gets Gorilla Glass 7i covering the panel and Gorilla Glass 5 at the back.</p><p>Also, Redmagic went overboard with the buttons; there are just too many on the right, and the brand should have moved the volume rocker to the left. As it stands, it's hard to access the power button as it sits too low on the side. Then there's the gaming toggle; it's located just where you'd position the phone on a car mount, and it constantly triggered gaming mode while I was navigating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zk2bbZNTqehAfXAmnasyLQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zk2bbZNTqehAfXAmnasyLQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 10S Pro has a built-in fan at the back, and there are vents that serve as the intake and exhaust. This isn't just a gimmick either; I tested the exhaust via a Fluke thermal camera, and it makes a difference in extended gaming sessions. Because of the vents, the 10S Pro is limited to IP54 ingress protection, and you miss out on IP68. The plus side is that the 3.5mm jack is intact.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-10s-pro-screen"><span>Redmagic 10S Pro: Screen</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fibo7LsrkVsutcS4gSaZdQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fibo7LsrkVsutcS4gSaZdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A clear advantage to using the 10S Pro is that you don't get a cutout at the front; the phone has a selfie camera hidden beneath the panel, and unless you're using it outdoors, you can't even make it out. This is a big deal while gaming and watching multimedia, and I like what Redmagic did in this area.</p><p>It nailed the rest of the details as well: the device gets a good AMOLED panel with 144Hz refresh, and it has all the gaming extras you need. Demanding games go up to 120fps, and the phone is an absolute joy to use. A lot of that has to do with the fluidity; it is one of the fastest phones I've used yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ye4MEMaVYZaAYMj4sfwbSQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ye4MEMaVYZaAYMj4sfwbSQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to the 3.5mm jack, you can easily plug in IEMs if that's your preferred choice of audio gear.

So if you like playing shooters, the triggers are a good way to gain an advantage. I didn't see any issues in extended gaming sessions either; the phone tends to run hot, but that is the case with all 2025 devices featuring Qualcomm silicon, and after 30 minutes of gaming, it didn't exceed 48 degrees.</p><p>Weirdly enough, I had problems with connectivity. Internet was rock-solid on my home network, but every time I switched over to cellular data, it just wouldn't load sites even though it showed a strong signal. I'm using the U.S. variant of the device, and even though it has the requisite 5G bands, it still didn't connect reliably. I'm attributing this to my unit and not the device in general, but it's an annoying bug nonetheless.</p><p>The phone has a huge 7,050mAh silicon-carbon battery, and even with heavy use, it lasted a day and a half. Most of the time, you'll only need to charge the 10S Pro every two days on average, and when you need to plug it in, there's 80W charging.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-10s-pro-cameras"><span>Redmagic 10S Pro: Cameras</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="bP43aiuaVQnPgoZsnkoKqP" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bP43aiuaVQnPgoZsnkoKqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 10S Pro comes with a 50MP main camera and a 50MP wide-angle lens, and it's clear that the cameras are an afterthought on this device.

It is fluid, doesn't have any issues in regular use, and while you don't get as much customizability as other brands, the basics are covered.</p><p>It's ironic that you'll need to buy a gaming phone to get a clean software with good optimization.

ASUS went with a mainstream design this year, so the phone doesn't stand out quite as much as the 10S Pro. That said, it is just as fast, and the AMOLED panel is fabulous. The only annoyance is ASUS' inability to deliver more than two software updates; that intentionally hobbles what is one of the best hardware packages.</p><p>If you don't want an overt gaming phone, the iQOO 13 is my recommendation.

It is much better than its predecessors, and the design is a standout — both at the front and back. The flat back is great to use, and active cooling ensures it doesn't overheat. While this is a giant slab of a phone, it doesn't have the same durability as other devices, and you'll need to use a case at the least.</p><p>The cameras aren't that great either; while you get decent shots, they don't measure up to true flagships.

This exclusive AI assistant feature is allegedly still inbound for the Pixel 10 series. The tipster offered a look at what Google could provide Pixel 10 users when setting up Magic Cue.

That piece of software was called "Pixie" at the start and was stated to be "smarter" and "more personal" than the old Assistant (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">which Gemini is kicking out</a>). Google's plans have remained consistent, with those 2023 rumors stating Pixie would leverage your data from Maps, Gmail, and whatever else you've given it access to.</p><p>However, this exclusive Pixel assistant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-to-debut-with-ai-powered-pixie">underwent a name change</a> back in March. A few months ago, we were reportedly calling the AI "Pixel Sense." During that report, more information about the AI came to light, like its ability to process "media files, including text, images, AI-generated content, and associated metadata." For example, if Pixel Sense is active and you take a screenshot, the AI will catalog it internally to help you later on if you're looking for it again.</p><p>There's been some privacy and security concerns, especially considering how involved Pixie or Pixel Sense, or Magic Cue will be with what you're doing. Like the screenshots above, sources claim the data the AI obtains will remain private and "visible only to you, not even Google can see it."</p><p>We're still yet to see exactly how Magic Cue works on a Pixel, but we won't have to wait much longer if it's headed for the Pixel 10.

Moreover, we're seeing the Adreno 840 GPU rumor once again, two months later.</p><p>While DCS claims the chip's "second-generation" Oryon CPU cores are putting in overtime in its latest test, there were rumors that Qualcomm could bring "enhanced Pegasus" cores to the 8 Elite 2.</p><p>Pricing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-successor-price-rumors">could be a concern</a>, like it was with the first model, but there's also Qualcomm's potential core architecture. The first Snapdragon 8 Elite launched with two Prime cores and six performance cores. We'll have to wait and see if Qualcomm keeps things similar or not.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Samsung, Google, and other major players in the Android smartphone space <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24" target="_blank">haven't yet fulfilled our dreams</a>, accessory makers have stepped in to bridge the gap. So, while we wait for Qi2 to enter the mainstream, you can enjoy all of the best magnetic accessories with a MagSafe adapter.</p><p>With a good magnetic ring from trusted brands like ESR or Spigen, you can make almost any MagSafe accessory work with your Android phone. Whether you're using a premium device like the S25 Ultra or a more affordable Pixel 9a, if you want it to stick, just pop a ring on the back.</p><p>There are so many amazing MagSafe add-ons available. Items such as wallets, grips, stands, and mounts can be used without a second thought. Be cautious when using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads" target="_blank">wireless chargers</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-qi-wireless-charging-power-banks" target="_blank">wireless portable chargers</a>, as most of them are designed for iPhones and do not support Android's wireless charging protocols.</p><p>We love the PopSockets Phone Grip with MagSafe Adapter Ring because it comes with an Adapter Ring in the box. There are loads of amazing colors and designs available; we love to see them! And, of course, the tops are swappable with any other PopSockets PopGrip top.</p><p>For Qi2 wireless charging, we recommend the ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger. If you want something to power up your phone on the go, the Mophie Snap+ Juice Pack Mini is an excellent choice for Android users. Mophie includes magnetic rings called Snap adapters with both products, which saves you the time, effort, and money to buy one separately.</p><p>MagSafe kickstands and wallets are everywhere these days. ESR's HaloLock 5,000mAh Power Bank Wallet stands out by doubling as a kickstand and portable charger. And if you're feeling bold, you can even attach Apple's MagSafe leather wallet to your S25 Ultra or Pixel 9!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The main highlight here is what's being suggested for the base Galaxy Watch 8 model: a squircle design.

The publication notes that they were able to access "credible marketing materials intended for retailers," which points to Google working on a range of these Qi2 accessories.</p><p>The tech giant appears to be referring to this group of accessories as "Pixelsnap" and could end up resembling Apple's MagSafe charging systems. The publication further states that there are supposedly three accessories in the works: a Pixelsnap charger, a Pixelsnap charger with a stand, and a Pixelsnap Ring Stand.</p><p>What these accessories would look like remains a mystery; however, there are speculations that the “Pixelsnap Charger” is likely a basic wireless charger, much like the Apple's MagSafe, the “Pixelsnap Charger with Stand” could be an accessory that keeps the phone upright, allowing you to use your phone while its charging, assuming it could look a little like the Pixel stand with Qi2 compatibility.</p><p>As for the "Pixelsnap Ring stand," it could be a ring-like charging accessory that could function as a stand as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZHSd6tWu83Dm7Xr44ZPah6" name="Pixelsnap-Qi2-charging" alt="Evidence for the new Pixelsnap charger in a trade database" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZHSd6tWu83Dm7Xr44ZPah6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The website further notes that they were able to spot direct references to the Pixelsnap accessories on a trade database. The entries in the database suggest that Google's Qi 2.2 chargers may be in the works.</p><p>Certain terms within the database, like "STN4," could be the codename for the charger, while "MPP" stands for Magnetic Power Profile on a wireless charger, and as for the charging speed, the publication indicates that ike  “ConvenientPower CPS4041,” indicate the support for up to 60W charging, which allegedly is a presence of a chip that allows for up to 60W charging.</p><p>The website also appears to have spotted hints at potential Pixel 10 colorways, such as “Rock Candy” and “Mist,” as well as black and Porcelain colorways, as seen in the screenshot above.</p><h2 id="more-evidence-of-qi2-on-pixel-10-2">More evidence of Qi2 on Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pUzmDQ5w4SXsb8AywoheAm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-on-pixel-stand-v2.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold on Pixel Stand V2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pUzmDQ5w4SXsb8AywoheAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-charger">post</a>, Android Headlines seems to have gotten more information on these alleged accessories. The website claims that the Qi2 charger will "look a whole lot like Apple’s own MagSafe charger. While the stand will look like the current Pixel Stand 2, with a slot to slide in the Qi2 charger."</p><p>That said, Android Headlines notes that you can only charge the Pixel 10 series wirelessly if you have a case that supports Qi2 and that Google will be making its cases Qi2 compatible. This means the Pixel 10 series might not show up with the magnets on its rear panel, and cannot be charged wirelessly on its own.</p><p>Additionally, it states that Google could also sell several Qi2 accessories from the “Made for Google” program to casemakers like Belkin, Bellroy, Spigen, and others, allowing users to choose from a wide range of products. Lastly, the website adds that Google could also be working on a dual-port USB-C charger that supports 45W charging speeds.</p><p>It remains unclear whether users can charge only their phones or other Google products, such as Pixel Buds and the Pixel Watch, with the Pixelsnap accessories. While these are still rumors, we expect to get more information on the Pixel 10 series' charging capabilities closer to launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Starting at $819.99, the Boox Tab X C is available for purchase starting today. It’s a thin and light tablet measuring just 5.3mm thick, all while offering Android 13 support and an E-ink color display.</p><p>The tablet is a new refresh of the Boox Tab X, a black-and-white E-ink tablet with Android 11 and a thicker build. By comparison, the Boox Tab X C is thinner, runs a new version of Android, and adds the color E-ink screen. The Onyx Boox Tab X C could be for the person who wants an E-ink tablet or reading device without compromise. With support for Android and Google Play Store apps, as well as a color screen, the Onyx Boox can do almost everything a traditional Android tablet could.</p><p>For specs, the tablet has a 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display that’s about the size of A4 paper. This means you could use it for reading, looking at documents and PDFs, or taking notes without dealing with wonky aspect ratios. It features 150 pixels-per-inch (ppi) when using color, which is upped to 300ppi when in black-and-white mode.</p><p>The company says the Boox Tab X C is built with “an advanced octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM, and exclusive BSR technology” that adds up to deliver “exceptional multitasking capabilities.” It comes with an upgraded InkSpire stylus for note-taking and annotating, and you get a free magnetic case when buying from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/tabxc" target="_blank">Boox store</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JXgfAM9zfbWXog3tRwevnc" name="onyx-boox-tab-x-lifestyle-5.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Tab X E Ink tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JXgfAM9zfbWXog3tRwevnc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Onyx Boox Tab X E-ink tablet.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Priced at over $800, the Boox Tab X C is in the same category as top iPad, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab">Samsung Galaxy Tab</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad</a> models. That could make it a tough sell, as you’re getting an Android version that’s three years out-of-date and less processing power. Still, it’s important to remember what the Boox Tab X C is and who it’s designed for.</p><p>This is for fans of E-ink readers and tablets who want the performance and openness of Android, all in a compact package. They can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/e-ink-phones-are-amazing-but-you-might-want-to-keep-a-camera-nearby">easier on the eyes</a> and feel more natural compared to LCD or OLED tablets.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It is also a sizable 3.6GB update that is also bringing the June 2025 security patch.</p><p>Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-beta-could-show-up-on-older-galaxy-devices-this-month">previous leaks</a>, the One UI 8 beta should also be hitting older Galaxy models. While it is currently limited to the flagship trio, we should be seeing it on devices like the Galaxy S24 series and the Galaxy S23 series. The former is expected to see the firmware by the end of June or early July. On the latter, it could arrive by mid-July.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

VR gamers, it seems, simply aren't entitled to the same quality gaming experiences because there's not enough of them to matter.</p><p>We saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/fans-complain-about-batman-arkham-shadow">this same kind of nonsense reaction</a> when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> was announced, and loud, terminally online gamers didn't let the facts get in the way of their tired arguments then either. That argument goes something like this: "Real gamers" don't play VR games, and developers shouldn't be making serious VR games because they're a "slap in the face" of fans who want the same old games in a shiny new package.</p><p>Unfortunately, for them, the reality is that these VR-exclusive games wouldn't exist <em>at all </em>without VR developers looking for a way to get more gamers into VR, and no amount of whining is going to get Ubisoft, WB, or another giant publisher to remake that 20-year-old game you once loved.</p><h2 id="the-economy-of-vr-gaming-2">The economy of VR gaming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZQbjLTNUaUE44Bumq4kdTH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-mojoworld" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the character Mojo and two bodyguards standing in a casino-like room, with Mojo flipping an M-labeled gold coin to Deadpool." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZQbjLTNUaUE44Bumq4kdTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>VR games are their own medium, separate from the economy of traditional or even mobile games. You can think of these a bit like paintings, where artists might choose watercolors, oils, or acrylics. The right canvas has to be chosen for these paints to work correctly, and they often don't mix very well.</p><p>Because of that, funding for VR games is often separate from funding for traditional games. This is made even more complicated by companies like Sony and Meta, who often fund VR titles behind the scenes, even if they're not the ones publishing them. PSVR 2-exclusive VR modes like those in Resident Evil 7 and 8, for instance, were funded partially by Sony, which is why you don't see them on other systems.</p><p>Many titles funded by Meta end up as multiplatform VR games, but some remain as Meta Quest exclusives. Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-publishing-announcement">has funded hundreds of VR games</a> over the last decade and continues to help support the development and publication of these games. Guess what that means? Without VR-specific funding, these games would never exist.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mAKH2oeLeJ6drmf5mRaPWH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-sword-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool holding a sword and throwing knife as two ninja-like foes charge towards the player." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mAKH2oeLeJ6drmf5mRaPWH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Embracer Group, the parent company of Vertigo Games and owner of the Thief IP, had no interest in making a new traditional Thief game. WB likely had no interest in making another traditional Batman Arkham game. If they did, the most recent releases for these franchises wouldn't have been a decade ago.</p><p>The new VR releases of these titles were made possible because companies like Meta approached the owners of these IPs and paid for the opportunity to resurrect a favorite series in a new way. In other words, this is the biggest fan service you could possibly get, as it not only brings back fan-favorite titles but also helps bring them to a modern gaming world with a unique perspective.</p><div><blockquote><p>Without VR-specific funding, these games would never exist.</p></blockquote></div><p>Likewise, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metro-awakening-review">Metro Awakening</a> wasn't developed <em>instead</em> of a traditional mainline entry into the Metro series. Maze Theory, a VR-only developer, is developing it, while Vertigo Games, the same company that's making Thief VR, is publishing it.</p><p>The developers of the mainline Metro series, 4A Games, have been busy making the next mainline Metro game while simultaneously dealing with the Ukraine War since 2022. If you didn't know, 4A Games was founded in Kyiv, and the invasion of Russia is said to have made the next Metro game<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.as.com/meristation/news/next-metro-game-will-be-even-darker-after-ukraine-invasion-war-has-changed-the-saga-n/#:~:text=4A%20Games%20talks%20about%20its,conflicts%20of%20the%20last%20decade.&text=The%20next%20title%20in%20the,shapes%20the%20games%20we%20make.%E2%80%9D"> "even darker"</a> than previous installments. Don't worry, Metro fans, you can have your cake and eat it, too.</p><p>But all of these facts seem to fall on deaf ears when it comes to "fans" and their favorite series. Instead of embracing something new and different — even if that difference just means a change of perspective — some gamers seem to be entirely allergic to having fun if that definition of fun doesn't fit a very narrow window.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nCTLMRPosJfjiUM3m8QzYC" name="thief-vr-screenshot-sneaking" alt="A screenshot of Thief VR on Meta Quest 3 showing you sneaking up behind a guard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCTLMRPosJfjiUM3m8QzYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vertigo Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a strange sense of irony here, too, given that plenty of gamers complain about new releases feeling the same as old releases, or that the industry has become too reliant on HD remakes of classic games.</p><p>Playing something new and different is exciting, and being able to actually <em>do</em> things is what separates VR games from traditional games played on a flat screen. You're the one grabbing the rope, throwing the knife, or landing the punch, not the automated avatar on a distant display.</p><p>Publishers are trusting VR developers with more big-name titles than ever, and it's a direct representation of both the quality of VR games and an audience willing to try something fun and new. These games aren't made by the studios that made the 10-year-old entry into your favorite series. They're made bespoke for a new medium with different paradigms, from new developers with an affinity for that medium, and that's a really cool thing to be a part of.</p><h2 id="forever-a-niche-2">Forever a niche?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6vJjYNuAaPcUcJV27RVrZC" name="teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-empire-city-screenshot-splinter" alt="A screenshot of TMNT Empire City on the Meta Quest 3 showing Splinter meditating in a sewer lair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6vJjYNuAaPcUcJV27RVrZC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Cortopia Studios)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest arguments against any kind of "big name" VR game is that the medium is too niche for high-caliber titles. Based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/essential-facts-about-the-us-video-game-industry/2025-data/">a report by the Entertainment Software Association</a>, VR makes up 10% of the total player base of 195.7 million gamers. While 10% falls squarely in the definition of the word niche, the number of folks using VR headsets regularly feels anything but niche.</p><p>At just under 20 million active players and primarily made up of Millennials and younger generations, VR has the attention of the next generation of gamers. This is a great thing, for the most part, as it ensures that people who play VR now are still early in their gaming careers, while older gamers tend to enjoy gaming for the purposes of passing the time or relaxation.</p><p>If I had to define VR gaming in any single way, it would be the opposite of "relaxation." Most VR games are quite active and require you to move your body, which is probably one of the reasons VR usage is lower among older age groups.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wZidDF5vMNtBjuWVioEpVc" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hero.jpg" alt="Putting on a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wZidDF5vMNtBjuWVioEpVc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ironically, playing games "to have fun" is inversely proportional in the ESA's report, with younger gamers opting to choose this as their foremost reason for gaming, while older gamers are significantly less interested. Maybe this fits well with what I said earlier about some gamers being allergic to having fun?</p><p>Better yet for VR, "immersion and escape" was listed as the fourth-largest reason people love to play games, and the statistics here were fairly even across age groups. It's nearly impossible to get any more immersive than VR, which suggests that there's more than enough genuine interest to continue driving the medium forward.</p><p>To make things <em>even</em> better, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-quest-4-might-slip-to-2027-but-meta-could-unveil-a-lighter-model-next-year-instead">Meta is said to be working on</a> a sort of VR/smart glasses hybrid device that'll provide gamers with a substantially lighter headset than the current ones available. This device may launch as early as next year, opening up new pathways for gamers who have opted out of VR because of the size or weight of existing headsets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G7dMDa2H58q7EdAXKMwwQP" name="Batman-arkham-shadow-group-therapy-still.jpeg" alt="Screenshot from Batman: Arkham Shadow showing Harleen Quinzel and a group therapy session at Arkham." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G7dMDa2H58q7EdAXKMwwQP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regardless of the reason, though, I'd love to encourage the nay-sayers to give these games a try.

The original Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds were a hit, and the company is improving on that initial success by adding wireless charging, improved ANC, and more at a $299 price point. An all-new portable speaker, the SoundLink Plus Portable, is coming alongside a second-generation SoundLink Micro speaker as well.</p><p>Of course, AI is at the heart of the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds upgrades. There are new AI algorithms being used to identify and cancel out bursts of noise when active noise-canceling is enabled. This builds upon Bose's existing ActiveSense ANC mode, and coincides with better call quality and voice recognition, according to the company.</p><p>The earbuds include a tweaked design and a bright colorway, Deep Plum, that joins Black and White Smoke. A clever trick Bose is introducing with the second-gen QuietComfort Ultra earbuds is the earwax guard, which is built into the earbuds to prevent earwax buildup.</p><p>The second-generation QuietComfort Ultra earbuds now feature wireless charging and will last for a total of six hours with ANC enabled. This solves a strange quirk with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-review">the first-generation model</a>, which needed a separate sleeve to charge wirelessly.

It's sure to be a hip option with bright and vibrant colorways including Citrus Yellow. Pre-orders are available starting now.</p><p>There's also a new model of the Bose SoundLink Micro speaker, which is a more compact offering. It has USB-C charging, a 12-hour battery life, and will launch in the coming months for $129 in blue or black colorways.</p><p>The surprise audio refresh from Bose means that some of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">our favorite wireless audio products</a> are getting better just in time for summer.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now we have our answer: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1510465/">Garmin Venu X1</a>, a premium squircle fitness watch with a 2-inch AMOLED and an insanely skinny design: Just 8mm, 6.4mm thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.</p><p>Garmin clearly designed the Venu X1 with Apple's flagship as a foil, with a slightly bigger display, the same $799 launch price, and an eight-day battery life. It hits 448 x 486 resolution, compared to Apple's 502 x 410 resolution, with a slightly more noticeable border along the top and bottom.</p><p>Similarities aside, the Garmin Venu X1 and Apple Watch Ultra are very different devices, as Garmin can't offer the same apps, computing power, phone integration, or full titanium casing.</p><p>Regardless, Garmin evidently hopes to steal away Apple customers who fell in love with the titanium design but care more about premium <em>fitness</em> and comfort than top-tier performance.</p><h2 id="the-venu-x1-gets-almost-everything-held-back-from-the-venu-3-2">The Venu X1 gets almost everything held back from the Venu 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7055px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="jRyHoQdSsC4L4fhLpfkAFd" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-daily-readiness" alt="Photo of the Garmin Venu X1 on an athlete's wrist showing his daily readiness score (High)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jRyHoQdSsC4L4fhLpfkAFd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7055" height="3969" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Venu X1 offers a superior fitness experience to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a>, which is more of an all-rounder that lacks key training tools like Training Readiness.</p><p>For runners, the Garmin Venu X1 adds Training Status / Load / Effect, Lactate Threshold, Performance Condition, Daily Suggested Workouts, a Race Glance widget, real-time stamina, heat acclimation, multisport activities, Strava Live Segments, Hill / Endurance scores, and dozens of new sports modes.</p><p>And for hikers, the Venu X1 gets predownloaded topo maps that should look <em>fantastic</em> on a 2-inch display and make buyers of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Garmin Instinct 3</a> insanely jealous. You also get 43,000 golf courses and a handful of relevant tools like the Virtual Caddie.</p><p>On the smarts front, the Garmin Venu X1 brings back the same mic & speaker, but they now go beyond passthrough voice commands to support Voice Memos and on-device voice commands.

The Venu X1 only lasts eight days or 14 all-systems GNSS, with no multi-band option.</p><p>But many runners might prefer the Venu X1, simply because it weighs 16g less with the nylon band (40g vs. 56g) and measures 4.9mm thinner. Garmin prioritized skinniness and comfort while still offering a week of battery life, and its second-tier GPS accuracy is still as good as some rivals' best.</p><p>Most importantly, the Garmin Venu X1 gives athletes a larger space for more glanceable information and more complications on the watch face.</p><h2 id="the-garmin-venu-x1-design-will-thrill-some-and-turn-off-others-2">The Garmin Venu X1 design will thrill some and turn off others</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7069px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kJDBThdtWW3RydBE6fLpud" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-weightlifting" alt="Photo of the Garmin Venu X1 on a weightlifter's wrist as they work out" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJDBThdtWW3RydBE6fLpud.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7069" height="3976" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> fans will prefer a circular design, particularly the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> with uncompromised battery life and a fully titanium case — while the Venu X1 mixes lighter polymer with a titanium caseback.</p><p>Basically, there's no way for the Venu X1 to blend in as a "normal" watch.</p><p>But those who liked the skinny <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch X</a> will salivate over this design.

Here’s the statement by Google shared with the publication further explaining the situation:</p><p>“A subset of Pixel 6a phones will require a mandatory software update to reduce the risk of potential battery overheating. The update will enable battery management features that will reduce capacity and charging performance after the battery reaches 400 charge cycles. We’ll contact impacted customers next month with all the information they need to address the issue.”</p><p>Earlier, the company released the Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2, and the code is said to have disclosed the update first.

The company reinforced the need for hardware, software, and AI to work together to provide top-notch mobile camera experiences in 2025, as it wrote in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/your-smartphone-camera-now-gets-what-youre-looking-at-and-responds" target="_blank">blog post</a>. Specifically, Samsung previewed an intelligent camera system that can understand what you’re shooting and adjust on the fly to match any situation.<br><br>“As AI evolves from text-based prompts to multimodal understanding, Galaxy devices are becoming smarter — able to get what you’re looking at and respond to situations. The camera is at the heart of this transformation,” the company explained. “More than just a tool for capturing images, coupled with enhanced AI-powered features, the Galaxy camera is now part of the intuitive interface that turns what users see into understanding and action.”</p><p>We’ve already seen intelligent software use mobile cameras for object recognition and context awareness. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series was one of the first to get Gemini Live’s multimodal video streaming capabilities.

This listing highlights Honor's continued progress with the device, as it achieves its necessary certification; however, this comes with a sneak peek at another supposed upgrade. The publication discovered a listing that specified the two chargers for the two Magic V5 variants.</p><p>According to the database, both chargers kick their strength up a notch to 80W charging capabilities.</p><p>Things get a little interesting here, as the publication calls out one of these 80W chargers with model number HN-200400C00. It states that this charger was provided alongside the Honor Power from April; however, consumers only received 66W charging capabilities with the phone. There's speculation that Honor could, in essence, let this charger go "uncapped" to reach its full potential on its Magic V5.</p><p>Elsewhere, the publication noticed Honor listings for two Magic V5, which is a little odd. The post believes these devices to be the same and not two different models with wildly differing specs.</p><h2 id="battery-life-is-the-focus-2">Battery Life is the focus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mGDWJXuMUEtDbgqqRdBJp4" name="Honor 400" alt="Honor 400 back view against blue and red background with Honor logo highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mGDWJXuMUEtDbgqqRdBJp4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we await Honor's alleged summer timeline launch for the Magic V5, another rumor from May detailed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honors-next-foldable-phone-could-arrive-with-a-beastly-battery-upgrade">potential battery upgrade</a>. The Chinese OEM's foldable reportedly appeared in the MIIT and 3C Certification databases earlier this year, which detailed a monster 6,000mAh battery. Since it's a foldable, the device features a dual-cell design: 2,070mAh and 3,880mAh.</p><p>While this <em>actually </em>adds up to 5,950mAh, Honor will most likely round that up to 6,000mAh during its promotional and market run. More importantly, this is a notable battery increase from the Magic V3's 5,150mAh battery. Users should see even more life out of their device when scrolling and watching videos. Moreover, if this charger upgrade happens as speculated, that could get you back in the game even faster.</p><p>Another unspecified aspect of the Magic V5 is whether or not Honor will slim it down further. The Magic V3 was already 9.2mm when folded, and we all know how thin phones have become all the rage recently.</p><p>While we mull things over, Honor is rumored to launch the Magic V5 at some point in July.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

After years of hoping Google would follow in Samsung’s footsteps, it has done just that, as we have a proper desktop mode on Pixel phones</p><p>After spending some time with it, I have a few thoughts, but before I continue, I need to remind everyone that this is part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/connected-displays-android-16s-game-changing-multitasking-feature">Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2</a>. Just keep that in mind if you venture down this path yourself, as you’re likely to run into a few bugs along the way.</p><h2 id="getting-started-2">Getting started</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="YQWCysLMZ4ybjTsHaMsoFB" name="Developer Options to enable Desktop Mode in Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2" alt="Developer Options to enable Desktop Mode in Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YQWCysLMZ4ybjTsHaMsoFB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you install QPR1 Beta 2 and just plug your Pixel into an external display, you either won’t see anything or will just see your phone screen mirrored. That’s because Google’s not ready to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16s-desktop-mode-was-right-in-front-of-us-the-entire-time">desktop mode</a> accessible to everyone right out of the box. After all, this is a Developer Preview, and not the public build.</p><p>Thankfully, it’s pretty easy to enable desktop mode, as you just need to enable Developer Options, toggle the “Enable desktop experience features,” then reboot your phone. Now, when you try plugging in your Pixel to an external display, it <em>should</em> show a desktop-like interface.</p><h2 id="a-good-start-with-room-for-improvement-2">A good start with room for improvement</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="i9s7WdBF5aUym7mW2ggMHB" name="Desktop Mode App Drawer on Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2" alt="Desktop Mode App Drawer on Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i9s7WdBF5aUym7mW2ggMHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the most part, it looks exactly like I expected it to, which is pretty similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>. Again, it doesn’t come as a surprise, considering that Google asked Samsung for some help in the design and implementation.</p><p>The Dock matches up with whatever you previously added on your phone, with the exception of a few things. On the far left is an app drawer; any apps that you have open will appear to the right of the Dock, and on the far right are your standard navigation controls. However, you can still use some gestures if you have a trackpad paired to your phone, or something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/nexdock-wireless-review">NexDock</a>.</p><p>I was a bit concerned about how smoothly it would be to move different app windows around. Thankfully, it’s been about as good as I could have hoped for, which was honestly a relief, as I was a bit worried about some jankiness.</p><div><blockquote><p>It's not perfect, but Google got a lot of things right with desktop mode, to the point that I'm already comfortable using it regularly. </p></blockquote></div><p>There are a few other features packed into desktop mode that I wasn’t expecting, such as the ability to snap app windows to the left or right side just by dragging the window to one side or the other. There’s even a preview menu that appears when I hover my cursor over the “window control” button in the top right corner. You’re limited to just two options (full-screen or split-screen), but it’s still helpful to have.</p><p>At the same time as all of that, there’s still definitely room for improvement. Some of the more bothersome issues are likely just nitpicks and can/will be addressed with future updates.</p><p>One of the more annoying things is the toolbar that appears whenever your cursor is in a text field, above the Dock that you just can’t get rid of. There’s no way to hide it, and it sits on top of any other window, which just drives me nuts.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="26xriGHSJPku58UAvHngKB" name="Text insertion toolbar attached to dock on the bottom" alt="Text insertion toolbar attached to dock on the bottom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/26xriGHSJPku58UAvHngKB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zARMtkQqh4eDSW7y4mEiHB" name="Text insertion toolbar settings pop-up" alt="Text insertion toolbar settings pop-up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zARMtkQqh4eDSW7y4mEiHB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="55euehe6vF46ZLizXLeWFB" name="Text insertion toolbar minimized and snapped to the right" alt="Text insertion toolbar minimized and snapped to the right" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/55euehe6vF46ZLizXLeWFB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The only way I’ve been able to mitigate the frustration is by turning it into a vertical bar, which moves it to the left of the screen.

For one, buyers love the inclusion of the Samsung S Pen, the powerful and smooth performance, and the huge 14.6-inch AMOLED display. Performance on the device is backed by 12GB of RAM and a MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus CPU, and users will barely notice the company's switch away from the well-regarded Qualcomm lineup.</p><p>Available in either moonstone gray or platinum silver, this deal is for the 256GB configuration of the S10 Ultra, though you can also upgrade to 512GB or 1TB of storage.</p><p>It is worth noting that the S10 Ultra doesn't offer cellular connectivity in the United States, and it's still fairly expensive at $1,000. Still, if you were already in the market for a large, premium tablet, you can't really go wrong with paying $200 less than usual.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While certain devices from Fossil, Montblanc, and Mobvoi were <em>technically </em>"supported" on Apple's iPhones via Wear OS by Google, that option's gone out the window. Curiously, in 2024, there were some limitations highlighted about trying to bridge the gap between Android and iOS software. This primarily concerned consistent connectivity, voice assistant support, calls/texts, and more.</p><p>This all seems to have been rectified, as Vivo pushes on ahead with the X Fold 5.</p><p>Another point of interest is a report from 2023 that said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-considered-making-android-compatible-watch">Apple nearly developed an Android-compatible watch</a>, but dropped it due to "business considerations." Such a device would've brought all of Apple's health and fitness features to Android. However, Apple took it back, feeling it best to keep its features and watch in-house.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OpenAI caught the tech world by surprise, including stalwarts like Apple and Google. However, those two brands responded to ChatGPT’s success in completely different ways. While the former is still trying to find its footing, Google recovered nicely, and Gemini is arguably a better chatbot for most people than ChatGPT in 2025.</p><p>If you’re still using ChatGPT, I don’t blame you. Google’s start in the AI race with Bard wasn’t the best, but it has come a long way in the Gemini era. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/theres-a-massive-chatgpt-outage-maybe-its-time-to-switch-over-to-gemini">OpenAI’s 12-hour ChatGPT outage</a> could serve as the perfect reason to give a competitor another shot, like Gemini.</p><p>I have access to ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, Perplexity, and more on my suite of devices, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is the only AI client I need. In fact, I haven’t used ChatGPT in two years, and these three features help explain why.</p><h2 id="fine-tuned-models-tailed-to-specific-purposes-2">Fine-tuned models tailed to specific purposes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tZdsnoUnZmncNX3cVBVAQi" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-21.jpg" alt="Gemini response on Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZdsnoUnZmncNX3cVBVAQi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The wide variety of models and tools available under the Gemini umbrella is a huge reason why I stick to Google AI’s suite. There are just a few main types of Gemini models, including Gemini Nano, Gemini Flash, and Gemini Pro. It gets more nuanced than that in the nitty-gritty, when you consider offshoots like Gemini Personalization, but those three handle most of your AI needs.</p><p>Gemini Nano handles on-device mobile AI tasks, Gemini Flash takes care of simple, everyday requests, and Gemini Pro is for advanced, specialized needs. They’re not just competitors to the latest ChatGPT models; they’re winners. Google currently holds the top two spots on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard" target="_blank">LMArena’s leaderboard</a>, and they’re both preview versions of Gemini 2.5 Pro. The Gemini 2.5 Pro preview model is also the champion on LMArena’s WebDev leaderboard, too.</p><p>OpenAI’s models tie for second place on the LMArena leaderboard, but can’t be found until seventh place on the WebDev rankings. The days of OpenAI models being the industry leader in every category are over, as Gemini models will beat ChatGPT models in many major benchmarks. There’s a model for every use case, whether you need an efficient model for on-device processing, a lightweight model to reduce token (cost) usage, a thinking model that shows its work, or a specialized model for specific use cases.</p><p>If the expansive set of stock offerings isn’t enough, you can build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-let-you-share-custom-gems-for-gemini-in-the-mobile-app">Gems</a>, which are custom AI chatbots similar to OpenAI’s custom GPTs.</p><h2 id="integration-with-android-and-chromeos-2">Integration with Android and ChromeOS</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KcR7JnGvLMXQrMQfZThmBk" name="Gemini-Live-S25-Pixel-9" alt="Gemini Live on the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcR7JnGvLMXQrMQfZThmBk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For most people, knowing which AI model ranks higher on uber-specific benchmarks is inconsequential for their daily needs. That’s why Gemini’s integration with popular mobile operating systems is its true differentiator. With the Gemini app, you can use the service on a variety of platforms, including iOS and iPadOS. However, things really get good if you happen to use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablet</a>, or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">ChromeOS laptop</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Gemini is replacing the Google Assistant</a>, so the AI helper is only a button press or a voice command away at any time on the majority of Android phones. With Gemini Live, you can speak to the AI model in natural language and even share your screen or camera feed to add context. It’s not that ChatGPT can’t do these same things; it’s that they’re packaged in a much more convenient way with Gemini.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-4" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The easy access makes Gemini a more helpful companion for solving real-world problems.

However, Google’s free and accessible model for Google Workspace has helped many people ditch Microsoft 365 (formerly Office) for good. If that sounds like you, you’ll be happy to know that Gemini is deeply integrated with Workspace to help you get productivity tasks done.</p><p>Gemini’s presence in Workspace apps goes so deep it’s impossible to cover them all at once. It makes three main types of appearances in the Workspace suite: powering individual features, as standalone apps, and as a chatbot sidebar.</p><p>For instance, Workspace apps like Google Vids (an AI-powered presentation generator) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gemini-notebooklm-gaming-guide-creation">NotebookLM</a> (an AI-powered notebook) are new apps with Gemini AI at their core. Legacy apps like Google Docs or Google Slides have a Gemini sidebar for quick help with tasks such as summarization or generation. They also have individual AI-powered features, like contextual smart replies in Gmail, which leverage Google AI behind the scenes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wPn9wa7YPD6prA7EqcmuAK" name="22073_GWS_IO_Press_Demo_GIF_contextual_Smart_replie_01" alt="Google Workspace features added in the April 2025 feature drop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wPn9wa7YPD6prA7EqcmuAK.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That sounds like a lot, but it means that Gemini will meet you where you are.

One major specification is that Xreal's glasses, codenamed "Project Aura," will require a "tethered puck" for its computing processes. In short, the glasses won't have the capability to process all of the data they absorb from within the frames. Users will need to have this computing puck with them.</p><p>Inside this puck is said to be a Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC. However, Xreal didn't detail which Qualcomm chip it will choose to empower Project Aura, so we might have to wait a little longer on that.</p><p>Something that's a little more concrete was discussed regarding Project Aura's lens displays. According to the post, the company stated Project Aura will receive "flat prism lens" technology. This tech will supposedly increase a user's field of view to roughly 70 degrees, thanks to its "triangular-shaped glass pane." More than that, Xreal states the glasses will contain a modified X1 chip known as the X1S. The former can be found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> frames.</p><h2 id="a-familiar-tune-2">A Familiar Tune</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MAza8BgvHSEtURDMmYYkaY" name="xreal-one-wearing-01" alt="Wearing a pair of Xreal One glasses while working on a laptop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MAza8BgvHSEtURDMmYYkaY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing worth unpacking in all of this is Xreal's reported reliance on a puck for Project Aura's heavier computing power. This is quite similar to what Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">did with its Orion AR glasses</a>. Consumers were required to pop a wallet-sized puck into their pockets, so the glasses could do their thing. However, Meta's Orion could pull data from the puck remotely via Quest Air Link. What Xreal has reportedly described is a "tethered" experience.</p><p>Meta also made its puck much more efficient, so we'll have to see where Xreal lands with Project Aura.</p><p>If you missed it, Xreal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye">unveiled Project Aura</a> during I/O 2025, its first-ever pair of XR-powered smart glasses. Xreal showed off some of its tech, like the use of three cameras in front to capture spatial data. This enables Project Aura to track/understand where you are, like a VR headset. More importantly, Project Aura is an OST device (optical see-through). This lets the user see the world around them while also viewing their virtual notifications or navigational directions.</p><p>Xreal is preparing to debut Project Aura officially later this year. On a related note, the Xreal Eye, a $99 add-on for its One smart glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xreal.com/eye/">went up for pre-order</a> in some places.</p> ]]></dc:content>

By accelerating the launch window, the company is able to deliver the stable build several months in advance, and that lets upcoming phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> run Android 16 out of the box. This was an issue in previous years, as Google traditionally released the latest version of Android at the end of Q3 or early Q4, with most devices debuting in the fall missing out on the update.</p><p>Another interesting change is that this won't be the only Android release in 2025; Google plans to deliver another update in Q4 (dubbed the minor release) that includes new APIs and features. In addition, Google will continue offering quarterly updates, and if anything, most of the exciting changes announced with Android 16 — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive interface</a> and Desktop Mode — won't be available until the QPR1 build in Q3.</p><p>As a result, the Android 16 update that's available today doesn't look any different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>; you still get a few interesting features, but we are well past the point where every new release of Android brings groundbreaking additions. That said, Google continues to deliver meaningful changes to the interface that make a difference in daily use, and notable privacy tweaks. This is what you need to know about Android 16.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-lock-it-down-with-advanced-protection"><span>Lock it down with Advanced Protection</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DiDNbkVmw8rcHpXSwjhu9X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DiDNbkVmw8rcHpXSwjhu9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Previous versions</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15 review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14 review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13 review</a></p></div></div><p>Security continues to play a sizeable role in Android updates, and Google is building on that in Android 16 with the introduction of Advanced Protection. Dubbed the "most effective security features," the suite includes intrusion logging, theft detection lock, inactivity reboot after 72 hours, offline device lock, spam and scam protection in Messages, automatic call screening, caller ID and spam within the dialer, and so much more.</p><p>You even get USB protection, wherein the phone defaults to charging with any new USB connection when the device is locked. Google is doubling down on safe browsing by enforcing HTTPS and by blocking installation of apps from unknown sources. This is easily one of the most robust security features available today, and the best part is that enabling all of these is about as easy as it gets — you just get a single toggle.</p><p>More than anything else, it's this ease of use that differentiates most Advanced Protection. Most of the time, there is noticeable friction in setting up additional security safeguards, and that acts as a deterrent. In this case, Google made it extremely straightforward to secure your phone, and I can't wait to see other brands integrate the feature in their Android 16 releases.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-delivering-much-needed-usability-features"><span>Delivering much-needed usability features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v7jfku6L5vdXHejviBRe9X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v7jfku6L5vdXHejviBRe9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">You may like: </div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7 review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">New features in OxygenOS 15</a></p></div></div><p>Foldables are better than ever, but a constant issue when I'm using the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> is that text scaling isn't uniform. There are select apps that just don't take advantage of the increased canvas in unfolded mode, and Google is tackling this in Android 16 by mandating text scaling across device sizes.</p><p>This makes things considerably easier on a foldable, and while I'm yet to see a difference at this point, that will change with imminent app updates. Most social media apps like Instagram and TikTok already do a good job in this area, and it's mostly smart home utilities (looking at you, Govee) that don't scale well on a foldable — that's set to change.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-declutter-your-notifications"><span>Declutter your notifications</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BDxFvuX8cKaaerXSpiJS6X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BDxFvuX8cKaaerXSpiJS6X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I get so many notifications over the course of a day that I enable DND just so I don't get constantly disturbed by my phone. Android does a good job with DND in general — unless you're using a OnePlus phone — and Google is streamlining things by grouping all notifications from an app.</p><p>This does a long way in minimizing notification clutter, and alongside notification cooldown, it makes a tangible difference.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-make-your-battery-last-longer"><span>Make your battery last longer</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9ftuBUuenNKQ8ByWumsg9X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ftuBUuenNKQ8ByWumsg9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is addressing battery longevity by rolling out a new Battery Health feature. Located within the Battery menu in the settings, the page gives you an indicator regarding the status of your phone's battery, and suggestions on what you can do to extend the longevity.</p><p>The feature estimates the charge level of your phone battery, and you can use it in conjunction with charge limit — where it doesn't charge beyond 80% — to ensure long-term durability. Annoyingly, this feature is only available on the Pixel 8a and above, so if you're using an older Pixel, you miss out on it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-now-everyone-can-use-predictive-back-gestures-sort-of"><span>Now everyone can use predictive back gestures (sort of)</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wjj8rCJwGmm4pkKW6fms6X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wjj8rCJwGmm4pkKW6fms6X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is making the predictive back gesture more accessible in Android 16 — it now works with the legacy three-button navigation in addition to gestures. If you're on the older navigation system, long pressing the back button shows a preview of the previous page.</p><p>Of course, this would be useful if the back gesture had much utility, but that just isn't the case. Even Chrome doesn't have the gesture, so it isn't particularly surprising that most users don't even know something like this exists. Google needs to mandate the use of this gesture for it to see any kind of mainstream use, and before that, it needs to add it to its own services.</p><p>Talking about gestures, you can now double press the power button to launch Google Wallet instead of the camera, should you wish to do so. I would have liked greater customizability in selecting what to launch with the button — just like what ASUS does on its phones — but we aren't at that point yet.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-edge-to-edge-mode-is-now-standard"><span>Edge to edge mode is now standard</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bhbnqR836Prgab3a3nfy8X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhbnqR836Prgab3a3nfy8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android 16 mandates edge-to-edge mode, so text looks cleaner if you prefer reading long-form content on your phone.

Samsung has been the frontrunner in this regard with DeX, and instead of reinventing the wheel, Google is leveraging Samsung's know-how to bring it to a wider audience.</p><p>With desktop windowing, you can easily connect any Android phone to a monitor. With most phones now coming with USB-C 3.2 standard with DisplayPort, it should be relatively straightforward to connect phones via USB-C. Google is also bringing the ability to customize keyboard shortcuts, and it should make extending your phone screen to a larger panel that much smoother.</p><p>The only caveat is that it isn't available now; you'll need to wait until the QPR1 build. While that's annoying, at least Google isn't pushing it to next year — as has been the case with too many features lately.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-get-real-time-notification-updates"><span>Get real-time notification updates</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z53LUiPMMAXq29YdH2wm4X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z53LUiPMMAXq29YdH2wm4X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like how iPhones integrate Live Activities into the camera cutout, and while a few Android manufacturers have their own take on the feature, Google is standardizing it with Live Updates. Whenever you book a cab or order food, you'll see a real-time notification that changes based on the status of that action.</p><p>What's good to hear is that the feature will be integrated into Samsung’s Now Bar and OPPO and OnePlus’ Live Alerts, so it should be seamless — once it goes live, that is.

While there isn't much in the way of marquee additions, the latest version of Android brings better stability and usability tweaks, and honestly, that's what matters more in daily use.</p><p>Like previous years, it will be a few months before other manufacturers roll out their Android 16 updates. Given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-launch-messy">issues Samsung had with One UI 7</a>, I don't see the brand bringing One UI 8 to Galaxy devices anytime soon. Google is doing its part by making the version available sooner than before, and most phones launching this fall should run Android 16 as standard.</p><p>Yearly Android releases aren't as exciting as they used to be, and that's because Google is doing a better job rolling out features over the course of the year. The imminent Android 16 QPR1 build will be a significant release, bringing with it the biggest visual overhaul in three years. The ultimate goal with Android 16 is to have it pre-installed on more devices than previous years, and that by itself is noteworthy.</p> ]]></dc:content>

What I didn't expect to see was the transformation of the iPad from an entertainment device that could be used for more in a pinch, to an almost desktop-like interface that rivals <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-130-chromebook-plus-update-rollout">Google's Chrome OS</a> — and surpasses it in many ways.</p><p>There are a good many changes and new features. I'll be honest and say that I really don't care about most of them, probably because I'm not a big iPad user.</p><p>Of course, you have updates to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-gemini-and-other-ai-models-could-come-to-iphones-in-the-future">Apple Intelligence</a>, Apple's AI platform. Providing features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-googles-live-translate-feature">live translation</a> is important on a phone, but not so much on a larger device that you aren't as apt to carry around everywhere.</p><p>The same goes for new gaming features and things like Apple's Genmoji or the addition of the Journal app. Good news for people who wanted this, but their inclusion doesn't make me want to rush out and start using them.</p><h2 id="the-most-important-ipados-updates-are-coming-2">The most important iPadOS updates are coming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zMwMZenRYBJNemUjUY86Dg" name="2022-apple-macbook-air-imore.jpg" alt="MacBook Air M2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zMwMZenRYBJNemUjUY86Dg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: iMore / Gerald Lynch)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What <em>did</em> get me excited were the interface changes. Particularly, the new multi-windowing system, the new dock features, and a new set of background tasks APIs. This is what can make the iPad great: transform it from a glorified couch toy into a bona fide replacement for a light laptop.</p><p>In fact, while watching the show with my coworkers, I said, "<em><strong>The new iPad is now the best Chromebook</strong></em>." And I meant it. It's not built to look or act the same way as ChromeOS, but it's every bit as good. In some ways, it will be better.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kFGLivYf87CtiqAuFzbbb5" name="iPadOS-26-windowing" alt="New windowing system in iPadOS 26" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kFGLivYf87CtiqAuFzbbb5.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The primary reason is the ability to perform more tasks in the background while also displaying more active elements simultaneously. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/things-i-hope-google-adds-chrome-os-2020-and-beyond">Resizable windows</a> aren't anything new and something we've even seen on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> for a while. But Apple will do it differently.</p><p>Maybe not better, though. What Apple has that Google doesn't is control. Google can give developers all the tools in the world to make an app's contents gracefully resize when the user changes the window geometry, but it can't <em>force</em> developers to use any of them. On the iPad, if you want your app to be in the iPad store, you do it Apple's way.</p><p>I hate this in theory. But it will bring a level of consistency and compatibility that Android can't match. Short of going back to the drawing board and making a full-fledged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-preview-windows-11-wsa">Microsoft Windows</a>-style system, this is the answer, at least until something better comes along.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mqqxXs6Lx6VUchhNPd39aW" name="select-split-screen-app-screenshot.jpeg" alt="A screenshot showing split-screen apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mqqxXs6Lx6VUchhNPd39aW.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you can see everything you're working on and have "stuff" working in the background thanks to the new APIs, you are more than a screen to watch videos on or play games.</p><p>To make all of this even better, changes to the dock and the Files app are also welcome. What Apple has done is make the iPad feel more like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mid-range-chromebook-still-better-buy-new-macbook-air">MacBook Air</a> than the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review"> iPhone</a>, and thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-a17-pro-is-a-landmark-moment-for-apple">its own silicon</a> and development platform, it should work without a hitch.</p><h2 id="apple-is-tempting-me-to-ditch-my-chromebook-2">Apple is tempting me to ditch my Chromebook</h2><p>This is a big deal. Big enough to make me want to buy a new iPad and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dont-buy-new-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-buy-combo-instead">Magic Keyboard</a>. I love my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> because they're light on resources, easy to carry around, have great battery life, and can do almost everything a "real" computer can do.</p><p>But you can't deny that Apple's MacBooks are even better when it comes to getting things done. My MacBook Pro triple boots macOS, Windows 10, and Debian Linux. I can do <em>anything</em> with it. It stays at home because it's big, heavy, and drinks electricity like water. A Chromebook can do almost as much without the drawbacks or the price tag of a new MacBook.</p><p>If Apple could package all this up in an affordable package and sell a $500 setup with this level of ability, I would buy one and then tell you to go out and buy one. Chromebook be damned.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you're a new subscriber to the NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV or YouTube, you will find a differently priced set of plans. According to the post, the Season Pass on YouTube TV for the 2025-2026 NFL season will cost $276 or 12 payments of $23 per month. If you're interested in RedZone, that'll take things up to $318 or 12 payments of $26.50 per month.</p><p>Those opting for YouTube's Primetime Channels can grab their first Sunday Ticket season for the same prices as previously stated.</p><p>It's worth stressing that these reduced pricing options are only available for new users and their <strong>first </strong>season with the NFL Sunday Ticket. Moving on, YouTube states students looking to grab the NFL Sunday Ticket Student Plan <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13770167">can do so</a> for $119. Military personnel, veterans, teachers, and nurses will receive a discounted version of the NFL plan, which comes to $198, "in the next few days."</p><p>The NFL Sunday Ticket evolves again due to user feedback, as YouTube states it's rolling out the option for viewers in more states to purchase/pay for the Season Pass in 12 monthly installments. YouTube warns that the plan length will shorten as the season nears (going from 12 months to 8 monthly payments).</p><h2 id="pre-season-s-right-around-the-corner-2">Pre-Season's right around the corner</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1l7k5zm/payment_options_pricing_for_the_nfl_sunday_ticket">Payment Options & Pricing for the NFL Sunday Ticket ‘25-’26 Season</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv">r/youtubetv</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Alternatively, users can expect YouTube TV to bring its Month-to-Month plan in early September. This gives users more flexibility in <em>how </em>they want to enjoy their football season.</p><p>Users who've had the NFL Sunday Ticket before aren't in for any special deals or discounts as of right now. YouTube TV states you should still expect the same $378 charge for the Season Pass and $480 for YouTube's Primetime Channels.</p><p>YouTube TV has continued to update its NFL Sunday Ticket experience, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-fantasy-custom-multiview-nfl-sunday-ticket">last summer brought customization</a>. During pre-season in August, YouTube TV said users could enjoy "build a multiview." Viewers can create a personal streaming view that consists of two, three, or four games to watch at once. Moreover, users can even attach their Yahoo Fantasy accounts to their NFL Sunday Ticket account to see fantasy scores as they change.</p><p>The addition of extra playback controls and a spoiler mode entered last season to further progress the Sunday Ticket.</p> ]]></dc:content>
