For those who want to control their earbuds without using a mobile app, the retailer has cut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3631X1B"><strong>20% off these JBL Live Buds 3</strong>,</a> which feature a robust charging screen display.</p><p>The Live Buds 3 offer true wireless earbud functionality, and JBL says they'll get you 40 hours total of playback time with the use of the charging case. They also feature adaptive noise cancellation for customizing how much you need to hear your surroundings, and the six microphones offer clear audio for phone calls and voice commands.</p>

<p>Meta and UFC have joined forces as part of an expansive, multi-year partnership to make Meta products and technologies a key part of UFC, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ufc.com/news/ufc-announces-comprehensive-multiyear-partnership-with-meta" target="_blank">announced</a> today, April 2. The partnership with Meta will "leverage its leading technologies to deliver unprecedented engagement with hundreds of millions of UFC fans around the world."</p><p>Meta becomes UFC's first Official Fan Technology Partner, as well as its first Official AI Glasses Partner (Ray-Ban Meta) and Official Social Media Partner (Threads). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> in particular will be used "in compelling ways at UFC events."

<p>Now that the partnership is official, UFC President and CEO Dana White may have more to share regarding the new Meta experiences in the future.</p><p>"I've had a lot of great partners over the years that have helped us grow this sport, but Mark and his team at Meta are going to do things that will blow away UFC fans," said White.  "Meta has the greatest minds in tech and they are going to take fan engagement to the next level.  We've already started to work on some innovations with Meta around a new fighter rankings system that I'll be sharing soon."</p><p>The financial terms of the deal were not made public, but Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and MMA fighter himself — shares White's optimism.</p><p>"I love this sport and I’m looking forward to working with the UFC to let fans experience it in new ways," said Zuckerberg.</p><p>The two companies say that additional details of the partnership will be announced in the future.</p>

I made a mockup above based on Bloomberg's description, which should give you an idea of what to expect.</p><p>But it's the sEMG band that might be the most exciting feature, as it means a proper smart device experience can be had without having to hold a smartphone all the time. It means apps can be interacted with without feeling clunky like they do on a smartwatch, and it means messages can not only be read but also easily responded to.</p><p>I previously covered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">how sEMG bands work</a>, but the gist is that they can sense muscle movements in your hand and understand the difference between pinching your fingers together and scrolling with your thumb. The only thing that might get in the way is typing, but that's something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">Meta AI</a> is already very capable of doing by using your voice.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The glasses are expected to be bundled with an sEMG band, which will make it dead easy to interact with apps despite the small screen.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This is a huge step in the right direction for Meta as the company has struggled to release smart glasses products early enough to satisfy investors, often seeming to focus on the big picture rather than delivering smaller stepping-stone products that will get consumers interested in the concept.</p><p>The company's second pair of connected Ray-Ban glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">have been a hit</a>, with Meta ramping up production in hopes of selling as many as 10 million this year. The next obvious step is to offer a new pair with a single display that begins getting people used to looking forward at a display instead of craning their necks downward all the time.</p><p>As this display is situated in the bottom portion of the right lens, you'll have to gaze downward at least a little bit to get the clearest view. From my estimation, this is a much better design than Google Glass — the closest conceptual product I can think of — as Glass required you to look <em>up</em> to see the display. If I'm walking in a city and need to look at directions, I don't want to be looking away from the sidewalk.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9gfNHgJm4cSfD3BPB3TQ5M" name="ray-ban-meta-view-app" alt="The Meta View app, used to connect to Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, running on an Honor Magic V3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gfNHgJm4cSfD3BPB3TQ5M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Meta View app which will be used to connect the glasses to your phone. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since these glasses are powered by Android, Bloomberg says there will be a handful of apps that ship with it but that it won't have a dedicated app store. Apps include Meta's messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Messenger, a camera app for using the upgraded cameras on the glasses, as well as a maps app for visual directions and navigation.</p><p>But while these glasses aren't prepared to replace your phone just yet, they are the gateway into augmenting the phone experience to get you less reliant on your little black mirror and more comfortable with using Meta AI and alternative forms of input. They'll still connect to your phone using the Meta View app that existing Ray-Ban Meta glasses use, but at least some of that connection won't be required now that these glasses will have onboard computing.</p>

<p>These glasses will not feature positional tracking like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> prototype or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-aria-gen-2-smart-glasses-look-like-serious-upgrade-on-ray-ban-meta">Meta Aria Gen 2</a> research glasses. Most likely, this is to help shave some of the cost off the price tag as well as provide reasonable battery life.</p><p>It's unreasonable to expect a fully-featured pair of smart glasses to somehow be light enough for comfort <em>and</em> have all-day battery life in this day and age, but that's a problem that might be solved a few years in the future.</p><p>Meta is also said to be upgrading the camera, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-have-given-me-a-new-reason-to-record-video-again">I'm particularly excited about</a> since I use the Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses camera all the time. The analogy was that the current camera is roughly equivalent to an iPhone 11, while the new camera will be equivalent to an iPhone 13.</p><p>This is, essentially, the start of the future Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke about when he said Meta would lead the tech space into a post-smartphone era. These new Hypernova glasses are said to retail for between $1,000 and $1,400, so it'll still be a while before they're affordable enough to make a dent in the smartphone market.</p>

<p>Meta looks to be releasing several different shades this year, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">a potential Oakley-branded pair</a> known as Supernova 2 within Meta's R&D labs. These glasses will be more full-featured than Hypernova and are said to be optimized for athletic use, which makes sense given Oakley's popularity with bikers and in some other sports.</p><p>Bloomberg's report also details the existence of Hypernova 2, a follow-up to the glasses described above that would feature two displays — one in each lens. Meta is said to still be working on a fully standalone pair of smart glasses that don't rely on a connection to a phone, but those glasses — currently known as Artemis — are likely still two years away.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">Samsung's Project HAEAN</a> smart glasses are said to be making a debut this year alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a> XR headset. HAEAN is said to look similar to Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses and is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>, similar to the Google smart glasses you see in the image above.</p><p>HAEAN will likely be a direct competitor to the upcoming Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, as they reportedly feature a display in the lenses.

<ul><li>A tipster claims there's evidence in the Galaxy S24's One UI 7 beta code that points towards the possibility of Now Brief support.</li><li>Nothing works; however, the tipster was able to discover the Now Brief's official page and app options.</li><li>A Samsung exec recently stated that not every major AI feature in One UI 7 will hit older devices due to hardware limitations.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amidst the One UI 7 anticipation, it seems a few of Samsung's older devices could receive a Galaxy S25 feature.</p><p>There's a chance Samsung could drop a version of One UI 7's Now Brief on one of its past-gen Galaxy series, at least according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MEMETCAN88/status/1906770062435889446">Mehmet Kaya on X</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-now-brief-galaxy-s23-fold-6-flip-6-more-devices/">SamMobile</a>). The rumor started after the tipster allegedly discovered the feature while searching "Activity Launcher" in the latest OS beta. The tipster states searching for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a> will bring up its respective page full of feature details, as well as its list of supported Samsung apps.</p><p>However, they add that users won't see it in action during the beta. In their thread, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MEMETCAN88/status/1906790896261067217">the tipster states</a> Samsung has "disabled it," which could indicate more work is required before it can be seen.</p><p>Another user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1892878357009699231">That Josh Guy</a>, chimed in, stating these whispers of Now Brief for the Galaxy S24 appeared in One UI 7 Beta 4. The user states the small "traces of code" don't give a live example but only hint at its base functions and pages where users can customize it or update it. Their post states they had to go "root level deep" to even access the core of the function, which seemingly indicates the ability for the Galaxy S24 to run Now Brief.</p><p>It's not clear if Samsung plans to bring the Now Brief to the past-gen series when One UI 7 launches or</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking. Now brief feature is available in s24 series. Oneui 7 beta 6 is also hidden but I've uncovered with activity launcher.@tarunvats33 @SamMobiles @theonecid @UniverseIce pic.twitter.com/uvLoHZOJAu<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1906770062435889446">March 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, the publication notes that the same code was discovered in the One UI 7 beta for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6.</p><p>This discovery leads us back to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">a recent interview</a> with Samsung's EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally. During the discussion, Sally highlighted that not every One UI 7 feature will arrive for Samsung's past-gen devices. They stated major on-device processes, like the Personal Data Engine, are extremely reliant on the phone's or tablet's available hardware. As such, the engine requires Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> to operate.</p><p>Sally added that more affordable phones will likely miss out on the bulk of One UI 7's major AI features since the available hardware isn't strong enough. One question that remained was whether or not the Now Bar/Now Brief would arrive on older phones. Nothing is confirmed, but evidence of the feature <em>could </em>indicate that this specific feature isn't so hardware-reliant.</p><p>Either way, Samsung confirmed One UI 7 will arrive on April 10 in the U.S. However, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-schedule-galaxy-dates-spotted-overseas">fully detailed rollout schedule</a> was discovered on its Czech Republic website, potentially giving us an idea of what to expect.</p>

<p>NotebookLM is an AI-powered notebook that can help you study or understand virtually anything, and it works by intaking uploaded content, called sources. These sources could be documents, notes, or webpages, and you can upload them to a NotebookLM project. Starting today, April 2, Google is automating the process with a new <strong>Discover sources</strong> feature that scours the web for source links on your behalf, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-discover-sources/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>This functionality combines Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini's</a> ability to search the web with sourcing in NotebookLM projects. When users click the new <strong>Discover sources</strong> button in NotebookLM, they can describe the topic of their project. After that, NotebookLM takes care of the rest.</p><p>"NotebookLM gathers hundreds of potential web sources in seconds," Google explains. "It analyzes them and picks the most relevant ones based on your defined topic. It presents up to 10 source recommendations, each with an annotated summary explaining its relevance to your topic."</p><p>By checking the box for each suggested source recommendation, it will become available in your NotebookLM project, providing additional context. These sources can be used with Briefing Docs, FAQs, and Audio Overviews, and are also available for reading, note-taking, and citation purposes. On top of that, you can use the chatbot to converse with AI about the suggested sources.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">NotebookLM</a> is also getting a new feature that pays homage to Google Search's famous <strong>I'm feeling lucky</strong> button. It's called <strong>I'm feeling curious</strong>, and it "generates sources on a random topic, offering a quick way for you to see the product’s source discovery agent in action."</p><p>Google says the Discover sources feature is "the first of a series of NotebookLM features that uses the power of Gemini to find and collect relevant sources for your notebook."</p><p>The tool will be available to all NotebookLM users, on free and paid tiers, and is rolling out starting today. It could take a week for all users to gain access to the feature.</p>

<p>Similar to how Google has worked to bring more AI features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsung-lenovo-debut-chromebooks-google-update-details">to the Chromebook Plus</a>, MediaTek states it has done the same in tandem with the former. Adam King adds, "We worked closely with Google to ensure the newest Chromebook Plus devices enjoy next-generation on-device AI capabilities, superior performance per watt, and immersive multimedia.”</p><p>The Taiwanese OEM announced it has integrated 50 TOPS NPU for "greater" on-device generative AI processes. This 8th-generation NPU also brings personalized computing capabilities, "seamless" AI-enhanced workflows, and more. Future consumers can also expect quicker local processing speeds, security, efficiency, and AI workload support even without a Wi-Fi connection.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google's VP and GM for ChromeOS and Google for Education, John Solomon, said, "We're excited for the next step in our MediaTek partnership." Solomon states this new venture will open up "new avenues for on-device AI" while also delivering "awesome power efficiency" when users are on the go.</p>

<hr>
<p>New information regarding a year-old rumor about a Find My Device update may suggest an impending launch.</p><p>X tipster AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/find-my-device-uwb-3540807/">Android Authority</a> went through a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/ask-jerry-which-earbuds-support-google-find-my-device-network-2024">Find My Device</a> app update, which holds more clues about its supposed UWB update. One of the highlights in Google's newly uploaded code/content includes a UWB function animation. The tipster was able to view this short clip, which will allegedly direct users on how to hold their phone to relocate lost devices.</p><p>The feature seems to prefer to be held more upright or slightly tilted back; however, holding your phone more landscape will interfere with its UWB relocator.</p><p>Meanwhile, v3.1.305-1 of the app has reportedly received extra bits of code as Google progresses with the feature. The post highlights the existence of the UWB-powered scanning dubbed "precision_finding" in the app. Here, the code gives more info behind that early demo video, stating you should "hold your phone straight up and try moving around." This will supposedly aid in its accuracy.</p><p>Interestingly, the early strings of code state the feature might rely on your room's lighting situation. One string states, "more light needed to find the device."</p>

<p>Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ar-directions-uwb-find-my-device">of UWB support</a> headed for the Find My Device app started in early June 2024. Code from almost a year ago echoes what we've seen today, at least regarding its name: "precision finding." There wasn't much else back then when compared to what Google has added to the app's code recently. However, it seems the company has plans to implement more AR-based directions, too.</p><p>Last year's discovery showcased how the app could use AR technology to direct users on-screen to where their UWB-supported tracker/device is. More concrete details on its complete functions aren't known yet, but it seems Google hasn't dropped this idea.</p><p>The Find My Device app has been relatively quiet, aside from a recent update that brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-find-my-device-app-people-tab-update-rollout">a new "People" tab</a>. From the new page, users can easily share their current location with "trusted contacts." The feature mirrors what you'd find in Google Maps as your family or friends will see your profile picture, name, location (address), and device battery. This feature was mentioned in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">Google's March feature drop</a>, but it just started rolling out two weeks after its initial highlight.</p>

The accounts in concern are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ScreenCultureOfficial">Screen Culture</a> and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kh+studio"> KH Studio</a> trailers which have over two million subscribers combined.</p>

<p>Screen Culture, which has over 1.4 million subscribers, is notorious for creating conceptual fan trailers of movies that look like the real deal. In the recent past, the account has been leveraging AI to create scenarios with existing footage from old movies and mashing it up with new AI footage to create fake trailers.</p><p>KH Studios, with nearly 700K subscribers, creates trailers based on imagined movies and "what if" scenarios. For example, they've created trailers imagining Henry Cavill as the next James Bond or Leonardo DiCaprio in a Squid Game season, Deadline states.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JJqpuE33cUF7cMEp8L9gw8" name="Youtube-KH-studios-Ironman4-fan trailer" alt="Image showing KH studio's Iron Man 4 fan trailer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JJqpuE33cUF7cMEp8L9gw8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Due to both channels showcasing misleading content, YouTube suspended both Screen Culture and KH Studios for violating monetization policies, and now they cannot earn ad revenue from all of their videos. While both channels can appeal to counter YouTube's decision, its highly unlikely that things will change in their favor.</p><p>YouTube's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392?hl=en"> monetization policy clearly states</a> that while creators do have freedom of speech, they should "avoid creating content that is misleading or controversial and the "video content should not be deceptive or clickbait." And both channels seem to be repeat offenders of the above.</p>

<p>While Screen Culture is yet to put out an official statement or comment on the matter, KH Studios' founder told Deadline, “I’ve been running KH Studio full-time for over three years now, putting everything into it. It’s tough to see it grouped under “misleading content” in the demonetization decision when my goal has always been to explore creative possibilities – not to misrepresent real releases,” they added.</p><p>YouTube hasn't commented on the matter yet. However, Android Central has reached out to the streaming platform and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>It looks like Samsung is all but guaranteed to bring back the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. And while it's the right move to resurrect its signature design, this alternating system leaves a gap year for Samsung fans who care, first and foremost, about battery life.</p><p>Or, to put it more bluntly, thinking about the inevitable Classic only makes me wistful for the dead Pro lineup, and I wish the two could be merged.</p><p>This week, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/new-leak-hints-at-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8s-existence">Galaxy Watch 8 leak</a> indicated it'll ship in its usual two case sizes, with the larger model hitting 435mAh capacity — just 10mAh more than the Watch 7 44mm. This same leak indicated there'll likely be two Watch 8 Classic models; we didn't see any battery data, but the Watch 6 Classic and 4 Classic both matched their cheaper counterparts.</p><p>A second leak indicated Samsung is working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">all-solid-state batteries</a>, but it won't add one to a Galaxy Watch until "late 2027." While OnePlus used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-kicks-off-battery-arms-race-for-smartwatches">silicon-carbon tech</a> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> to make it last five days, we can probably expect the usual 40-ish hours of battery life Samsung always offers.</p><p>Samsung will keep the Galaxy Watch 8 skinny and affordable, as it should. But if we're never going to see a Pro again — and with the Ultra too pricey for some — I'd like to see the Classic take after the Pro and bridge the battery gap, unlikely as that may seem.</p>

<p>I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a> the last three summers. Samsung's experimentation with new designs kept things so fresh that it gave me whiplash; I never knew what Samsung would prioritize in a given year.</p><p>I only started reviewing smartwatches regularly in 2022. After a few skinny, plastic running watches with weeks-long battery life, the 2022 Watch 5 Pro was my first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> (or traditional smartwatch, period). I was a relative newbie, in other words, and my complaints against it feel mostly off-base now.</p><p>I said the Pro "gave a whole new meaning to the word heavy." With later context, it's still not what I'd call light, but most flagship watches are trending bulkier by about half an ounce. And it earns the weight, thanks to the battery. I was being way too dramatic.</p><p>I complained that the Pro was uncomfortable for sleep tracking, not realizing yet that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">I hated wearing <em>any</em> smartwatch to bed</a>. I stand by my complaint about the terrible default D-Buckle Sport band, though.</p><p>I argued that there "wasn't enough difference" in performance between the Pro and Watch 5, but that's been the norm on much pricier Ultra watches because there aren't enough smartwatch chips for there to <em>be</em> any differentiation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mJjRWwATDCDjZs6CSKawze" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-vs.-Watch-5-Pro-on-wrists.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mJjRWwATDCDjZs6CSKawze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't want to keep wearing the Watch 5 Pro <em>now</em>: the chip is a couple of generations behind, with less RAM and a dimmer, thicker-bordered display than I'm used to these days. However, I do think that the Pro's design didn't deserve to be a one-off, and I'd be much kinder to a new version today.</p><p>My wrist has been trained for heavier watches like the Galaxy Watch Ultra or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, but growing accustomed to something doesn't mean I prefer it. Once I tried the three-day <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> last year, it reminded me that you don't need a <em>massive</em> watch<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review"> </a>for it to be long-lasting.</p><p>Man, would I love a Galaxy Watch 8 Pro with a battery to write home about, paired with three generations of upgrades. But since that may not happen, let's talk about the rumored Classic.</p>
<h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-can-be-more-than-a-pretty-face-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic can be more than a pretty face</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3tfd7js5w3hVqAtRgwv2X5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-apps.jpg" alt="The app list on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tfd7js5w3hVqAtRgwv2X5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Samsung sticks to the same look as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</a> and Watch 6 Classic, I'm sure a Watch 8 Classic will remain popular with long-time fans. Samsung is oddly stubborn about adding a crown to its watches, so the Classic is our one chance to get more precise non-touch controls when navigating through tiles. And it looks great, especially the lighter case colors.</p><p>I simply wish that the Classic offered something more than a facelift. It's already quite heavy and thick thanks to the rotating bezel; to have it weigh about as much as any Ultra watch but last half as long is hard to accept, especially in an era where OnePlus has shown it's possible to stretch a Wear OS watch's battery to the limits.</p><p>Consider the report last year that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">Samsung exec was "angry" about "design plagiarism"</a> because the Galaxy Watch Ultra looked too much like an Apple Watch Ultra. I think some of this was overblown by the media; both Ultras look very different in person. But it's fair to question whether Samsung might go back to the drawing board with a new design or scrap the Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3701px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="C679DtBoDyMeLTiJWe6W5o" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C679DtBoDyMeLTiJWe6W5o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3701" height="2082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I suspect the Galaxy Watch Ultra lineup isn't going anywhere, even if it's redesigned. But it leaves the Classic in an awkward position because Samsung now wants to treat extra battery life as a $650 perk, even as $300–400 rivals lap it.</p><p>In an ideal world, Samsung would alternate between the Classic in odd years and <em>both</em> the Pro and Ultra in even years, so extra battery life is a mid-range perk in a more comfortable package while the Ultra adds other bells and whistles.</p><p>But since that's not going to happen, I'll settle for another unlikely alternative: a Watch 8 Classic that splits the difference and offers a <em>slight</em> battery boost. Even one more day would be appreciated!</p><p>So, until more leaks come in that dash my hopes, I'll cross my fingers that the Watch 8 Classic brings back a little bit of the Watch 5 Pro's legacy.</p>

<p>It is that time of the year where some Sony phone enthusiasts expect this year's flagship phone from the company, dubbed Xperia 1 VII. Ahead of the anticipated launch, a new leak reveals the device through renders and gives away some of the specs as well.</p><p>The leak comes from prominent tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka OnLeaks) in collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/sony-xperia-1-vii-cad-renders-360-degree-video/">XpertPick</a>,  has shared high-quality renders of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagship phone</a> from Sony. Going by the renders, it appears the company is sticking to the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vi-launch">Xperia 1 VI</a>'s design for the 1 VII too.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad... Here comes your very first look at the #Sony #Xperia1VII (360° video + crispy sharp 5K renders + dimensions)!😏Today, on behalf of new Partner XpertPick 👉🏻 https://t.co/X5rO50feYQ pic.twitter.com/PAlK0pmbw5<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1907383064432435631">April 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The phone appears taller with noticeable chins at the top and bottom of the display, while the side bezels seem negligible. On the right pane, we can notice the volume rocker, textured power button, and a dedicated camera button. The back panel also includes the familiar triple camera array as seen on the previous iterations.</p><p>While there aren't any notable visual changes on the upcoming Xperia 1 VII, the publication shares additional information about the handset, like its expected specifications.</p>

<p>The handset is expected to be powered by Snapdragon 8 Elite and will likely measure 161.9 x 74.5 x 8.5mm (approximately) — making it slightly thicker than the predecessor. The screen, however, is also predicted to be sporting the same 6.5-inch screen with a rumored 19.5:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>Further, the device is tipped to be featuring dual front-firing speakers and, in addition, users can also expect the good-old 3.5mm audio jack, which is sort of an Xperia exclusive parameter when it comes to flagship phones.</p><p>The handset is further expected to bank on Android 15 operating system out of the box and will likely be offered with a 5000mAh battery capacity and support for 30W fast charging. Lastly, going by the predecessor launch, the Xperia 1 VII is anticipated to be released sometime in May.</p>

From biotech to future tech and everything in between, I've wanted to try it all and then break it down so I understand how it works. Even so, if you had told me 30 years ago that one day, a small handheld device would be able to create an image out of thin air and a text prompt, I wouldn't have believed it.</p><p>Yet here we are, and your phone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">turn what you say into a picture through AI</a>. It's often not a great picture (and can even be a disturbing mess), but it's still a piece of machinery doing something that <em>used</em> to require a human. It still does. Technically, it requires a lot of humans to spend a lot of time.</p>

<h2 id="the-work-happens-before-you-use-it-2">The work happens before you use it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TkNeAYe9huCZSzBo5Xo3h8" name="Magic-Canvas-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024" alt="An AI-generated image of Sora from Kingdom Hearts and R2-D2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkNeAYe9huCZSzBo5Xo3h8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Modern AI works using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-pixel-5-have-neural-core-chip" target="_blank">neural network</a>. You might recognize that the word neural means related to the nervous system, and that's not accidental. Computers aren't organic and don't have a nervous system, but they can mimic the process and function in their own way. That's where everything starts: with a convolutional neural network.</p><p>These specialize in the ability to recognize patterns and objects — not in the same way we do, but in a way that's almost as cool, even if not nearly as complex as a human eye and brain.</p><p>You don't remember an exact replica of everything you've ever learned or can recognize. You know a shirt is a shirt regardless of what color it is, for example, because your brain knows what a shirt is; you don't have to see every shirt in the world to recognize one.</p><p>AI does something similar. It's trained from processing hundreds of millions of images, each with a description stating exactly what the image is. Take this one, for example:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qnseqCfB4Dh37ekFgoqbTi" name="cheeseburger" alt="A photo of a cheeseburger and fries." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qnseqCfB4Dh37ekFgoqbTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a cheeseburger and a side of fries. But it can be described in much more detail:</p><p><em>This is a photograph of food. It has a cheeseburger with two pieces of bacon and Swiss cheese, and a bun that looks moist. There are visible grill lines on the meat patty, and some of the meat patty's juices have soaked into the bun. There is also a wire basket that is a replica of a deep fryer basket holding at least 13 pieces of what look to be sliced potatoes. They have been fried, and at least one of them is slightly burned.</em></p><p><em>On a different, smaller plate are the remnants of an unknown appetizer with a small dish of unmelted butter in the center. There is also a small square plate with a fork and knife laid on it and a goblet off to the side filled partially with an unknown liquid. The tabletop is brown wood and there are reflections of red and yellow light near the top.</em></p><p>This is how images should be described as they are fed into an AI training algorithm. Every detail is analyzed, and nothing is insignificant because the computers doing the "looking" are looking for a pattern inside the visual noise of the photo.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>When training AI, every detail matters, even the seemingly insignificant ones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Eventually the model will be able to take a prompt and recreate the right noise patterns to build an image because it has the right amount of the right kind of data. Everything in an analyzed image is relevant, not just the cheeseburger that you and I would notice.</p><p>With enough analyzed data, it can serve as a path or set of instructions to create a new image that fulfills a user request. It's not taking bits and pieces of images it has already seen and piecing them together like a puzzle; it's simply creating patterns of visual noise. With enough training, those patterns end up looking like an image.</p><p>This also explains why some models get some things really wrong. AI can only create based on what it was trained on; if you train using 100,000,000 photos of black dogs but never include a brown one, the AI can never create an image of a brown dog, no matter how you try to tell it to do so.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.40%;"><img id="69EbhuuDiV5EZWBzmBosEX" name="Gemini-2.5-Pro-Graphs" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/69EbhuuDiV5EZWBzmBosEX.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="614" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-fiasco-proves-ai-is-moving-too-fast-for-googleso-whats-next">Bias exists</a> because AI is trained on web data, and certain things are overrepresented while others are underrepresented. This makes its way into the results because, as we discussed, AI can only recreate what it was trained on. Ask AI to create an image of a scientist wearing a shirt with the Croatian flag and blue sneakers, and the doctor will probably be Caucasian simply because of how the training data was represented.</p><p>You could ask for an image of a black scientist with the same shirt and shoes sitting in a wheelchair, and you would likely be presented with one. Like during the training, a good description matters a lot.</p>
<p>AI will continue to get better, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-image-3-custom-gems-update-detailed">image generation</a> will be part of it. Researchers have plenty of hurdles, not only with fine-tuning an algorithm and using representative data but also trying to ethically work around inherent bias and incomplete training data.</p><p>We've come a long way in just a few years, and things do not look to be slowing down anytime soon.</p>

<p>Only a day after we reported that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge could launch on April 15, new reports of its delayed launch have sprouted.</p><p>The latest Korean report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250402000203">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch-postponed-report/">SamMobile</a>) notes that Samsung might be halting the release of the anticipated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. It was initially tipped to be releasing in April but now it could probably happen only in May or June.</p><p>The report further noted that the Korean tech giant has indicated the same launch information to the telecom operators who are believed to be selling the upcoming Edge phone to the consumers in Korea.</p>

<p>The initial launch date according to the Korean report has been set for April 15 — the same date was set for Europe release as well, according to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/looks-like-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-could-launch-in-two-weeks?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dhtwitter&utm_content=null">Netherland-based report</a>. However, while the specific reason for the launch postponement is still unclear, the re-adjustment of the launch date wasn't due to quality concerns but rather due to some internal changes, that happened in the Samsung team, especially in the business department.</p><p>Meanwhile, another reliable tipster Ice Universe on X has also shared the same news of postponement in his latest X post.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What I want to say is this bad news: the release of Samsung S25 edge has been postponed. It was originally scheduled to be released on the 15th of this month, but now it has been postponed to May or June.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1907313487283728552">April 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is a highly anticipated device launch of this year, and there seem to be various takeaways for the device even before it is released to the masses. It is one of the slimmest devices that Samsung has ever made, which translates to measuring 5.8mm in thickness.</p><p>The display, however, is expected to be the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> measuring 6.7 inches. Underneath, the S25 Edge is likely powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> same as the flagship trio.</p><p>The device is also expected to come in three colorways — Sliver, Black, and Blue. The ultra slim phone is also touted to be coming in 256GB and 512GB storage options and further have at least 12GB of RAM. Ahead of the launch, we also got to see a good look at how the device would look like in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-shows-off-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-in-titanium-variants">recent renders</a> that showed up on the web.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 FE series is here, bringing both a base model and a Plus version into the mix. Sticking with their Fan Edition lineup, these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">mid-range tablets</a> aim to offer solid bang for your buck, much like last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE</a> series.</p><p>The big upgrades are a larger display and some built-in AI smarts. Powered by Samsung’s Exynos 1580, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series is a step-up from its predecessors in terms of AI capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="ai-upgrades-2">AI upgrades</h2>
<p>You’re getting Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> for quick info on the fly, smarter Samsung Notes that can solve math problems and clean up your handwriting, and upgraded editing tools like an improved Object Eraser and the new Best Face feature.</p><p>There’s also Auto Trim for effortless video highlights and a dedicated Galaxy AI Hot Key on the Book Cover Keyboard for instant AI access.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.60%;"><img id="ad2EhdDFPHQ5PSwKkbE9mG" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-FE-Book-Cover-Keyboard-Slim" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 FE Book Cover Keyboard Slim in black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ad2EhdDFPHQ5PSwKkbE9mG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3132" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from those AI perks, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series sticks to pretty standard specs.</p><p>Samsung is playing it safe with the Tab S10 FE’s design. You’re looking at the same aluminum body, chunky bezels, and a magnetic S Pen snap-on from previous models.</p>
<h2 id="the-cameras-are-kinda-meh-2">The cameras are kinda meh</h2>
<p>The Tab S10 FE Plus dials it back to just a 13MP rear camera, dropping the 8MP ultrawide from the previous version. Up front, it gets a 12MP camera for selfies or video calls.</p><p>The Plus model also steps it up with a massive 13.1-inch display, which is 12% bigger than before, making it the largest FE tablet yet. It sticks with an IPS LCD panel, which is pretty standard for mid-range tablets, though it won’t match the deep contrast and brightness of those high-end OLED screens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="oJGWFSAmNHeGYcRbCrroAR" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-FE-silver-screen-and-back-panel" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 FE screen and rear panel in silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oJGWFSAmNHeGYcRbCrroAR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the regular Tab S10 FE sticks with the same 10.9-inch screen as last year’s model. At least the screen is clean, with no notches or pinholes messing up your view.</p><p>Both models rock a 90Hz refresh rate and pack Vision Booster tech for better clarity in bright lighting. On top of that, they come with Samsung Knox security and an IP68 rating, meaning they’re built to handle dust, water, and whatever life throws at them.</p><p>The Plus model packs a 10,090mAh battery, which should pair nicely with the Exynos 1580 for solid power efficiency. The regular Tab S10 FE gets an 8,000mAh battery, which is not too shabby either, and likely good for all-day use without hunting for a charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="BDrC24bEw32QyCQG3nHwTY" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-FE-black" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 FE back panel in black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BDrC24bEw32QyCQG3nHwTY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both models support 45W wired charging, so you won’t be stuck waiting forever to power back up.</p><p>Samsung says the tablets arrive on April 10 and will come in three colors: Gray, Silver, and Blue.</p>

On the one hand, I'm disappointed, but on the other, my excitement wants to spiral out of control.</p><p>So why the conflict? Well, according to the renders from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked">@OnLeaks and Android Headlines</a>, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is going to look almost identical to the 9 Pro Fold. Everything from the displays to the cameras, and maybe even the colors, will be the same.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-closed" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a Porcelain color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Recycling designs is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-tired-of-buying-new-cases">same complaint</a> that I've had with the Galaxy Z Fold series over the past three iterations. Minor changes here and there, but really, it's nothing more than just swapping out the chip. All the while, it continues to charge the same amount and points the finger elsewhere to deflect the blame and explain why we're still being charged so much.</p><p>This imaginary line in the sand is where Google apparently decided to step back from. In addition to sharing some renders and specs, we also learned that Google is reportedly considering dropping its next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> to a "lower price point." This, I would argue, is the correct move to make, especially if the only notable change is an upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a>.</p>

<p>For one, we don't actually know how much of an upgrade this G5 will be over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> found in 2024's crop of Google flagships. More importantly (to me at least), it also appears that we may get the same cameras again, which puts me back in the "disappointed" column.</p><p>Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold's cameras</a>, especially the Galaxy Z Fold 6. But the problem is that they aren't the "best" that you can get in a Pixel, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">9 Pro XL</a> is equipped with newer and better hardware than its foldable brethren.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-5.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold rear camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google claims this decision was made to make the 9 Pro Fold as thin as possible. Since the camera bar was replaced with an island, the sensors were just too large for what Google set out to achieve. That being said, I'm still holding out hope that the 10 Pro Fold will at least include an upgraded telephoto lens.</p><p>However, the only reason why I'm not immediately writing off the Pixel 10 Pro Fold for pulling the same crap that Samsung and Apple do is because of the price. We haven't seen or heard specifics yet, and nothing is confirmed until the official launch (so take the latest rumors with a grain of salt), but Google finds itself in a rather unique position.</p><p>It's just Google against Samsung, as OnePlus opted against releasing a rebranded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a>. Meanwhile, Motorola remains focused on challenging Samsung's Z Flip line, forgoing the book-style foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AHwsGURjW4rscnmmvEzM24" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-8.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHwsGURjW4rscnmmvEzM24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If these rumors and renders prove to be real, Google could surprise us all by releasing the Pixel 10 Pro Fold for around $1,500. At least, that's the logical price that comes to mind, as it's usually what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thats-not-a-typo-this-google-pixel-9-pro-deal-from-amazon-makes-black-friday-look-like-a-joke">9 Pro Fold is discounted</a> to when it's on sale. But what if Google went through its entire announcement presentation, and on the last slide, we see "$1,299" for the 10 Pro Fold?</p><p>Is it realistic? No. Is it possible? Oh, it's definitely possible. It's just a matter of profit margins for Google's bottom line. But it would simply be incredible if we ended up with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold being priced the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. And Samsung would never see it coming.</p>

Now, as companies like Google and Apple try to compete, they're starting way behind OpenAI, at least in the eyes of the public. Just how big of a head start does OpenAI have? As of March 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-could-be-set-as-default-assistant">ChatGPT</a> has 700 million monthly active users, which is a staggering total.</p><p>That doesn't mean Google is powerless in the fight against OpenAI for the bulk of consumer-grade AI market share. In the years since ChatGPT was released, Google ramped up AI development first through Bard, later renamed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. While OpenAI's plan to monetize ChatGPT involved making a bunch of early features free and locking advanced ones behind a paywall, Google is doing the opposite.</p><p>With Gemini, Google is almost exclusively developing new features for its paid Gemini Advanced tier, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Those features start out exclusive to the Google One AI Premium plan, which costs $20 per month, but they don't stay there for long. In the case of the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">latest Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model</a>, it only remained a Gemini Advanced perk for a mere four days before going free.</p><p>So, what does this tell us about Google's AI strategy, and is it even worth paying for Gemini Advanced anymore?</p>

<h2 id="why-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-is-already-available-for-free-users-2">Why Gemini 2.5 Pro (Exp) is already available for free users</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.25%;"><img id="uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX" name="Gemini-2.5-Pro" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="627" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChatGPT has a massive brand advantage over Gemini, to the point that some casual users refer to AI as a whole as just "ChatGPT." However, Google has had the technological edge over OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) for some time now. It's releasing new models at a steady bi-annual pace — sometimes quicker — and Google's latest Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model is the highest-scoring in multiple AI benchmarks.</p><p>LMArena, a multifaceted AI benchmark, has Gemini 2.5 Pro ranking first on its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard" target="_blank"> leaderboard</a> — ahead of Grok 3, GPT-4.5, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek R1</a>. Google called it the company's "most intelligent AI model" in its announcement of Gemini 2.5 Pro last week, and independent tests appear to back up those claims.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.13%;"><img id="jT62sfundccz4jwMuZZwWX" name="Gemini-2.5-Benchmarks" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jT62sfundccz4jwMuZZwWX.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="2556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That leads us to why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">Google decided to make Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free</a> on March 29, just four days after it debuted on March 25. To truly take on ChatGPT, Google can't just convince new users to regularly use Gemini. It also has to try and entice current ChatGPT users to switch to Gemini, and the best way to do that isn't to limit the free tier to outdated models — it's to get the absolute best Gemini models in the hands of the most people.</p><p>Although some Gemini Advanced users may have been caught off guard by the short exclusivity period, Google confirmed this is exactly why it made Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free in a social media post.</p><p>"The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap," the company wrote in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1906131622736679332" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> on the Gemini app account. "Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off 🚀🚀🚀

The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap.

Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today.

Try it at no… https://t.co/eqCJwwVhXJ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1906131622736679332">March 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Google's move regarding Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental might seem like a one-off, until you look at past examples of Gemini Advanced features going free. In recent months, numerous paid features have made their way to free users, including Gems — custom versions of Gemini catered to specific tasks. As of March 2025, free users can create their own custom Gemini bots or use pre-made Gems.</p><p>This example is quite important, since it directly challenges OpenAI's custom GPTs. Custom GPTs work similarly to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-let-you-share-custom-gems-for-gemini-in-the-mobile-app">Gemini Gems</a>, as they are custom chatbots designed to suit a specific need. However, free ChatGPT users can only try out existing custom GPTs — they can't create their own. Meanwhile, we know that Google is offering similar functionality completely free with Gemini.</p><p>The list of paid Gemini Advanced features made available to free users includes document upload and analysis, image generation of people, Deep Research, and Saved info. Once again, it's worth noting that ChatGPT's version of Deep Research isn't free, potentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deep-research-could-be-the-next-gemini-feature-to-hit-free-users-per-report">making the Gemini equivalent a more appealing option</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n7fwxQaHoVkMWiPGLvob7B" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-13.jpg" alt="Google Gemini app on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n7fwxQaHoVkMWiPGLvob7B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google's strategy regarding Gemini is clear: the company wants to deliver more free features than its competitors, all while embedding AI into its existing services — like Google Search, Android, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/march-2025-workspace-feature-drop">Workspace</a>, and YouTube — to gain a competitive edge. But where does that leave Gemini Advanced subscribers?</p><p>Surprisingly, there are still plenty of reasons to subscribe to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> for Gemini Advanced access. For starters, Advanced users won't hit rate limits as early as free users. Even if the same models are available to free and paid accounts, Gemini Advanced users will get higher token counts for a larger context window.</p><p>With Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental, paying customers get a one-million-token context window that will expand to two million in the future.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX" name="Gemini-Pro-tokens.jpg" alt="Google Gemini Pro's new token count" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A key perk of Gemini Advanced is the higher token support. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's in addition to all the other Gemini Advanced features that are still exclusive to the subscription, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">NotebookLM</a> — one of the most powerful AI note-taking and research tools available. The same goes for Gemini Live with screen sharing and live video streaming, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-rolling-out-video-and-screen-sharing-support-for-gemini-live">rolling out to supported Android devices now</a>.</p><p>Google's shocking move of making Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free just days after its release underscores how important Gemini's unpaid tier is to the company's AI strategy. Somehow, it doesn't come at the expense of Gemini Advanced, either.</p>

For the longest time, scrolling through apps in the app drawer could only be done horizontally, and there was no way to change this other than using a third-party launcher or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>. Vertical scrolling feels more natural in my opinion, and is the layout most other manufacturers choose to go with.</p><p>Finally, after years of wanting this feature, Samsung has given users a choice in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>. If you've bought one of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> phones or have updated your older phone to One UI 7, here's how you can change to a vertical scrolling app drawer.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-to-a-vertical-scrolling-app-drawer-on-one-ui-7-2">How to change to a vertical scrolling app drawer on One UI 7</h2>
<p>1. Unlock your phone and open the app drawer.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>three vertical dots</strong> in the Search box at the bottom, and choose <strong>Sort</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Alphabetical order</strong>.</p><p>4. That's it! Your app drawer has been switched to vertical scrolling. When doing it the first time, you'll see an overlay message alerting you to the change in swiping style.</p>

<h2 id="do-more-with-one-ui-7-on-your-samsung-phone-2">Do more with One UI 7 on your Samsung phone</h2>
<p>One UI 7 is the latest smartphone software from Samsung, and it comes pre-installed on the Galaxy 25 series. The interface gets a tweaked design, and there are more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features to play with, some exclusive to the S25 series. The official rollout of One UI 7 for older devices has hit a bit of a snag and didn't make it as promised in the first quarter of 2025. Samsung is still issuing new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-6-galaxy-s24-appears">beta versions of One UI 7 for Galaxy S24</a> owners as we wait for the final build in early April.</p><p>There's not much anyone can do about it, but wait for it. Releasing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-7-delayed-because-software-is-hard">software updates is hard</a>, especially when you're Samsung and have more than a hundred models, each with its own variants based on where it's sold in the world. Plenty of due diligence is needed to make sure everything works across its entire portfolio, and rushing a half-baked update will only make things worse.</p><p>New features in One UI 7 that you can expect to arrive on older flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>. Now Bar sits at the bottom of your lockscreen and shows you updates on ongoing activities like music that's playing, live notifications, timers, and more. Now Brief on the other hand offers more detailed personalized briefings based on relevant information. Other features that will cross over include cross-app action, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a>, Auto Trim, and AI Drawing Assist.</p>

While many of the new changes have been well-received by users and beta testers, there's one exception: the split notification shade and quick settings panel.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-7-delayed-because-software-is-hard">One UI 7</a> now behaves like iOS, with a notification shade that can be accessed by swiping down from the left corner of the screen and a separate quick settings panel on the right. For longtime One UI users, this could be a negative change that impacts muscle memory. The good news is that it's easy to reverse the split notification shade and quick settings panel to the unified panel. Let's find out how.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-notification-and-quick-settings-options-in-one-ui-7-2">All the notification and quick settings options in One UI 7</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-split-notification-shade" alt="The new split notification pane on One UI 7 beta 2 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One UI 7 offers two customization options for the notification shade and quick settings panel: <strong>separate</strong> and <strong>together</strong>. Separate is now the default, with together still available as a manual option.</p><p>With the single notification shade and quick settings panel, you can view your most recent notifications and the top level quick settings toggles. There's also an option to edit the top quick settings so that your most-used toggles are easily accessible. To see them all, you can swipe down from the top quick settings one more time.</p><p>While you might expect the option to switch between these preferences to be in the Settings app, it's actually in the panel itself.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-back-to-a-single-notification-and-quick-settings-panel-2">How to change back to a single notification and quick settings panel</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Open the Quick Settings menu</strong> by swiping down from the top-right corner of the screen.</p><p>2. Press the <strong>Pencil</strong> icon.</p><p>3. Look for the <strong>Panel settings</strong> button at the top left of your screen, and tap it.</p><p>4. Under <strong>Panel settings</strong> options, tap <strong>Together</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K2kjttJmqNuQtH9VAqbq6Z" name="Quick-Settings-One-UI-Steps" alt="Steps for changing the Quick Settings menu's location." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K2kjttJmqNuQtH9VAqbq6Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After that, you'll now see your notification shade and quick settings menu on the same screen. This reflects how previous versions of One UI handled the two, so you're essentially reverting the new One UI 7 default.</p>

<p>Whether you simply prefer a unified notification shade and quick settings panel or are used to the old One UI defaults, there are plenty of reasons to change the One UI 7 preference. A single notification shade and quick settings panel is a One UI staple, and it's one of the things that separates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a> from iPhones.</p><p>Although some users might be unhappy with the switch, it's great that Samsung provides users with a choice between the two options. You can try out both the split and unified panel and choose the one that you like best on One UI 7.</p>

<hr>
<p>Early signs that Samsung's next watch line up have surfaced in a new leak. While we were focused on Samsung's upcoming foldable line up, the next-gen watches may have quietly passed safety checks.</p><p>Details surrounding batteries that are meant for the next Galaxy Watch 8 series' have allegedly received the SafetyKorea certification and in a separate leak, another tipster on X seems to have spotted firmware builds for these wearables, but more on this later. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-batteries-safetykorea-certification/">XpertPick</a>, the next generation of the Galaxy Watch will include two models: the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Galaxy Watch 8 classic.</p><p>First off, two batteries with the codenames <em>EB-BL330ABY and EB-BL505ABY</em>, have been approved by the SafetyKorea authority— as seen in the screenshots below. The publication seems to think that these batteries could be associated with the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>XpertPick also got its hands on the safety certification, indicating that Samsung has sent two products under "Fitness authentication" for safety and compliance certification.</p>

<p>A screenshot posted by XpertPick also spilled beans on the battery capacity of one of these wearables. "The TUV certification has revealed that the EB-BL330ABY battery has a typical capacity of 435mAh." However, we do not have any information on the battery size of the EB-BL505ABY variant.</p><p>Corroborating the fact that the Galaxy Watch 8 series will come as a pair, a user on X revealed information on the supposed firmware that will be built into these wearables. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theordysm"><strong>Theordysm</strong></a> spotted model numbers <em>SM-L320, SM-L325U, SM-L330, and SM-L335U, </em>which could hint at the different size variants of the Galaxy Watch 8. While <em>SM-L500 and SM-L505 </em>could be associated with the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic variant.</p>

<p>This is the first time we've heard the mention of the Galaxy Watch 8 series in the rumor mill in quite some time. So far, all we've heard was that future Galaxy Watch models, such as the Watch 8, could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">ditching the circular design</a> for a more Apple Watch-like squircle look.</p><p>We also sense that this year's watch could bring all the features that didn't make the cut on the Galaxy Watch 7 series, like the rumored blood-glucose monitoring that Samsung claimed to be developing "as early as the second half of 2024," despite previous reports that blood glucose monitoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">would take a few years to arrive</a>.</p><p>That said, the new Galaxy Watch 8 series is expected to debut later this year along with Samsung's  Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 at its summer Unpacked event, the publication added.

<hr>
<p>Google and Samsung marketed Gemini Live's new Project Astra features as coming to the latest Pixel and Galaxy phones first, but actual compatibility will work with a much wider set of Android devices. An updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15274899#:~:text=Share%20your%20camera%20or%20screen%20with%20Live" target="_blank">support document</a> from Google confirms that Gemini Live's video streaming and screen sharing features will work on any Android device running Android 10.0 or newer (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/01/gemini-live-camera-any-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The features still require Gemini Advanced, which costs $20 per month as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>. Aside from that requirement, there are no other limitations for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> features, which are rolling out to devices now.</p><p>"For now, the features below are available on any Android device with Gemini Advanced," the support document reads. "These features are being released gradually, so they might not be available to you just yet."</p><p>Reading between the lines, we can decipher that Gemini Live's video capabilities will work on Android phone, tablet, or foldable running Android 10.0 or higher. The Gemini Advanced requirement means that Android devices must support the Gemini app, which is limited to devices running Android 10 and up.</p>

<p>This includes a wide range of devices, meaning that Gemini's new Project Astra features aren't limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>. With that being said, Google's "for now" qualifier in the support document suggests this could change in the future.</p>

<p>The upcoming Gemini Live features have already hit some Gemini Advanced users, but the rollout is slow thus far. Live video streaming and screen sharing support was first previewed as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">Project Astra</a>, a research project demoed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>. Then, it underwent public beta testing at the end of last year, and a final version was shown off at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC Barcelona 2025</a>.</p><p>Soon, all Gemini Advanced users will be able to go live with Gemini, sharing their surroundings or device screen for additional context.</p>

<ul><li>Code references in the Google app for Android hint that Google could be working on a kid-friendly Gemini version.</li><li>Google already has guardrails in place for teens using Gemini.</li><li>These hints appear as Google rolls out new kid-friendly features, like Google Wallet for kids.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been steadily rolling out new and improved versions of kid and parent-friendly features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gives-family-link-a-new-look-and-plans-new-supervision-tools">a fresh look for Family Link</a>. The next Google service to get an experience optimized for children might be Gemini, the company's AI chatbot. According to an APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-for-kids-apk-teardown-3540211/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, multiple code strings referenced a version of Gemini made for kids.</p><p>The code strings were spotted in <strong>version 16.12.39</strong> of the Google app for Android, which is where new Gemini features often appear before making their way to the Gemini app. The references include mentions of a welcome screen for kid users, as well as descriptions of key features. You can view the full code strings below:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name="assistant_scrappy_welcome_screen_title_for_kid_users">Switch to Gemini from Google Assistant</string>
<string name="assistant_welcome_screen_description_for_kid_users">Create stories, ask questions, get homework help, and more.</string>
<string name="assistant_welcome_screen_footer_for_kid_users">Google &lt;a href=%1$s&gt;Terms&lt;/a&gt; apply. Google will process your data as described in the &lt;a href=%2$s&gt;Google Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=%3$s&gt;Gemini Apps Privacy Notice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Gemini isn&amp;#8217;t human and can make mistakes, including about people, so double-check it.&lt;/b&gt;</string>
<string name="assistant_welcome_screen_title_for_kid_users">Meet Gemini, Google’s AI for everyone</string></code></pre>
<p>In particular, one string lists the description of Gemini for kids as helping them "Create stories, get homework help, and more." The strings also include standard notices that Gemini can make mistakes, and that kids' data will be processed per Google's privacy policy and Gemini's Apps Privacy Notice.</p><p>Although Gemini can already help kids with things like homework, it's likely that a future "Gemini for kids" version could include more guardrails and an experience tailored to children. Currently, Google already has certain safeguards in place for younger users, as explained in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/policy-guidelines/?hl=en" target="_blank">Gemini policy guidelines</a>.</p><p>"For teens, we enforce even stricter content policies and default protections to help prevent age-inappropriate content, such as content related to illegal or age-gated substances," Google says. "Teens are automatically onboarded to Gemini with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unPKJJjQP0A" target="_blank"><u>helpful video</u></a> that shares simple tips for using AI responsibly."</p><p>It's also possible that a "Gemini for kids" experience could be optimized for younger children than teens. For now, details are slim, as Google hasn't confirmed plans for a kid-friendly version of Gemini. However, it's worth noting that the company has rolled out many child-friendly features of late, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/kids-with-android-phones-can-now-tap-and-pay-with-google-wallet">Google Wallet for kids</a>.</p>

<p>Before that, Google and Samsung collaborated to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-and-google-teamed-up-on-new-galaxy-watch-7-experience-for-kids">Galaxy Watch for Kids</a> experience. On a similar note, Google sells the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a>, a kid-friendly smartwatch.</p><p>As such, it wouldn't be a surprise for Google to make a version of Gemini just for kids.</p>

<hr>
<p>Not all April Fool's pranks are a lost cause. OnePlus took this opportunity to tease its upcoming smaller phone set to join the OnePlus 13 line up, in an April Fools Day video.</p><p>In a post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5150568143916360#&video">Weibo</a>, OnePlus seems to have confirmed that its long-rumored OnePlus 13T, or as most people call it, the OnePlus 13 Mini, will arrive "later this month."</p><p>OnePlus uploaded a video where it revealed a Thor-like hammer (Mjolnir) as its new product. The presenter seemed to have summoned the hammer on stage and explained its tech powers — obviously hopping on the April Fool's train.</p><p>However, at the end of the video, OnePlus seemingly teased its OnePlus 13T with a poster that shows the signature OnePlus red box and font that closely translates to "Small, beautiful and powerful OnePlus 13T, see you this month.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="Br8iZrzqJ74hAEc2AHWFsP" name="oneplus-13t-teaser-1" alt="screenshot of the OnePlus 13T teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Br8iZrzqJ74hAEc2AHWFsP.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the caption of the video on Weibo states that the company will bring back the T-series device with "Top performance, in your hands." OnePlus added that the phone will be an "unprecedented technology product, refreshing your understanding of small and powerful!" This hints that the device could come packed with performance and AI features from the standard OnePlus 13 lineup.</p><p>While the video didn't show us what this device would look like, we have a some idea of what to expect based on recent leaks. Just last month, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-oneplus-13t-just-inched-closer-to-launch-with-fresh-details-surfacing">OnePlus 13T surfaced</a>, labeled as PKX110, but it only revealed that the device will come with 80W fast charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BJRg4cA6h7TUHmpwJB4qF7" name="OnePlus-10T-back-black-02.jpg" alt="The back of the OnePlus 10T Moonstone Black colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BJRg4cA6h7TUHmpwJB4qF7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other leaks suggest the device could sport a smaller 6.3-inch 1.5K flat OLED display and will be powered by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite"> Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite </a>chip, along with a 6,000mAh battery, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The device's cameras allegedly include a 50MP main sensor and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. Details about the selfie camera are still unknown. However, the rear camera placement could shift into the vertical array this time around.</p><p>OnePlus is finally bringing back its T-series device after three years when the OnePlus 10T launched in 2022. While we aren't sure how much this phone will cost, it could fall somewhere in between the $600-$900 mark, based on the 13R and the OnePlus 13's cost.</p><p>While the company didn't reveal a launch date for this device, the announcement suggests that the wait won't be long, as the company could continue to drop more hints as the month progresses.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-67">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Several Google Pixel report threads state a few past-gen devices are suffering from inaccurate weather forecasts via the Pixel weather widget.</li><li>Users state the widget is displaying the correct temperature; however, the forecast throughout the day belongs to a previous day.</li><li>Some believe there's a desync issue that is simply not rectifying itself as users have suffered these issues for the past few days.</li><li>Following the March feature drop, Pixel users have suffered from various issues ranging from odd screen brightness to disappearing alarms.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's weather widget is causing some confusion for Pixel users following a recent string of oddities.</p><p>As usual, Pixel owners took to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jn30ns/how_many_others_are_getting_1day_old_weather/?rdt=51996">respective subreddit</a> to start voicing issues, which reportedly include day-old weather forecasts (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixels-weather-widget-stuck-in-the-past/">Android Police</a>). The issue seemed to be quite persistent for the original poster of the thread on Reddit; however, other subsequent user reports expand on it. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jn30ns/comment/mkgs35i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user responded</a> by saying their Pixel has been delivering inaccurate weather forecasts "for the past three days."</p><p>Another user, who also reported the issue a couple of days ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jlu1uf/google_weather_at_a_glance_temperature_forecast/">states this issue</a> has been consistent on Pixels running Android 13, 14, and 15. Of course, this concerns devices with the "At a glance" weather information readily available. The user says the current temperature is correct, but "the expected high/low forecast hasn't been correct in the past week."</p><p>Then, strangely, opening the Pixel weather app fully displays everything as it should be. It's an odd back and forth between accurate temps to inaccurate forecasts, which only solve themselves when opening the full app.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jlu1uf/google_weather_at_a_glance_temperature_forecast">Google Weather At A Glance Temperature Forecast - Never Accurate</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Users have reported these issues on Pixel 7 devices and a Pixel 8a, as seen in a Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/334229425/pixel-8a-lock-screen-showing-weather-forecast-for-the-wrong-day?hl=en">community thread</a>. The post states the user had observed inaccurate weather forecasts, which showed the wrong day, on their lock screen. The user details the problem, stating, "In the morning, it shows yesterday's forecast as the temperature 'today,' and in the evening, it shows today's forecast as the weather 'tomorrow.'"</p><p>The problem doesn't appear to involve the Pixel 9 series, but you never know. It's something to keep an eye on as Google has yet to officially acknowledge the issue. As some users suspect, it <em>could </em>be an odd sync issue with the Pixel weather app widget. Hopefully, it begins to solve itself to avoid further confusion.</p>

<p>There's been no shortage of troubles for Google's Pixels as, following its March feature drop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">major issues have been appearing</a>. Pixel 7 to Pixel 9 series owners were reportedly suffering from brightness fluctuations, audio issues, and vibration problems following the big update. Google responded to those issues, stating it was aware and looking into the problem, as well as offering some temporary solutions.</p><p>Elsewhere, Pixel owners were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported">getting to a late start</a> last week as their alarms were deactivating themselves. Scheduled alarms were simply disappearing, leaving many users late for work without realizing their Pixel did it on its own. Some blame the March feature drop, while others think it was Gemini.</p><p>It's unclear if the same major patch is the culprit for the recent Pixel weather problems. There's a chance Google may have to fix some things on its end for those affected.</p>

<hr>
<p>A recent report suggests Samsung is looking into a new type of battery technology for its next smart ring.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.mt.co.kr/mtview.php?no=2025040113515370007">Money Today</a> (Korean) claims Samsung will apply an "all-solid-state battery" technology inside the next Galaxy Ring (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-plans-all-solid-state-batteries-for-wearables-like-galaxy-ring/">SammyGuru</a>). The publication states this tech, dubbed the "Dream Battery," consists of "solid electrolytes," which reportedly reduces the "risk of fire." However, there are two important sides to this type of battery. The first is positive, as all-solid-state batteries are said to hold more energy for devices.</p><p>In theory (and if true), this might give the next Galaxy Ring a longer battery life — though it can already last <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review#section-battery-and-charging:~:text=My%20Galaxy%20Ring%20lasted%206%2D7%20full%20days%20on%20any%20given%20charge.">roughly a week</a>. The report speculates that Samsung could take the battery's maximum energy capacity even higher when it looks to (potentially) bring it to the second Galaxy Ring.</p><p>The second is its application. Rumors claim that implementing this new battery technology into the next Galaxy Ring could drive up its cost. The post highlights that manufacturing such a battery is "much more" expensive than settling for a lithium-ion alternative. What's more, the poor performance of the Galaxy Ring sales-wise is supposedly a hurdle Samsung is still paying attention to when considering this battery type.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9wPj8zFQaSiTVnHX45ETkj" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-in-case" alt="Samsung Galaxy Ring in charging case with lid open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9wPj8zFQaSiTVnHX45ETkj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For now, Samsung is rumored to apply prototypes of this tech to the next Galaxy Ring "in the fourth quarter this year." Meanwhile, the report's alleged sources claim Samsung will also look to bring these dream batteries to earbuds in 2026 and a future Galaxy Watch in "late 2027."</p><p>Regarding Samsung's popularity concerns, when the Galaxy Ring launched last summer (July), the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-cant-ship-the-galaxy-ring-fast-enough-shows-how-theyre-an-in-thing">struggled to keep up</a> with demand. A report showed the Galaxy Ring sold out in just a few days prior to its official reveal/launch during Unpacked. When pre-orders opened again, the company had to deliver longer wait times for certain sizes as they weren't readily available. While this lasted for a few weeks during the summer, as the Korean publication highlights, it didn't last long.</p><p>As consumers got over the initial hype, and likely as more reviews came to light, things quieted.</p><p>Galaxy Ring 2 rumors have been scarce, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-2-new-enhancements-launch-rumored">one claimed</a> in November that Samsung could provide it with an increased battery life and a thinner profile. It's remained unknown just how thin the ring could be next time. Elsewhere, it seems Samsung is looking to bring even more features to its next smart ring as the original may have felt a little lackluster.</p><p>It's also unclear when Samsung could debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">the next Galaxy Ring</a>; however, we're hopeful that something shows up during its summer Unpacked this year.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is highlighting a new challenge for users in London looking to take the tube throughout April.</p><p>Transport for London (Tfl) and Google Pay have joined together to bring the "Tube Challenge" to London. According to a press release, the event runs from March 31 through April 30. The company says users are eligible to win prizes and badges when using Google Pay for Android specifically. In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://madeby.tfl.gov.uk/2025/03/31/google-pay-tube-challenge/">blog post</a>, the Tfl explains how users can get started this month.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-2">Getting Started</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="eFDFBPhyetzjofs4GMQ4QJ" name="google-pay-tlf-london-tube-challenge-collect" alt="Google Pay joins the Tfl is bringing the "Tube Challenge" to users in London." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFDFBPhyetzjofs4GMQ4QJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1197" height="673" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The post states users in London will have a chance to join the challenge from within Google Wallet. The Tfl encourages you to attach your Visa or Mastercard to the app "and start tapping in and out with Google Pay on your adventures."</p><p>These digital badges you're playing for will be collected as you tap to pay at various Tube stations. Google says travelers can collect these badges from all 272 Tube stations, including the 41 Elizabeth line stations. Alongside these badges are some fun facts about every station you may visit.</p><p>That's not all; as Google states train riders engaging with Google Pay for the Tube challenge are also entered into a weekly competition to win Santander Cycles Day Passes. However, during the final week, users tapping in and out of London stations will be eligible to win a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>. Remember: you earn an entry into these two raffles every day you take the Tube and engage with Google Pay.</p>

<p>In a statement, the customer director at the Tfl, Emma Strain, said, "We are excited to partner with Google Pay on their ‘Tube Challenge’ within Google Wallet. This innovative challenge offers customers a fun and engaging way to explore the Tube and Elizabeth line network, collect digital station badges, and learn facts about the places they are travelling to across London."</p><p>It's worth remembering that the Google Pay app — on its own — is no more, as the company shuttered it and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-supports-42-additional-banks">packed it into Google Wallet</a>. The app was officially shuttered as of June 4, 2024. The idea of paying via Google Pay still exists as its core functions are within Google Wallet. Additionally, places will still say they accept payment via the method, so it's not gone; it's just been moved.</p><p>To get people ready, Google brought support for a host of banks to its Wallet app early last year. Many of them were small banks, but the idea was likely to include as many of its users as possible to make the transition smooth. Since then, the company (in the U.S.) has moved to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">digital ID support for state IDs</a>.</p><p>California <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-id-support-in-yet-another-us-state">joined the movement</a>, as well as Arizona, Georgia, and a few others.</p>

The new Galaxy A36 5G might be the answer, boasting (nearly) flagship-level specs and clocking in at just $399.99.

<p>Surely destined to earn a spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> released this year, the Samsung Galaxy A36 5G impresses with a stunning 6.7-inch AMOLED display that boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, while the 5,000mAh battery will easily last a full day on a single charge. </p><p>You&apos;ll also enjoy solid performance from the Exynos chipset, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, and a pared-down version of Galaxy AI (known as "Awesome Intelligence", per Samsung). Furthermore, the Galaxy A36 5G comes with six years of guaranteed software updates, which is a first for Samsung&apos;s budget-minded A series. </p><p>Priced in between Samsung&apos;s flagships and even-cheaper models like the Galaxy A16, one could argue that the A36 5G suffers from a bit of middle child syndrome. After all, if you&apos;re willing to spend a bit more, you could get an arguably better phone like the OnePlus 13R, the upcoming Pixel 9a, or even the Galaxy S25 (with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">right phone deal</a>). But if you&apos;re already a fan of Samsung&apos;s bestselling A series and you want a new phone right away, this deal could get you exactly what you need (plus a free gift card to boot).</p>

<ul><li>New leak purports that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will launch this month.</li><li>The information comes from a Dutch website that also showcased model numbers for different storage variants of the device.</li><li>The publication was able to track down accessories that are being prepped for the sleek Galaxy phone that seems to be on everyone's mind.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> has been at the centre of several leaks recently and for good reason, it looks like. A Dutch website seems to have gotten its hands on when this device could potentially see the light of day.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/041212/24519/Exclusief-Dit-is-de-lanceerdatum-van-de-Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge.html">NieuweMobiel.NL</a> (Netherlands website), the sleek phone will allegedly launch on April 15 in Europe — a day earlier than what the previous leaks have been pointing to. Additionally, the publication stated that the phone will be released in three colorways and two storage variants while also listing their supposed model numbers:</p><p><em>256GB Silver: SM-S937BZSD</em></p><p><em>512GB Silver: SM-S937BZSG</em></p><p><em>256GB Black: SM-S937BZKD</em></p><p><em>512GB Black: SM-S937BZKG</em></p><p><em>256GB Blue: SM-S937BLBD</em></p><p><em>512GB Blue: SM-S937BLBG</em></p><p>According to NieuweMobeil.NL, all S25 Edge models come with 12GB of RAM, similar to the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GqsKf64SdjS5S3RWb4DWAD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-Colorways" alt="Titanium colorways of Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqsKf64SdjS5S3RWb4DWAD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WinFuture)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Recently, we got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-shows-off-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-in-titanium-variants" target="_blank">good peek</a> at those colorways as official-looking renders popped up on the internet. They show off the Galaxy S25 Edge in a Titanium build and the three colors that match the Galaxy S25 Ultra: "Titanium Jet Black," "Titanium Silver," and "Titanium Icy Blue."</p><p>Samsung wasn't being too secretive about the upcoming addition to the S25 series since it openly showed off the device first at this year's Unpacked and later more vividly at the MWC in Barcelona, where the phones were hung from the ceiling suspended by metallic ropes.</p><p>We now know what the phone will look like, however when it comes to the specs of the phone, here's what we know so far. To start, the Galaxy S25 Edge is said to be 5.84mm thin, showcasing a titanium body and an Armor Aluminum frame. The phone could have a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>.</p><p>Additionally, it is said to come with a smaller 3,900mAh battery compared to the rest of the Galaxy S25 series (with some rumors pointing to a 4,000mAh unit), although we won't know for sure until it launches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4093px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AbNKAdLaHp9MFRMAf8UzE4" name="Samsung-GAlaxy-S25-Edge-MWC-2025-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbNKAdLaHp9MFRMAf8UzE4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4093" height="2302" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As seen in several images, the phone will have two rear cameras. They will likely consist of a primary 200MP lens and a 12MP lens for ultra-wide shots, along with a selfie camera, which we don't have much information about.</p><p>When it comes to protecting these expensive phones, the Dutch website dropped some images of accessories that the Korean OEM is expected to release. The news website was able to find two Galaxy S25 Edge cases — a silicone case and a Kindsuit Case that showcased several color variations, with their supposed model numbers: <strong>Samsung EF-PS937CJ Silicone Case S25 Edge Gray </strong>and <strong>Samsung EF-VS937PL Kindsuit Case S25 Edge Blue</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1172px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:85.32%;"><img id="L8ocQeeJgw4gUhRNL7jr4N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-Cases" alt="Cases of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L8ocQeeJgw4gUhRNL7jr4N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1172" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NieuweMobiel.NL)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We also hear that the phones could be on the expensive side, with the 256GB model costing €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400), while the 512GB version might hit €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520).</p><p>As we near launch, the leaks seem to be coming in hot. However, it is important to note that everything we see in leaks may or may not show up on the actual device. If the Dutch website's information holds true, then the wait isn't for much longer.</p>

<p>As I pulled the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra out of my pocket, an unfamiliar friction met my fingers. This wasn't the matte glass texture that I'm used to feeling from Samsung's latest flagship. No, instead, was it the coarse texture of a brush or, dare I suggest it, <em>turf grass</em>?</p><p>Indeed, it was the feeling of the latest DBrand skin drop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/touch-grass"><strong>Touch Grass</strong></a>, which allows you to place your very own little field of dreams on your favorite device. The company says over 100 devices are supported for this limited edition drop, and while it is an April Fool's joke of sorts, DBrand is actually selling this limited edition set of skins to willing customers (so get it while it lasts!).</p><p>Given how much I've loved Dbrand's previous limited edition drops — like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dbrand-leather-skin-review">the leather one</a> — I couldn't pass up the opportunity to touch grass and see how it felt, so I got a pack for a few phones in my possession and hastily installed them. If you're a nerd who's ever been told to "touch grass," this might be the perfect opportunity without having to go outside to do it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9gKi4p9Df2nQKZsMGQHYbf" name="dbrand-grass-skin-2025-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-05" alt="The green Touch Grass DBrand skin on the back of a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gKi4p9Df2nQKZsMGQHYbf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite the unique texture, the DBrand Touch Grass skin installs the same way as any other DBrand skin. You'll use the included microfiber cloth to wipe off any grease or smudges on the back of your phone, peel off a portion of the 3M paper on the back of the grass skin, align it with the camera modules, and then slowly peel back the rest of the 3M paper as you press the skin's adhesive back onto the phone's glass surface.</p><p>Unlike some of the full-coverage skins, the Touch Grass skin doesn't require a hair dryer for application. Instead, you'll just use the included microfiber cloth to rub the edges 15-20 times until they "melt" into the edge. This works particularly well with any phone that has a flat back and a slightly raised lip around the edge, as it'll help conceal the edge of the skin so you don't accidentally peel it off with a fingernail.</p>

<p>The skin is thicker than most DBrand skins because of the raised grass texture, which comprises thousands of electrostatically flocked polyethylene strands. Dbrand told me that flocking — a process that "shoots hyper-thin strands into adhesive and has them stand up like actual grass" — was the only method the company could find to fit the vision for the product properly.</p><p>"There were definitely 'fuzz' alternatives that we took one look at and abandoned. They were more akin to moss than they were actual strands of grass," DBrand CEO Adam Ijaz told me.</p>

<p>A mixture of green and yellow colors scattered throughout gives it a strangely natural look on the back of a wholly synthetic device, and it adds some <strong>serious</strong> grip to an otherwise slippery glass and metal sandwich of a phone.</p><p>The coarse grass texture reminds me quite a bit of one of those little brushes you use to clean the underside of your fingernails. It's not unpleasantly coarse but it does have a texture that could be irritating to sensitive skin. This isn't soft, natural spring grass. Thankfully, DBrand has ensured that it's a dry-feeling texture, not the slimy plastic you might be familiar with when you hear "turf grass."</p>

<p>As it has a significantly grippier texture than matte glass, this one will hold fast in your pocket even if you decide to do a handstand. How do I know that? I did it, of course. It'll also probably make your pocket go inside out every time you pull it out, especially if you wear shorts or pants with mesh pockets.</p>

<p>So this skin can finally make phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> <em>not slippery</em>, but what else can it do? Eliminate wobble on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. One of the worst smartphone trends in recent years is the obnoxiously large camera lenses that are placed off-center on the back of phones. That makes them wobble when you put them down on a table.</p><p>But this skin completely fixes that, and it even makes it so the phone doesn't slide off a slightly slanted surface. As you might expect, adding the Touch Grass skin will make it impossible to use a case with your phone. If this is a concern, DBrand has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip">its own line of cases</a> that are built to be used with its skins, as you'll put the skin <em>on the case</em> instead of your phone.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">I hate glass phones</a>. I'm not sure what genius thought covering a smartphone in breakable glass was a good idea, but here we are. Sure, it made things like waterproofing and wireless charging easier for a time, but those days are behind us, and I hope to see more phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> that recognize this.</p><p>Motorola's entire lineup, from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review" target="_blank">$200 Moto G 2025</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review" target="_blank">$999 Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, is clad in different grades of "vegan leather." Vegan leather can be made of anything from pieces of plastic to cactus leaves, each base material giving the final product a different texture. Phones like the Spring Green Razr 2024 or the Midnight Ocean OnePlus 13 use a very soft, cloth-like texture that feels less like leather and more like a suede shoe.</p><p>I definitely prefer that sort of smooth texture as it not only provides much-needed grip to modern phone designs but also removes a breakable surface. These phones don't use some kind of skin adhered to a layer of glass. Instead, this texture is factory-applied to a non-glass backplate and tucked behind the side frame, ensuring it will never peel off. These have also proven to be just as durable, if not more durable, than glass over time, earning phones like the OnePlus 13 a rare IP69 water and dust ingress rating.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Manufacturers are finally ditching glass and using interesting textures like vegan leather that have proven more durable over time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As for DBrand's limited edition Touch Grass skin, Ijaz ensured me that it was made for daily wear and tear.</p><p>"The biggest one was definitely around durability - especially at the edges. Early in development, we found that our traditional die-cutting method produced clean lines but led to grass strands gradually shedding from the edges (think: receding hairline).</p><p>To solve this, we switched to laser cutting. The laser's heat effectively melts (cauterizes) and seals the polyethylene strands at the perimeter, bonding them together to prevent shedding over time. Additionally, embedding each strand securely into an adhesive base layer (covering about 25% of its height) was critical in ensuring long-term stability. Balancing the novelty factor with real-world usability was an interesting challenge, but we're pleased with how well it turned out."</p><p>Of course, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">with some other things</a>, some of the biggest brand names simply aren't doing anything interesting in this area. The bright side is that if you've got an iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, or Google Pixel phone, you can order a DBrand skin to mostly fix this problem. It might still be glass underneath, but at least the outside won't feel like a slippery, breakable surface anymore when you slap a skin on it.</p>

<h2 id="dbrand-s-april-fools-legacy-2">Dbrand’s April Fools’ legacy</h2>
<p>Dbrand has a history of using April Fools’ Day to drop some pretty wild ideas, and today’s launch is no different. Back in 2022, the company introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/diy-kit?srsltid=AfmBOoqXq7VEa_Ruaow8WjNWKKwej2UJ_Xor2Bd5MXUGDTJ8xCiMi6fA" target="_blank">DIY skins</a>, letting people cut their own vinyl wraps. The "Deluxe" kit came with a 2x3 vinyl sheet, some fancy Japanese tools (a ruler and a knife), and a nearly $100 price tag. Meanwhile, the budget-friendly "Classic" version was just a tiny 1x1 vinyl square for $25. It was perfect for covering, well, not much.</p><p>As for the new grass-like skins, Dbrand says they were actually supposed to drop last April, but making fake grass feel real at a microscopic level turned out to be way harder "than coming up with the product name."</p><p>Bringing this concept to life wasn’t easy, as per the company's press release. Dbrand had to figure out how to electrostatically apply polyethylene fibers and cut them cleanly without making a mess.</p>
<h2 id="remember-that-creepy-skin-phone-case-2">Remember that creepy skin phone case?</h2>
<p>Speaking of weird phone cases, researcher Marc Teyssier from Télécom ParisTech created <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marcteyssier.com/projects/skin-on/" target="_blank">Skin-On</a> back in 2019. It was a creepy but fascinating touch interface that felt like human skin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bqXMVeEfpaWPpMsaKx7L7A" name="Touch-Grass-Xbox" alt="Dbrand Touch Grass skin for Xbox" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bqXMVeEfpaWPpMsaKx7L7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This unsettling innovation lets phones, wearables, and touchpads react to different kinds of touch, making interactions a little too lifelike. The prototype responded to both pressure and touch sensations, but it never made it to market.</p><p>On the other hand, Dbrand takes these wild ideas and turns them into real products—like the Doomsday Kit and The DIY Project. While their approach is full of satire, it leads to actual, purchasable items.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps is streamlining trip details, making the interface cleaner and more focused on key information.</li><li>The ETA now pops up bigger and bolder in a split, left-aligned display, making it the star of the show.</li><li>The redesign is live across all transport modes in version 25.13.06, but it’s server-side, so your experience might differ.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Maps is tightening up the way trip details show up on screen, making everything cleaner and packed with just the right information.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/31/google-maps-directions-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> has spotted a new design in the directions overview, where the color-coded ETA now pops up bigger on a split, left-aligned display. This makes that key information stand out more.</p><p>Before the update, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> crammed all your trip details—including time and distance—into three tight lines at the bottom of the screen. Both the hours and miles got the same plain text treatment, while half the space sat empty like unused trail.</p>
<h2 id="eta-gets-the-spotlight-2">ETA gets the spotlight</h2>
<p>The redesign gives the interface a modern feel with a cleaner information layout. While the distance is still there, it takes a backseat, making room for extra details like the ETA. Now, users can easily see things like fuel efficiency and, most importantly, their expected arrival time.</p><p>Previously, on Android, Google Maps gives a quick look at distance and travel time affected by traffic in the overview. To see more information, like parking or toll costs, you have to either expand the overview or tap the menu. But that’s changing with this update.</p>

<p>The visual redesign rolls out across all transport modes in Google Maps, starting with version 25.13.06. While 9to5Google reports a broad rollout, it’s still activated server-side, so the experience may vary for different users.</p><p>Sure, the new layout takes some getting used to. But comparing the old and new designs shows a clear appreciation for Google's improved look. At the end of the day though, we're all just along for the ride - it's not like Google is giving us a vote in the redesign.</p>

<hr>
<p>Caught you off guard; Nothing is announcing a brand new product reveal that'll give you a bit of nostalgia.</p><p>Today (Apr. 1), Nothing unveiled its latest audio product for its Ear lineup dubbed the Ear 3.5mm. If you've ever felt like you wanted to take a step back to wired earphones that deliver unparallel sound, this could be for you. The Nothing Ear 3.5mm features a jack for its respective port on your smartphone or other eligible device.</p><p>Additionally, the device is boasts Nothing's "signature style" for the in-ear part. Users will notice the company's expected transparent design, as well as a large hoop that's meant to go around your ear to ensure it remains in place. Amazingly, the Nothing Ear 3.5mm features a generous 50mm cable, which means you can get a load of housework done while staying connected.</p><p>Nothing ends its reveal with the tagline "Uninterrupted, untangled, unbelievable freedom."</p>

<p>Nothing didn't provide a market release date nor any information on pre-orders for the Ear 3.5mm —<em><strong>because this isn't a real product! April Fools! </strong></em></p><p>Aside from calling its latest product "beautifully inconvenient," it might've seemed odd that Nothing would — out of nowhere — offer an incredibly lengthy cord attached to the base of its Ear Open.</p><p>If you're looking for some "real" earphones, Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Ear Open</a> buds launched last fall (don't worry, they're wireless) and flaunted a different approach to the earphone design. Nothing opted for an "open" approach to the earbuds, which feature a wide ear loop, designed to go over your ears, not inside. Despite that, Android Central's Tshaka Armstrong said in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">review</a> that the buds surprisingly feature quite a bit of bass.</p><p>In other news, the Nothing OS 3.1 update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3a-3a-pro-essential-key-update-3-1">is rolling out</a> for the  Phone 3a and 3a Pro which adds a major feature to Essential Key. It now works with the camera app, letting users directly save photos to their Essential Space with written or voice notes.</p>

<ul><li>Google could be working on a home screen widget for the Pixel Screenshots app.</li><li>The widget, in its early form, will only display your latest screenshot on the home screen for quick access to sharing or editing.</li><li>Right now, the widget is pretty basic—just one screenshot with no customization or resizing options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly working on a home screen widget for the Pixel Screenshots app, which uses AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">to organize and search your screenshots</a>.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-screenshots-widget-3539965/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the Pixel Screenshots app might soon get widget support. In its early version, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>-exclusive widget would show your latest screenshot right on the home screen. You’ll be able to tap on it to share or edit the image directly.</p><p>The widget is pretty limited for now, though. It just shows one screenshot with no options for customizing the content. You can’t resize it either. Its description, "See the latest screenshot and [its] associated action," really highlights how it's all about quick, fixed access.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-just-storing-screenshots-2">More than just storing screenshots</h2>
<p>For those who haven't come across it yet, the Pixel 9-exclusive Pixel Screenshots is an app that turns your screenshots into something useful. First shown off at the 2024 Made by Google event, it’s since been integrated with various Google apps, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-screenshots-circle-to-search-development-spotted">such as Circle to Search</a>, Gboard, and Google Wallet.</p><p>Thanks to Google's Gemini Nano AI, the app automatically sorts through your screenshots and actually understands what's in them. That means you can search for text, dates, or even specific details across all your saved images.</p><p>Despite this discovery, the latest version of the Pixel Screenshots app doesn’t yet support widgets. However, it’s likely that a future update will bring widget support, along with more features and customization options.</p><p>Even without the widget, the Pixel Screenshots app does more than just store images. Its AI pulls out key data—like text, timestamps, and important details—and organizes them into collections that you can easily manage, filter, or add to.</p>

<ul><li>Google will launch a new battery preservation feature, Battery health assistance, later this year.</li><li>The Google Pixel 9a is the only device currently confirmed to be getting the new feature.</li><li>New devices will be required to use Battery health assistance, but it'll be optional for existing ones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-finally-gets-a-launch-date-">Google's Pixel 9a will hit shelves April 10</a>, packing a significantly-larger battery capacity than its predecessor. However, that's not the only battery upgrade the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> brings along. The Google Pixel 9a will also receive with a new feature called "Battery health assistance," as explained by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15738128?hl=en" target="_blank">support document</a> linked on its Google Store listing (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/31/pixel-battery-health-assistance/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>"Your Pixel 9a will receive a software update that automatically helps manage the long term health and performance of its battery as it ages," the company explains. "This software will adjust the battery’s maximum voltage in stages that start at 200 charge cycles and continue gradually until 1000 charge cycles to help stabilize battery performance and aging."</p><p>For those that are unfamiliar, Pixel phones — like most electronics — use lithium-ion batteries that are consumable components. That means they will degrade over time due to a number of factors, including temperature, charge cycles, and age. Eventually, all lithium-ion batteries will need to be replaced.</p><p>There are steps that can be taken to preserve the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-check-android-phone-battery-health">long-term health of your phone's battery</a> and overall performance, though. These can include intentionally throttling a device's performance to accommodate battery degradation as it gets older, or limiting charge speeds and maximum charge levels. Battery health assistance will join the ranks of battery-preserving features in a later update, Google says.</p>

<p>"You may notice small decreases in your battery’s runtime as your battery ages," the company writes. "Battery health assistance will also tune the phone’s charging speed based on adjusted capacity. You may notice a slight change in battery charging performance."</p><p>For now, the Pixel 9a is the only device confirmed to get this feature when it launches later this year. However, it's expected to come to more devices. These features aren't user-customizable.</p><p>"Battery health assistance is a software feature that will roll out to a selection of Pixel devices starting later this year, designed to extend their usability," Google told 9to5Google in a statement. The company also said Battery health assistance "will be voluntary for any customers using previously launched devices."</p><p>This feature isn't available now, and doesn't have a set release date. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is expected to bring along a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-might-finally-introduce-battery-health-feature-with-android-16"> few other battery health tools for Pixels</a> later this year.</p>

<p>Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental</a> less than a week ago, and it's already rolling out to free users on the web, plus the Gemini apps for Android and iOS. When the company revealed the early version of Gemini 2.5 Pro on March 25, it was exclusive to Gemini Advanced subscribers. That exclusivity period didn't last long, as Google extended its best experimental model to free users by Saturday, March 29.</p><p>"Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off," the company wrote in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1906131622736679332" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> on the Gemini app account.

Try it at no… https://t.co/eqCJwwVhXJ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1906131622736679332">March 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>There are still crucial advantages for Gemini Advanced subscribers. Google says that rate limits will apply to free Gemini users, whole Gemini Advanced users "have expanded access and a significantly larger context window." For now, Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental has a one-million-token context window that will double in the future. These features are available as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>, which costs $20 per month.</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro launched at the top many of the benchmarks and leaderboards for large language models (LLMs), including LMArena, where it is still the top-ranking chatbot as of today. Google originally explained that it developed Gemini 2.5 Pro by "combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training."</p>

<p>Presumably, Google wants to get Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental — its best AI model yet — in the hands of more users. While still an experimental model, Gemini 2.5 Pro has support for file uploads, extensions, and Canvas. It currently lacks a few features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deep-research-could-be-the-next-gemini-feature-to-hit-free-users-per-report">Deep Research</a> mode.</p><p>It's unclear whether the final version of Gemini 2.5 Pro will also be made available to free users in a limited fashion.</p>

<p><em><strong>Phil writes:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Would you explain what an international version phone is and what some of the benefits and main consequences may be if purchased? Or is it simply a pass?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks in advance,</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Phil</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Phil. This is a great question on two fronts, and I'm really glad you asked. It gives a chance for some useful information to be written, and it reminds people like me that not everyone is techy enough to know what all this stuff means.</p><p>For people who just want the answer, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ultra-mobile-review" target="_blank">international phone</a> is one designed to work in most countries around the globe. That used to be a bigger deal when phone carriers like Verizon and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-reaches-major-merger-milestone-officially-retires-sprint-brand" target="_blank">now-defunct Sprint</a> had non-compatible networks and charged extra for special phones that worked on them, but nowadays, it matters less.</p><p>Read on for more details.</p>

<h2 id="an-international-phone-can-mean-different-things-2">An "International phone" can mean different things</h2>
<p>If you were to ask me in a casual conversation, I'd give the answer above, but you might see other ways the words <em>international phone</em> are used, depending on where you look.</p><p>An international phone can be one designed for use in many countries around the globe. It can also mean an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone" target="_blank">unlocked phone</a> so you can put a different SIM card in it that is local for other countries. It can even mean a phone sold with a service plan that allows for sending and receiving calls across international borders. The last meaning is most popular for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-prepaid-cell-phones">prepaid phones</a>.</p>
<p>The phone's ability to make calls and use data depends on the modem inside it. Every carrier uses specific frequencies and tech to handle calls and data, and any equipment, like a phone, designed to be used with a carrier has to support those, or it's not going to work very well or at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xskHMTNsDeoUaW9jxDHrfS" name="oneplus-12-with-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-in-background" alt="The green OnePlus 12 in front of a grey Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xskHMTNsDeoUaW9jxDHrfS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most phones sold today can handle enough different radio bands to cover plenty of those frequencies and will work on many networks around the world. It didn't used to be that way, and even today, not all phones will work in all places.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/talk-mobile/whenever-wherever-why-you-cant-use-any-phone-on-any-carrier-talk-mobile">mattered a lot</a> just a few years ago. If you bought a phone from a carrier in the U.S. it <em>probably</em> wasn't going to work in Germany or Nigeria, for example. That's because the tech inside the phone's chip wasn't as advanced and couldn't handle that many different bands or because a carrier wanted to ensure you were locked in with a phone that only worked with them. Samsung's Galaxy models were notorious for this, with capable hardware deactivated at the behest of a phone carrier.</p><p>It's less of a thing today, thankfully. Chances are, any unlocked phone (one not tied to a specific carrier) is going to work in most places. Some countries like the U.S. and China still use specialized network tech, but unlocked phones can still use a portion of the network.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks-2">Drawbacks</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi" name="visible-sim-card-passport-hero.jpeg" alt="Visible SIM card sitting on top of US passport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is one big drawback you need to consider. It has nothing to do with how the phone operates, though.</p><p>Depending on where you buy it, an unlocked international version of a phone won't come with any sort of warranty. Someone once asked me about this, and my response was, "Can you fix it yourself if it breaks?" If the answer is no, I'd suggest not buying it. Phones are mass-produced by the millions, and there <em>will</em> be lemons. If you end up with one and don't have any sort of warranty, you're stuck.</p><p>Other than that, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s20-snapdragon-865-vs-exynos-990">mostly the same</a> phone as the model made specifically for your region. Most people want one because the phone is usually SIM unlocked and can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-is-android-bootloader">bootloader unlocked</a> so that custom firmware can be loaded onto it.</p>
<p>In essence, an unlocked phone is a device capable of being used in different countries and isn't hard to find if you want one.</p><p>You probably don't need one because your phone will work. All you need to do is ask your phone carrier to be sure. If you do buy one, remember you probably don't have any sort of warranty to fall back on if things go sour.</p>

<ul><li>The Garmin Vivoactive 6, like the last model, has a 1.2-inch AMOLED display, 11-day battery life, all-systems GNSS, and music storage.</li><li>It adds two new satellite systems, a gyroscope, new running coaching tools, doubled storage, and a new smart alarm.</li><li>It keeps the same Elevate v4 sensor as most last-gen Garmin watches, without ECG or skin temp support.</li><li>It ships in Slate, Lunar Gold, Metallic Jasper Green, and Metallic Pink Dawn for $299 and is available now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Garmin Vivoactive 6 has arrived as the latest "mainstream" watch for frugal athletes who can't afford the Venu 3. And while it does have software upgrades, the hardware is <em>quite</em> similar to the Vivoactive 5.</p><p>Both have an identical 42.2mm case size, 36g weight with strap, 1.2-inch AMOLED touch display with 325 PPI, 11-day battery life, and 17 hours of all-systems GNSS tracking.</p><p>The Vivoactive 6 does measure 0.2mm thinner, which we appreciate, and it has a new main button that's elevated and more compact than the last generation, hopefully making it easier to press.</p><p>Unfortunately, this watch has the same Elevate v4 sensors, with accurate heart rate, HRV, stress, blood oxygen, and sleep data, but no ECG or skin temperature readings like the 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>. Given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Instinct 3</a> also stuck to last-gen sensors, the cheaper Vivoactive 6 wasn't likely to upgrade, either. But it's still disappointing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="W3NeCWhgzJFj5NMR63fLfJ" name="garmin-vivoactive-6-body-battery-press-photo" alt="A press photo of three Garmin Vivoactive 6 watches sitting side by side on tiny stairs.

<p>You get the same aluminum bezel as the last generation, giving the Vivoactive 6 a distinct look compared to the steel or polymer bezels of most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>. It ships in Slate, Lunar Gold, Metallic Jasper Green, and Metallic Pink Dawn, and costs $299 like its predecessor.</p><p>In terms of what <em>is</em> new, the Vivoactive 6 gets doubled music storage to 8GB, support for two new satellite systems — BeiDou and QZSS — and a gyroscope for better wrist-tracking accuracy.</p><p>The last upgrade pairs well with the new Garmin Strength Coach and workout animations, letting you follow a months-long training plan with auto-generated workouts and see form guidance for reps on the Vivoactive 6. Of course, you'll need the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect+ subscription</a> that's generating controversy for the best indoor workouts.</p><p>Interestingly, Garmin improved running software tools on the Vivoactive 6, adding support for Track and Trail Running modes, post-run training effect, PacePro, wrist-based running dynamics, running power, and race predictions.</p><p>We only wish they'd added an altimeter for proper elevation tracking for runs, something the Vivoactive 4 had but the Vivoactive 5 cut. You'll need a Garmin Forerunner for that and other insights like training load.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en" name="Garmin-Venu-3-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG summary page on the Garmin Venu 3 saying the author's sinus rhythm is normal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Why won't Garmin give more watches its new Elevate sensor? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Along with strength training, Garmin says the Vivoactive 6 will have daily suggested workouts for walking, giving an example of "speed intervals" where you pick up the pace in short bursts. Garmin's suggested workouts have typically been for running and cycling; we love this addition for more casual athletes, helping people hit their daily step goals.</p><p>Garmin also added a "smart alarm" to the Vivoactive 6, a first for the Garmin brand. Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-dont-more-smartwatches-use-this-smart-rings-seemingly-obvious-trick">Fitbit's smart alarm</a>, it "looks for lighter sleep stages during a pre-selected window of time to gently wake users with a light vibration," so your REM sleep isn't disrupted, but you still wake up on time.</p><p>Otherwise, you're getting a long list of popular, mainstream-focused Garmin perks: enhanced Body Battery tracking, the Sleep Coach, wheelchair mode, images in notifications (Android only), stress tracking with meditation and breathing guidance, and Garmin Pay.</p><p>Overall, this feels like a fairly iterative update for the Vivoactive 6. But we already liked recommending the Vivoactive 5 as the entry-level Garmin watch for anyone new to the platform. The Vivoactive 6 retains that mainstream appeal, and we at least appreciate that it's trying new things with the smart alarm, strength coaching, and walk suggestions.</p><p>The Garmin Vivoactive 6 is now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1555457/pn/010-02985-03">Garmin's site</a>, where you can order it starting April 4.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It’s not a new concept, but it bears repeating when a pair of wireless earbuds try to make it work: can adaptive and personalized listening change how you listen to music? Creative is taking a crack at it with the Aurvana Ace Mimi.</p><p>The earbuds are successors to the previous Aurvana Ace 2, so they share a lot of the same features and functions, but in partnering with Mimi, the focus lies more squarely on custom sound profiles. That makes things interesting in getting really personal, though you have to make compromises to fully accept what these buds are.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-things-familiar-2">Keeping things familiar</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WQCUFLAASKsYK5uBwCY2HK" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-wearing" alt="Profile view of Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi earbuds in left ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQCUFLAASKsYK5uBwCY2HK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Creative sticks with a familiar look by making the Ace Mimi essentially carbon copies of the previous Aurvana Ace 2. The color is different, though, with a midnight shade that isn’t as flashy as the Ace 2. Otherwise, they maintain a lot of continuity, including the super lightweight build and matte finish, and similar size case.</p><p>Creative wisely includes both extra-small and extra-large ear tips (something the Aurvana Ace 2 don’t have) with the Ace Mimi, significantly improving the odds you’ll find a fit that works for you. This is especially important for the sheer comfort and stability necessary to enjoy what these buds do best.</p><p>Because they are so lightweight and unobtrusive, I sometimes didn’t realize I even had them on. Their IPX5 rating is okay for warding off sweat, but be mindful of wiping them clean each time to avoid salt slipping through crevices and hitting internal components.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-fit-and-right-sound-2">The right fit and right sound</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1015px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.60%;"><img id="V8wcUwv7mej6E2HpwMtZg5" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-screenshots-1" alt="Screenshots showing sound personalization test in Creative app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V8wcUwv7mej6E2HpwMtZg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1015" height="1082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the outset, the Creative app offers plenty of options to customize them to your liking. The key one lies with the Mimi-powered Sound Personalization that takes you through an exercise where you hold down an onscreen button until you stop hearing a beep.</p><p>You go through this with each ear and ultimately come up with a custom-tuned sound profile based on your hearing ability. The results then let you tailor it further by choosing either the recommended profile or opting for a softer or richer sound. There’s also an option to kind of mix it up by, say, choosing “richer” yet reducing the tuning’s intensity.</p><p>If you’re unsure about the efficacy, simply tap the “Hear the difference” button to compare it with no tuning and hear it for yourself. For me, the difference was audible in just about every respect. Not only does audio come through with more verve, it also sounds more detailed at all volumes, which is good for your ear health when you keep it a moderate level.</p><p>My one gripe about it is you have to sign up for a Creative account to get the feature. It’s free, but you’re sharing data because of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1015px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.60%;"><img id="a7iSeZQyHmFBnQDQ2FYjxm" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-screenshots-2" alt="Screenshots showing sound personalization and EQ in Creative app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a7iSeZQyHmFBnQDQ2FYjxm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1015" height="1082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite that, the custom choices don’t end there. The Equalizer section is one of the deepest you’ll ever find on any pair of earbuds. While the five-band EQ is perhaps less granular, there are 40+ presets to pick from, including several based on popular video game franchises. Create your own and save it to add to the list. The beauty of this is you can mix and match your personalized tuning with an EQ preset you like, vastly opening up the kind of sonic variety you get out of these buds.</p><p>There’s a good reason for the video game nod since the Low Latency Mode reduces lag to better sync audio and video, an important factor when gaming or watching video.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth codec</a> support is also superb, with support for SBC, AAC, LDAC, and LC3. Going with LDAC is interesting given the Aurvana Ace 2 support aptX Lossless, but that still gives you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone" target="_blank">hi-res playback</a> from devices and services supporting it anyway. With Bluetooth LE on board here as well, there’s support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024" target="_blank">Auracast</a>, a feature most Android phones already natively include (and more are getting, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Pixel 9</a> series).</p><p>As for controls, you have the ability to change those as you see fit. By default, a double tap on the left cycles between Ambient Control and ANC (active noise cancelation) while doing it on the right plays/pauses. Triple-tap the left to wake the phone’s voice assistant or the right to skip to the next track. Long tap left to lower volume, right to raise it.</p><p>Notably missing, however, are wear sensors to automatically pause playback when taking either earbud off — a glaring omission for this price range.</p>
<h2 id="hearing-a-little-too-much-2">Hearing a little too much</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ur6bKhah45a7Zxafx49ZQY" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-close-up" alt="Close-up view of Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi earbud in left ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ur6bKhah45a7Zxafx49ZQY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of where you choose to wear the Ace Mimi, there’s a balancing act at work here. ANC performance is largely mediocre, with a consistent inability to drown out most noises you don’t want while wearing them. You can expect them to dampen, so it’s not like these earbuds are totally inept, it’s just that you get what you can out of a $130 pair.</p><p>That’s why finding the right ear tips is so critical for better passive isolation to help the cause. The Ace Mimi work best in quieter environments where background noise isn’t very loud, even when you push the ANC’s potency to the max on the app.</p><p>Ambient works similarly in letting you adjust how much of the background you want to hear around you. Quickly switching to this mode to hear an announcement or engage in a quick verbal interaction feels pretty seamless, though again, you’ll get clearer results from more expensive earbuds.</p>
<h2 id="superb-sound-that-can-surprise-2">Superb sound that can surprise</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wHL7yZyGpDh3eVzYihXY9S" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-in-case" alt="Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi earbuds sitting in charging case with lid open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wHL7yZyGpDh3eVzYihXY9S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Creative cites the xMEMS drivers inside as the main, well, driver of the strong sound signature in the Ace Mimi, and I’m inclined to believe the claim. The Aurvana Ace 2 have the same drivers, which are capable of pumping out a healthy dose of bass to go with balanced mids and highs.</p><p>At this price, there’s going to be an unsurprising emphasis on bass response, but it’s nicely complemented by the surprising effectiveness of the rest of the spectrum. Warm and punchy highs, ever-present mids, and thick bass make these a pair worth looking at if you’re into music genres that skew toward the latter.</p><p>Again, you discover its extent when going through the personalized sound process. If you suffer from hearing loss or are sensitive to certain frequencies, the test can amplify or mitigate those details in impressive ways. Earbuds at this price range often give you an EQ to work with but not necessarily a hearing test that goes this far in producing a lasting result.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xm54UULvQRXbojKjsDrmHH" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-hand" alt="Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi earbuds in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xm54UULvQRXbojKjsDrmHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It extends to watching content as well. The depth of an explosion or the crispness of dialogue, for instance, are welcome strides. Spatial audio only works if you have the ability to listen to something  via Creative’s SXFI app, though that only applies to media files you have saved on the device, not when streaming.</p><p>Phone calls prove excellent in most conditions. The onboard mics won’t completely muffle louder sounds around you, but they can muffle them enough to keep a conversation going. In quiet confines, they’re as solid as it gets at this price.</p>
<h2 id="not-so-long-battery-life-2">Not so long battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2xStE7i7DMmoqCic5j5XTS" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-case" alt="Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi charging case sitting up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2xStE7i7DMmoqCic5j5XTS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Creative rates battery life at up to seven hours per charge with ANC off. Leave it on, and you’re looking at five hours or less, depending on how high the volume is. Even with three additional charges in the case, these numbers aren’t all that impressive. The case supports wireless charging, so it’s easy to appreciate the convenience. I didn’t find a fast charging feature here but it doesn’t take too long to fully recharge both the case and earbuds.</p>
<h2 id="getting-more-for-less-2">Getting more for less</h2>
<p>While it’s not hard to find similar features and designs from others in the same price range, you’d be hard-pressed to find the level of sound customization available with the Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi. Indeed, on that alone, they’re competitive relative to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">best wireless earbuds</a>.</p><p>They sound better than some earbuds costing significantly more, and despite their limited ANC and battery prowess, they feel like a real bang-for-your-buck option. Good sound is worth paying a value price, especially when these sound so much better than the AirPods.</p>

<ul><li>The OnePlus Open is picking up a new update with the March 2025 security patch via OxygenOS 15.</li><li>The changelog details a security improvement for user data, as well as a couple of home screen customization updates.</li><li>The OnePlus Open 2 is still of interest, especially after a teaser earlier this year, which suggests it will be pencil-thin like the OPPO Find N5.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is currently starting to roll out its latest OxygenOS update for its book-style foldable.</p><p>The update notice was posted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1825708001307131911">Community forums</a>, stating its rollout bears vCPH2551_15.0.0.700(EX01) for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> users in India. Those with the device are in for quite a few improvements, beginning with the phone's privacy and security. According to OnePlus, the latest OxygenOS 15 update "Improves the process for resetting your privacy password." The patch notes add that users will be prompted to link their "privacy password with their account."</p><p>It seems this is designed to help users regain access if they've forgotten their credentials. OnePlus states users can reset their password through their account.</p><p>Elsewhere, the March 2025 security patch is rolling alongside these changes. The Chinese OEM is also improving the music player controls of Spotify's Live Alerts. OnePlus adds it's bringing a slight home screen customization change for folders and widgets. For folders, users can resize them to be 1x2 or 2x1 on the home screen.</p><p>The update for widgets is said to facilitate more "visual consistency" as foldable users now receive a 2x2 size option for third-party widgets. It says users will find this new appearance choice in <strong>Settings > Home Screen & Lock Screen > Optimize Widget appearance</strong>.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Adds an option to rename an app group by touching and holding its shortcut on the Home screen</li><li>Improves the widget design for Zomato and Blinkit in Shelf to better communicate the app status</li><li>Improves Wi-Fi network switching and mobile data roaming for a more seamless experience</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF" name="oneplus-open-23.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As previously stated, the update has been announced for India; however, it's expected to hit other regions (like the U.S.) soon. It may appear for users later this week or next week. Regardless, you can continue to manually check your device for the patch if you wish.</p><p>The OnePlus Open's latest major update arrived around the holidays last year as the company rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-is-rolling-out-to-oneplus-open-in-the-u-s-next-week">Android 15 upgrade</a>. Under the guise of OxygenOS 15, the update brought several animation tweaks to the foldable, which made things feel more consistent and smooth. Additionally, OnePlus worked on improvements for users utilizing third-party applications. As AI is all the rage, the company brought a few tools, such as AI Retouch and AI Reflection Eraser. Both were aimed at reducing the amount of blur and/or unfocused imagery in user photos.</p><p>Like today's update, the Android 15 initially started in India before hitting global regions a week later.</p><p>While you may not want to hear it, we're still waiting on the OnePlus Open 2, despite its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-really-hope-the-oneplus-open-2-doesnt-make-the-same-mistake-as-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">sheer number of delays</a>. The device is expected to be a more global-oriented device based on OPPO's Find N5, which looks incredibly pencil-thin. There's still a lot of uncertainty about when the device will be released, so it's best to play things by ear for now.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When it rains, it pours, and we're right in the middle of a storm as there are new gaming handhelds being announced every week. One of the latest is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/abxylute/abxylute-one-pro">Abxylute One Pro</a>, which is a successor to the Abxylute Cloud Gaming Handheld from 2023.</p><p>Abxylute saw what Logitech was about to do with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/logitech-g-cloud-gaming-handheld-launch">G Cloud</a> and tried to capitalize on the idea of a "cloud-gaming-first" handheld. Unlike AYANEO or AYN, the One Pro doesn't have a flagship processor; instead, it relies on the MediaTek Genio 510.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kqOIbOK4W_c" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>This is paired with just 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage, which isn't all that much, but that's the point. However, there's one handheld out there that can do everything the One Pro promises, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld">Retroid Pocket 5</a> has a few key advantages over Abxylute's newest gaming handheld.</p><p>Powered by the Snapdragon 865, the Pocket 5 is already quite a bit more performant than the One Pro. This lets you enjoy many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">best Android games</a> while also being pretty fantastic when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">retro emulation</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xdc7ksvpoxfqoDvL63HKT8" name="retroid-pocket-5-halo-2-anbernic-rg35xxsp-gamesir-super-nova-controller" alt="Playing Halo 2 on the Retroid Pocket 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xdc7ksvpoxfqoDvL63HKT8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I was surprised to see Abxylute point out that the One Pro can emulate up to PS2, because while it's a massive improvement over its predecessor, it's also not unprecedented. Meanwhile, the Retroid Pocket 5 has a unique advantage in that you can either stick to Android, or you can install a custom Linux firmware (ROCKNIX or Batocera) that unlocks Xbox and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3 emulation</a>.</p><p>Okay, the latter was more exciting before RPCS3-Android began development, but there's no such solution with Xbox emulation. Sure, you can fire up Xbox Game Pass or any of the other cloud gaming services and stream Halo Infinite. But being able to play the original Halo and Halo 2 without worrying about internet speeds is pretty incredible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5328px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jkKuRNaZ99AJgj4RXQ57KU" name="abxylute-one-pro-press-lifestyle-2" alt="Abxylute One Pro PS2 emulation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jkKuRNaZ99AJgj4RXQ57KU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5328" height="2997" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Abxylute)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On top of that, another big benefit that the Retroid Pocket 5 has over the Abxylute One Pro is the AMOLED display. Abxylute opted for an LCD panel, which looks great in the videos I've seen, but it doesn't match up to an OLED screen. And the one that we have in the Pocket 5 looks simply incredible.</p><p>However, the One Pro has an advantage of its own, as it sports a 7-inch display compared to the 5.5-inch screen of the Pocket 5. This also makes for a larger footprint, which some will likely find to be more comfortable than what Retroid provides.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5328px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kpi96FzpCnL3P6WRpevDRU" name="abxylute-one-pro-press-lifestyle-1" alt="Abxylute One Pro game selection press lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpi96FzpCnL3P6WRpevDRU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5328" height="2997" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Abxylute)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, there is one more hurdle that I think Abxylute will need to figure out how to overcome, and that's price. Right now, the One Pro can be ordered via Kickstarter for $209. But that's just the Early Bird price, and the One Pro will jump up to $249 once it's officially released.</p><p>That's still less expensive than the G Cloud and its $299 price tag, but it's also more expensive than the Retroid Pocket 5. It's even more expensive than the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a>, which is essentially the Pocket 5 in a clamshell form factor, complete with the OLED display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2042px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bHqL3yYMLPcBP9Y4L6c2YV" name="retroid-pocket-flip-2-press-lifestyle" alt="Retroid Pocket Flip 2 in Ice Blue press lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bHqL3yYMLPcBP9Y4L6c2YV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2042" height="1149" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nevertheless, it's interesting to see Abxylute release a new cloud-first gaming handheld while Logitech hasn't decided to do the same with the G Cloud. If the One Pro's Kickstarter campaign is anything to go by, there's still plenty of interest in such a handheld, even with similar devices already available.</p><p>If you want to get the Abxylute One Pro, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/abxylute/abxylute-one-pro">Kickstarter campaign</a> is officially live. Early Bird pricing puts the handheld at $209, which saves you $40 off the expected retail price of $249.</p>

<ul><li>Three leaked renderings, reportedly of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, suggest Google might not veer much off its 9 series designs.</li><li>The foldable looks largely similar to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, with a similar rear camera housing, cover display, and internal designs.</li><li>Pixel 10 Pro Fold rumors have been scarce; however, the phone may see another August launch this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Starting the week is an alleged leak involving the potential design of Google's next foldable phone.</p><p>A trio of supposed renderings of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold were surfaced from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Android Headlines</a>, which purport an extremely familiar phone. Funnily enough, the rumored renders even showcase the next device in the same Porcelain color as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">its predecessor</a>, so perhaps that's to be expected once again. Regarding its hardware, the alleged imagery suggests the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will continue to feature a similar cover display (in design) to the 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>The publication didn't give specifics; however, it claims the next iteration is the "spitting image" of what we received last year.</p><p>There's a centered punch-hole selfie camera on the external display, too. Internally, the renderings show a screen with seemingly thick bezels and a right-corner oriented selfie camera — like 2024. Google may continue to feature rounded corners for its next foldable phone, which has become expected. Moreover, the rear camera array may continue to host three cameras. Consumers <em>may </em>see this as a 48MP primary lens, a 10.5MP ultrawide, and a 10.8MP telephoto.</p><p>The publication claims the device could be offered at a "lower price point" compared to last year. Additionally, there's speculation that Google could trim down the phone's thickness, though it's unclear by how much. Other rumors include the Tensor G5, 16GB of RAM with 256GB or 512GB internal storage.</p>

<p>As a reminder, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> features an 8-inch Super Actua Flex display and a 6.3-inch cover display. Considering how similar these renders suggest the next version will be, there's a chance consumers may see specs like this once more. Both the cover display camera and the internal one are 10MP on last year's model. Battery-wise, the 9 Pro Fold contains a 4,650mAh setup and 45W wired charging.</p><p>Information concerning the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has been scarce, but it's been expected ever since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">the 10 series' codenames</a> were leaked last fall. In that leak, it was stated the series would see the following names: Frankel, Blazer, Mustang, and Rango. These are for the base Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and the 10 Pro Fold, respectively. Elsewhere, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">reportedly finished designing</a> its first fully custom Tensot G5 chip — which is to be built by TSMC — earlier this year.</p><p>The chip is expected to bring improved performance over the G4, as well as better battery life for Google's next phones. What's more, it was rumored that the G5 would pack more AI (to no one's surprise) like "Speak to Tweak" and a feature similar to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a>.</p><p>It's still early to get too excited over what's rumored for the Pixel 10 Fold, as the device is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-10-has-a-model-number-according-to-gsma-database-entries">speculated to launch in August</a> once again.</p>

The Amazon Spring Big Sale brings with it a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2SBHQK"><strong>22% discount on the Amazon Echo Show 5,</strong></a> a small Alexa-friendly device for just $69.99 with this deal.</p><p>The Echo Show 5 is Amazon's smallest smart display, sporting a microphone that can be used for Alexa voice commands and to control your other smart home devices, from thermostats and smart doorbells to speakers and TVs. This generation of the Echo Show 5 was also launched with enhanced audio, sporting twice the bass, and it includes a 2MP camera suitable for basic video calling capabilities.</p><p>Though there are larger options, we think the Echo Show 5 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-echo-show#section-best-value">best value Amazon Echo Show device</a>, and getting an added discount makes it even more appealing.</p>

At $25 off for the Amazon Big Spring Sale, now might be good time to pick one up if you were considering it already. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2SBHQK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="70004701-a7f0-4c94-84bb-97e12b3a4990" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Echo Show 5:" data-dimension48="Amazon Echo Show 5:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you use Alexa to control smart home devices in your household; you're thinking about adding one or more Amazon smart displays and need them for cheap; you want a smart display with physical privacy covers for the mic and camera.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a smart display that includes a headphone jack; you need something with a more-powerful camera; you don't use Alexa or other Amazon ecosystem smart home devices.</p><p>As far as Amazon's many smart home devices go, the Echo Show 5 is an excellent value pick overall for those within the Alexa ecosystem.</p><p>The main difference between the Echo Show 5 and the 8 and 15 models is, unsurprisingly, it's small size. The 5 version comes with a 5.5-inch display, and a significantly more affordable price tag than its larger counterparts.</p><p>Those looking to start or expand their forays into smart homes can use the Echo Show 5 to control a wide range of Alexa-compatible smart devices, including speakers, lights, doorbells, thermostats, security cameras, and more. This iteration of the Echo Show 5 also includes a physical cover and off switch for the microphones and camera, adding an extra layer of security for the privacy-conscious consumer.</p>

Most earbuds look nearly identical to one another, but nothing looks like the CMF Buds Pro 2 which are back down <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Pro-Cancelling-Technology/dp/B0D82ZBMBT/"><strong>to just $50</strong></a> during the remaining hours of Amazon's Big Spring Sale!</p><p>Aside from sporting noise cancelling and a comfortable, light fit, CMF Buds Pro 2 feature the best charging case on any set of earbuds to date. That's because it doesn't just charge your earbuds, it also <em>controls</em> them with the handy click wheel on the case that doubles as a button.</p><p>You can use this to quickly adjust the volume from your pocket — instead of using those finicky touch controls most earbuds have — click it to play or pause, switch songs, open an app, call up your favorite AI assistant, and more thanks to its highly customizable nature. And, of course, all this cool functionality comes at a fraction of the price of most other earbuds.</p>

<p>These are true wireless earbuds, which means there's no cable between them and no cable to plug into your phone. Each earbud is packed with a 60mAh battery, so you get about 10 hours of listening before needing to dock them back into the case. And, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">unlike some earbuds</a>, docking them in the case is super easy.</p><p>Of course, a $50 pair of earbuds aren't going to produce the same level of sound that a $300 pair will, but that didn't stop Harish from being impressed. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-convinced-nothings-cmf-buds-pro-2-are-the-only-budget-earbuds-worth-buying">He said</a>, "these are the best-sounding budget earbuds I've ever used, and <strong>the sound quality is equivalent to products that cost thrice as much.</strong>" Considering how much of an audiophile Harish is, I took his word for it and picked up a pair for myself. I couldn't be happier!</p><p>I've been using these as my daily pair of headphones since last Fall and can't get enough of how cool this case is. There's simply nothing like being able to adjust your volume, skip songs, call up Gemini, or do nearly anything else you want with the customizable wheel button on the case.</p><p>If you're a frequent flyer, you might want to spend a little more money on a pair of earbuds with stronger ANC than these but, for most scenarios, the sound quality and ANC strength make these must-haves. Especially for $50!</p>

<hr>
<p>Starting today (Mar. 31), Oura will roll out its new AI-powered feature to users globally. The company is calling this feature the "Oura Advisor," a digital assistant designed to help users better understand their health goals. This feature was in the testing phase for most of last year when the company announced that users would be able to take it for a spin via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-app-advisor-labs-test-launch"> Oura Labs</a>.</p><p>Now, Oura tells Android Central that all Android and iOS users will see the Oura Advisor pop-up on their apps. This will empower users to stay on track with their health goals, giving them "personalized insights, recommendations, and encouragement."</p><p>Oura added that this advisor is less of a feature and more of a coach to the smart ring wearer. It wants people to think of the Oura Advisor as their trainer that they can carry in their pockets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3590px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wQLXUwnKYzCT52CMfPCgSj" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-08.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 on an index finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wQLXUwnKYzCT52CMfPCgSj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3590" height="2019" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once this digital coach is summoned, it will tell you what your health stats look like and give you personalized recommendations on what kind of activities you should focus on. It has the power to look through various health parameters to give users "tailored" lifestyle changes so that they can improve their sleep, stay calmer in stressful situations, and optimize their overall physical and mental health.</p><p>What's more, is that the Oura Advisor will give you these recommendations in a "coherent guidance storyline" that connects different pieces of advice into a story that's easy to follow along.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZPvFWFdsHSySsgtQVVvsX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-04" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus revealing scratches on the back with the Oura Ring 4 top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZPvFWFdsHSySsgtQVVvsX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, since the Oura Advisor is a conversational chatbot, its tone is also dynamic — this means your digital coach could take a supportive, mentoring, or even goal-oriented tone. "It adjusts based on the user's chosen tonality, affecting the conversation's perspective while maintaining empathy and core values," Oura added.</p><p>This AI chatbot can "think" independently about you even when you're inactive, so it can give you more relevant advice when you engage with it. While it's doing its thinking, the Oura Advisor will look through different user trends and data, as it has access to something called “Memories.”</p><p>Oura explains that these Memories allow it "to retain and reference context from past conversations and make long-term connections about user behaviors and patterns."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U7fBa7VRNN4TNQtx75GsPK" name="Oura-Circles.jpg" alt="Oura Circles feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7fBa7VRNN4TNQtx75GsPK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to data collected during the test run of the Oura Advisor, the company reports that over 60% of users interacted with the digital coach multiple times a week, with 20% using it daily and 56% reporting that the Oura Advisor helped turn insights into actions with health benefits.</p><p>Essentially, with the integration of AI, the Oura Advisor aims to help users better understand their Oura Ring's data and trends, which will "empower them to take control of their health and well-being," the ring maker added.</p><p>Elsewhere, Oura is partnering with more retailers to make the latest Oura Ring accessible to more people. Last week, the company announced that the smart ring will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-retail-expansion-to-costco-announced" target="_blank">debut</a> on Costco's website and will be available to Costco Members in sizes four through 15 and in gold, silver, and black.</p>

The device packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and 12GB of RAM.</p>

<p>Prior to this, internal One UI 8 test builds for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> surfaced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1897973087674478795" target="_blank">Samsung’s servers</a>. This new leak further confirms that Samsung is actively working on its next software release.</p><p>Samsung’s first Android 16 test builds popping up in March is a big shift. Last year, we didn’t see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> test builds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-early-testing-spotted">until May</a>.</p>

<h2 id="way-ahead-of-schedule-2">Way ahead of schedule?</h2>
<p>The earlier arrival of these builds suggests One UI 8.0 is moving faster than One UI 7.0. But that’s not too surprising. Last year's 7.0 update was basically a complete makeover under the hood, so of course it needed extra time in the shop.</p><p>With all that architectural work now out of the way, Samsung is apparently able to shift gears and speed up development this time around. Unlike One UI 7, One UI 8 builds on an existing framework, allowing Samsung to focus more on optimizations and new features instead of major structural changes.</p>
<h2 id="but-hold-the-comparisons-2">But hold the comparisons</h2>
<p>However, comparing these two development cycles isn’t apples to apples. Google usually drops new Android versions alongside its fall Pixel launch, but rumors suggest Android 16 might arrive earlier this year, possibly in June instead of the usual August or September.</p><p>This isn't Google cutting the line, though. The tech giant is just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-may-only-support-seamless-updates">shifting to a new development approach</a> that speeds up major Android updates.</p><p>With Android 16 possibly launching earlier, it makes sense that Samsung is already testing One UI 8. Since the update is expected to be more incremental, its rollout could closely follow Google’s timeline.</p>

It comes with a built-in USB-C charging cable and a 20W re-charging port, and it's currently available in four different colors.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a small, affordable power bank that can keep devices charged for a while; you don't want to spend more than $15 on a portable charger; you need a power bank with 30W fast-charging.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you'd rather upgrade to a larger battery and wouldn't mind paying more.</p><p>The Anker Zolo Power Bank is a pretty basic portable device charger, but at under $13, it's not a bad option even as a backup or second power bank. Anker says this device can charge most phones to roughly 50 percent in under half an hour using its 30W charging speeds. In addition to the built-in USB-C cable, it also includes a 20W recharging port for the power bank itself.</p><p>The Zolo is available in Black, Blue, Pink, or White, and it measures just about 4.32 inches by 2.58 inches for a small, transport-friendly design.</p><p>If you're looking for an even larger portable power bank, the Zolo's 20,000mAh configuration is currently about 32% off, ringing in at just under $25. Or you can upgrade even further to around 50,000mAh, which many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best power banks</a> offer. Still, you'll definitely pay more at the premium level, and 10,000 or 20,000mAh is usually enough for most phones and other small devices.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a phone with a vibrant AMOLED display; battery life is a major selling-point for you when it comes to phones; you want a phone that comes with the latest AI features, without going with the latest-gen phone.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want an even more affordable smartphone than this; you like smaller phones; you'd rather upgrade to the S25, S25 Plus, or S25 Ultra.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-launch">Samsung launched the S24 FE</a> last September, featuring a vibrant 6.7-inch SuperAMOLED display, as well as a 4,700mAh battery, both of which were upgrades from the S23 FE. At the time, we said this phone was a little pricey for the offering, but over $100 off might be just the right price point for interested parties. However, the screen features a quick 120Hz refresh rate, while Samsung says battery life can last up to 28 hours of "watching" time, or 81 hours of listening time.</p><p>The "Fan Edition" S24 also boasts 8GB of RAM, a 50MP primary rear camera lens,  AI features such as Generative Edit, Slow-mo, Portrait Studio, Circle to Search, and more. Additionally, those with other Samsung devices will find user-friendly compatibility, with added Galaxy features such as extended displays, quick file transfers, special lossless listening codecs, and more.</p>

<p>Garmin Connect Plus is a surprisingly useful skeleton of a strong fitness subscription. The AI is mostly a retread of the Garmin analytics you know and love, with plenty of room to improve. But it's just window dressing next to the Performance Dashboard, coaching videos, and other features designed to give Garmin fans FOMO.</p><p>But the better Connect Plus gets and the more features it receives, the more it will piss off loyal Garmin customers already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/furious-garmin-users-revolt-over-new-subscription-service-we-need-to-take-a-firm-stand" target="_blank">revolting over the service</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-garmin-connect-plus-subscription-adds-active-intelligence-beta-enhanced-smarts">Garmin Connect Plus</a> is arguably the most significant change Garmin has made to its business model in years. It joins the AI health and fitness trend alongside Fitbit, Samsung Health, and Strava (among others). In doing so, Garmin undermined its decade-long business model of free software paired with expensive hardware.</p><p>Rather than focus on whether or not Garmin <em>should</em> have made Connect Plus — or at least bundled it with recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> purchases or all recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> to ease the transition — I'll discuss how Connect Plus works in practice, what needs improvements, and where things should go from here.</p>

<h2 id="active-intelligence-has-a-ton-of-room-to-grow-2">Active Intelligence has a ton of room to grow</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iBjFotHpzhbBfGorXaBRgd" name="garmin-connect-plus-active-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Four screenshots of the Garmin Connect app Home tab showing the new Connect Plus Active Intelligence summary, focusing on the user's intensity minutes, step count, Training Status, and average stress levels." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iBjFotHpzhbBfGorXaBRgd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin Active Intelligence and Strava Athlete Intelligence invite obvious comparisons. Aside from the similar names, both analyze personalized fitness data and contextualize recent activities against past trends. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Strava's AI recently left beta</a>, while Garmin's may be in beta for some time. So let's compare them!</p><p>Garmin's AI is basically a time-sensitive chatbot that reacts to your most recent or relevant fitness data and trends. I've seen it discuss my intensity minute trends, current training status, most recent activity, elevated stress averages, and daily step trends over the past couple of days.</p><p>It ranges from insightful to nagging and sometimes repeats itself when it runs out of things to say.</p><p>Strava's AI focuses more closely on individual workouts. Each activity will compare your heart rate, HR zone breakdown, pace, elevation gain, and Relative Effort against your 30-day average. That's something I'd love to see Garmin emulate, showing a static AI breakdown in each run's "Overview" rather than a fleeting note in the Home page.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8" name="strava-athlete-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Screenshots showing Strava's Athlete Intelligence: Left - an LLM summary of the athlete's half-marathon run and comparative effort to past runs; center: an LLM summary of how their pace compares to past runs above pace stats; right: an LLM summary of the runner's most common HR zone and the intensity of the workout above a HR chart." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I will say that Garmin's AI seems a bit more polished than Strava's AI was in early beta; I still remember the latter telling me that my 140 bpm-average run was an anaerobic effort. On the other hand, Active Intelligence repeats info from the In Focus charts, watch face data fields, or Glance widgets on your watch. Basically, it's about reinforcing what Garmin considers important, not anything "original."</p><p>Maybe the AI will get more focused and specialized based on what tidbits you label as "Interesting" or "Not Interesting" in the app. At least, I hope it will!</p><p>I rarely sleep wearing my Garmin watch; people who closely follow their HRV Status or Body Battery data may benefit more from these text-based summaries. For the people who only wear Garmin watches for activities and Garmin Coach, I hope they can make Active Intelligence more focused on that side of things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dayKKxVDbTqXNNUmuBwPeL" name="garmin-active-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Samsung Garmin Connect Plus screenshots showing the Active Intelligence AI summarizing users' data to recommend future activities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dayKKxVDbTqXNNUmuBwPeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, the Garmin Coach tab could show an AI summary of how you've improved since Week 1, or how well you're keeping up with your scheduled workouts. Or the Challenges view could note if you're behind on certain goals and what kind of workout you should do next to keep track.</p><p>I'd like to see Active Intelligence focus more on longer-term trends. The Performance Dashboard (see the next section) has a ton of useful insights and trends across years of data; maybe the AI can note which charts and fields you're tracking and update you on changing trends when you don't have time to log into the desktop app.</p><p>As it is, Active Intelligence is a nice, limited perk. Garmin watches were already special because people could trust the Firstbeat Analytics algorithm analyzing their data behind the scenes. This AI just puts that information into text form. So, let's talk more about the other Connect Plus features.</p>
<h2 id="performance-dashboard-is-the-best-part-of-connect-plus-2">Performance Dashboard is the best part of Connect Plus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ozzinSD9xhwP2EnnBao3TN" name="Garmin-Performance-Dashboard-charts" alt="Nine Garmin Performance Dashboard charts showing an athlete's performance over time in terms of Distance, elevation, training status, heart rate zones, hill score, and other training details." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozzinSD9xhwP2EnnBao3TN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I haven't spent much time in the Garmin Connect desktop app, except to export GPX files for my HR and GPS tests; the mobile version is more accessible and doesn't trigger a 2FA code, no matter how often I check "Remember Me." However, the Performance Dashboard makes the desktop Connect app so much more compelling.</p><p>This new Connect Plus feature has <strong>123</strong> charts, and you can set up a max of 18 to be visible at any given time. There are far too many categories to list here, but you can track the basics like distance, number of activities, or training load, or more specialized stats like your running form, endurance/hill scores, cycling power, swim strokes, Body Battery, or race predictor over time.</p><p>For each of your 18 charts, you can set a custom date range like "this month" or "last 26 weeks," as well as add overlay stats so you can see (for example) how your total distance over time matches with your chronic load or average daily stress.</p>

<p>Basically, it's a treasure trove of data that you can fine-tune into a much better and personalized summary of your recent progress than Garmin can fit into its mobile "In Focus" section.</p><p>My immediate favorite? The "Comparison" charts that show how my 2025 number of activities, mileage, or elevation gain compares to my stats in 2024. It helps me see (without having to write down stats myself) that I've fallen slightly behind and need to pick up the pace in April.</p><p>It's incredibly comprehensive and customizable from my perspective as a semi-serious runner. So the only real complaint I can make about Performance Dashboard is, well, that Garmin held this back for its subscription service.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CKUpWQ3JnE9zxn6JgRF4wf" name="Garmin-run-coach-training-video" alt="A video showing the words "Garmin Run Coach" on a Google Pixel 9 held in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CKUpWQ3JnE9zxn6JgRF4wf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you sign up for Garmin Run or Cycling Coach, you get a months-long training program with customized workouts; no subscription is needed. What's new is "additional exclusive expert guidance from Garmin coaches — including educational content and videos — for peak performance."</p><p>I haven't seen too much of this yet because you only get one video per day; I've seen a generic "Welcome to your plan" onboarding video and another describing why "base" workouts matter.</p><p>But Garmin has always talked about its Coaching algorithm being backed by real-life coaches, and I'd <em>love</em> to see daily videos tied to your current workout or general advice.</p><p>For instance, if you have an anaerobic sprint workout planned, a coach could explain why it's necessary for runners who prefer longer, slower runs; show footage of possible warm-up stretches before your sprints; or talk about different types of track workouts if you're bored with Garmin's usual options.</p><p>Specific to the new Garmin strength cross-training workouts, we could see videos related to proper squat form or how certain muscle groups translate into better running or cycling form. I doubt they'd have the production value of Apple Fitness+ workout videos, but it's a start!</p><p>I can't say whether these educational videos will live up to my hopes, but this feels like a natural way for Garmin to augment its free Coach with content that feels reasonable to pay for rather than a feature that <em>should</em> be free.</p>
<h2 id="new-badges-fun-novelty-or-pay-to-win-mistake-2">New badges: Fun novelty or pay-to-win mistake?</h2>

<p>I don't pay much attention to Garmin badges except as a motivator to try and hit certain monthly or quarterly mileage and steps goals. Others take these badges as a point of pride, competing with friends on points leaderboards.</p><p>Now, Connect Plus is adding a bunch of new, gold-tinted badges that provide more variety in what you can track. Next month, you can aim to burn 8,000 calories, climb 500/1,000 meters while running or hiking, record 3 hours in HR zone 3, hit a high Body Battery score for 7+ days, or average a fast pace or higher HR across a few hours of walking.</p><p>Garmin badges have always felt too rigid and repetitive to me, so I see this as a fun novelty, especially if Garmin offers unique challenges every month. But I can absolutely understand how the more serious Garmin power users might see this as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/03/28/garmin-badge-pay/">pay-to-win change that upends the entire system</a> because people who <em>don't</em> pay for Connect Plus can't keep up with those who do.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2923px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WLp83g35Kn66APtTaXDoZQ" name="Garmin-Connect-Plus-beta-hero-2" alt="A photo of the Garmin Connect app Home tab showing the new Connect+ Active Intelligence summary, which describes the quality and training effect of a recent three-mile track workout.

<p>Garmin always felt like the exception to these subscription-driven companies, selling pricey hardware that would pay itself off by lasting for years with no post-purchase fees.</p><p>Connect Plus changes that, and while long-time fans might not care about the AI, they'll certainly resent not getting the Performance Dashboard and the other perks.</p><p>Some of the Connect Plus features feel like niche, power-user upgrades. It would've been nice if the new LiveTrack upgrades — a dedicated URL, auto-text alerts, and the option to embed your progress chart on a website — had been free updates, but I doubt the majority of Garmin customers use LiveTrack (correct me if I'm wrong!).</p><p>The new Live Activity tool feels much more like a "base" feature. You can see a few real-time stats in the mobile app during an activity, as well as trigger the next step in an indoor workout while checking the proper form for about 500 different exercise types. This has a lot of widespread appeal, both for regular gym-goers and for beginners, and it's a shame to see it behind the paywall.</p><p>Overall, I think Connect Plus would've always annoyed people on principle, but less so if Garmin had had the foresight to offer a longer trial period to recent watch buyers. Google and Apple give a six-month trial with a new device, and Samsung has made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> free for a couple of years. If Garmin had done the same, it would've lessened the sting a bit.</p><p>As it is, we're going to have to watch closely to see what Garmin does with Connect+ moving forward. In most cases, people wait eagerly for new features; in this case, any new Connect+ features through the rest of 2025 will only worsen the outrage.</p>

Especially if it's just a one-off or one with a different color compared to what was originally released.</p><p>That being said, an exception should be made for controllers and other peripherals that hit that nostalgia bone in the right way. Such is the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://backbone.com/products/backbone-one-usb-c-xbox-edition/">Backbone One: Xbox Edition</a>, which came as a surprise announcement on a random Thursday in March.</p><p>The Backbone One was originally launched all the way back in 2020. Then, an updated iteration landed in 2023, implementing a few improvements while also arriving after Apple made the switch from Lightning to USB-C and introducing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/backbone-playstation-edition-android-controller-launch">PlayStation Edition</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3404px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="p4rnFTg8Yi7eSR9ejDVBnQ" name="backbone-one-xbox-edition-this-is-an-xbox-render" alt="Backbone One: Xbox Edition "This is an Xbox" promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p4rnFTg8Yi7eSR9ejDVBnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3404" height="1915" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Backbone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, and there's now an Xbox Edition, but it doesn't just slap lipstick on and call itself a by different name. Backbone worked with Microsoft to bring us a controller with the same Translucent Green color scheme as the original Halo Special Edition Xbox. And it looks simply incredible.</p><p>While the PlayStation Edition ditches the ABXY buttons to match up with the shapes on the DualSense controller, you won't find a dedicated PlayStation button. On this latest iteration, the "Capture" button has been (somewhat) surprisingly replaced by an Xbox logo. I say somewhat because I can only assume that this was probably one of Microsoft's requirements before signing off on such a collaboration.</p><p>It would've been awesome to have the original Xbox logo, but let's be honest; it's not like there's really much real estate to work with here. Plus, who cares?!? I seriously haven't been this excited about a controller since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo</a> started releasing modern versions of its classic controllers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="upnuwJyGKztjivhnTmaP4Q" name="8bitdo-retro-87-keyboard-mouse-hero-render" alt="8Bitdo Retro 87 keyboard and mouse lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/upnuwJyGKztjivhnTmaP4Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 8Bitdo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While my excitement levels are off the charts, Backbone isn't the only company working with Microsoft on similar collaborations. Earlier this year, 8Bitdo released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Mechanical-Bluetooth-Backlight-Programmable/dp/B0DP9B2WYY/">Retro 87 keyboard</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Optical-Wireless-Charging-Programmable-Switches/dp/B0DMVLD2HC/">Retro R8 Mouse</a>, both of which are also equipped with the same Translucent Green shell from the original Xbox.</p><p>8Bitdo also added a bit of extra flair, as the directional keys are translucent and aim to match up with the ABXY colors from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Wired-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited/dp/B09FYFT4NN/">Duke</a>. Now, I want to see what other accessory makers can come up with, provided that devices or accessories are created with some guidance from Microsoft.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfwSiWwGbiY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>That last little bit is important, as it's not like the idea of attempting to invoke nostalgia is new. Far from it. However, most of the time, there's a difference when a company just tries to do something on its own versus when it's able to work with whatever company made the original. And I can't help but feel like that shows very well here.</p><p>Last year, Sony refreshed its lineup of devices to celebrate the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/30th-anniversary/">30th anniversary of the original PlayStation</a>. Unfortunately, I missed out on getting my hands on any of those before the scalpers got there, but I keep thinking about how it was also a missed opportunity. Imagining a Backbone One styled like the 30th anniversary DualSense would be simply incredible, and you can bet the house that I would have tried to buy one.</p><p>Just like how I immediately ordered the new Xbox Edition as soon as I saw that it was announced.</p>

But the product I used the most was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-aura-4k-ultra-short-throw-laser-projector-review">Aura</a>; I had the ultra short throw (UST) laser projector in my bedroom, and it did a fabulous job. <br><br>That's why I was excited when XGIMI released the Aura 2; it has a much better design that's in line with the rest of the brand's devices, and it doesn't take up anywhere as much room. The best part is that it gets noticeably brighter, and with Dolby Vision integration, it has better image quality. The Aura 2 usually costs $2,699, but it's finally going on sale and can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK">bought for $2,294 on Amazon</a> as of writing.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a laser projector with vibrant colors and great sound. The Aura 2 gets bright enough that there are no issues using the projector during the day, and this is an area where it has a considerable advantage over most of its rivals. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You don't like the Android TV interface.</p>
<p>I need to start with the design, because this is an area where XGIMI made several tweaks. The Aura 2 doesn't take up anywhere as much room, and this is a big deal in a projector; I had issues slotting in a soundbar in front of its predecessor as the Aura had a massive profile, but it just isn't a problem with the Aura 2. <br><br>The design looks much better as well; XGIMI went with a fabric design interlaced with metal, and it easily looks like a high-end projector. My favorite design feature is the motorized lid; it protects the lens when the Aura 2 is not in use, and not having to clean dust from this area is a huge relief.</p>

<p>The smooth curves along with the tan color combination means the Aura 2 blends into the background much better than any other laser projector I used until now. XGIMI did all the right things in this area, and the minimal aesthetic gives the Aura a definite edge. It doesn't get as loud either, and although the design is considerably sleeker than its predecessor, it does a good job with thermal management thanks to active cooling. <br><br>The projector is packed with features; it uses XGIMI's latest autofocus and wall adjustment algorithms, and it takes less time to adjust keystone settings than its predecessor. Another cool addition is the ability to adjust the image quality based on the color of the wall; this makes a considerable difference in daily use. The Aura 2 nails the connectivity; it has Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, two HDMI ports at the back and one HDMI eARC, three USB-A ports, 3.5mm out as well as optical, and Ethernet.</p>

<p>The biggest differentiator with the Aura 2 is the projection; it uses a dual laser light source and goes up to 2300 lumens, delivering a significantly brighter image than its predecessor. Basically, it gets so bright that there aren't any issues using it even with ambient light — I had no problems with the projector in daylight use. <br><br>Having used the Aura for two years, I can confidently say that the picture quality of the Aura 2 is much better. It has excellent color vibrancy and contrast, and there's no graininess to the image whatsoever even at a 100-inch projection. It goes up to 150 inches, and the image quality is one of the best of any UST projector I used until now.</p>

<p>It even has Dolby Vision, and HDR content looks outstanding on the projector. There's a built-in game mode as well that lowers the latency to 20ms, but switching to this mode disables keystone correction, so you will need to adjust the positioning manually. <br><br>There's great built-in sound as well thanks to a quartet of 15W drivers, but I'd recommend getting a soundbar to use with the Aura 2 to make the most of the projector. XGIMI bundles a metal remote with the projector, and it has a good in-hand feel and access to all the settings.</p>

<p>XGIMI didn't go with Google TV, instead using Android TV 11.0. The interface is decent enough and fluid most of the time, and you get unique extras; XGIMI Wall is a recent addition that allows you to cycle through dynamic backgrounds, and it is fun to use. As with every other projector, I switched over to the Shield TV Pro as it's faster and has a better feature-set, and it unlocks the potential of the Aura 2. <br><br>Overall, XGIMI did a magnificent job with the Aura 2; the projector has a much better design, and it isn't any hassle to set up and use. The picture quality is the main reason to pick up this projector, with XGIMI delivering one of the best laser light sources in this category. It gets bright, has excellent colors, and does a fantastic job with HDR content in general. Basically, the Aura 2 has everything I need in a UST projector, and if you're looking to upgrade, this is the one to get.</p><p>XGIMI doesn't usually put its UST projectors on sale, so the fact that you're getting a decent 15% discount is a big deal. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK">in at $2,294</a>, the projector is that much more affordable, and while that's still quite costly, you are getting what is arguably one of the best 4K UST projectors around.</p>
