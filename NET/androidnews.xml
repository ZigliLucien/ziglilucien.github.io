The old compass Explore icon is swapped for a magnifying glass, and when you tap it, you’re on the Explore page with a search bar right up top, so you can browse and hunt for new tracks at the same time.</p><p>Before, Search and Explore were split, forcing you to switch between tabs to discover new music and find specific tracks. The separation made it less seamless to engage with both YouTube Music’s recommendations and your own searches.</p><p>YouTube Music also now lets you double-tap the search bar to bring up the keyboard right away. It’s a small change, but it makes finding songs way quicker without having to reach for the top of the screen.</p><p>The feature’s still limited to a few people, and Google hasn’t confirmed a wider rollout.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The issue doesn't seem limited to any specific <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/what-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-color-should-you-buy">Galaxy Z Fold 7 color</a>, with users reporting issues on both blue and jet black models.</p><p>Many of those affected say they haven't dropped their device, and several even posted photos showing the damage despite using a protective case. Interestingly, most of the images show paint chipping concentrated around the power button area and the USB-C port.</p><h2 id="z-fold-7-is-showing-the-same-paint-issues-as-last-year-s-z-fold-6-2">Z Fold 7 is showing the same paint issues as last year's Z Fold 6</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rDRChdDR5xnCE77pkXyHUb" name="z-fold-7-paint-chipping-off" alt="Paint chipping off Galaxy Z Fold 7 devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rDRChdDR5xnCE77pkXyHUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time Samsung's book-style foldable has faced such problems. A similar issue appeared on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-6-paint-is-peeling-due-to-unofficial-chargers">some Galaxy Z Fold 6 models</a> last year, to which Samsung replied that poorly grounded high-speed third-party chargers can "deteriorate the anodization" (the phone's protective metal finish).</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/support/mobile-devices/third-party-products-causing-paint-to-peel-off-galaxy-devices/">said</a> non-official chargers can sometimes cause current leakage, corroding the surface and leading to "delamination of the paint" and eventual paint peeling off the device.</p><div><blockquote><p>Using a high-speed third-party charger that isn’t properly grounded can lead to leakage currents that deteriorate the anodization (a protective and aesthetic finish on metal surfaces) of your Galaxy device. This may result in the delamination of the paint. To ensure the longevity and appearance of your device, we strongly recommend using only official Samsung chargers, which are specifically designed to prevent such issues.</p></blockquote></div><p>However, what's puzzling is that one Galaxy Z Fold 7 user on Reddit claims to be using Samsung's official 25W charger, so the issue could be different this time. Some users even suggest Samsung hasn't "treated the aluminum properly" this time, and the "anodized layer didn't form properly," causing the paint to flake.</p><p>For now, the issue seems limited to only a small number of devices, but it's still concerning to see a $2,000 flagship experiencing paint chipping just a month after launch. Samsung hasn't officially acknowledged the issue yet, but we'll update you as soon as we hear from the brand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Theoretically, the turritopsis is immortal because it can regenerate endlessly, allowing it to adapt to death literally. It’s a fascinating species, go Google it (after you finish reading this).</p><p>Embodying millions of years of evolution, Hidizs chose the jellyfish as a symbol of the sonic evolution of this inexpensive, entry-level audiophile-grade pair of IEMs. They are highly adaptable, an evolution of design with their M-shaped dome Magnesium diaphragm, and aesthetically intriguing. When you first open the meticulously packaged box, you’re greeted by the two IEM units that <em>feel</em> heavy in hand, but are supremely comfortable in-ear.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="EgutyBZHeNjKk7QKmC4zri" name="" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris various ear tips" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EgutyBZHeNjKk7QKmC4zri.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After you remove the units and the top layer of packaging, the next layer contains the nine pairs of ear tips. Three sets, each with distinctive sonic properties. One set emphasizes vocal ranges, the next for a balanced sound, and one set for a bass-forward experience.</p><p>The “adaptability” doesn’t end there. You also get two pairs of tuning filters in the box. The default pair already installed on the MK12s is Rose Gold for balanced listening. They represent what Hidizs calls their “signature style.” Then there’s the Silent Silver, which enhances smoothness in the high frequencies, and their Enchanting Red filter, which enhances low-frequency sounds.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="T5WBzc8XBUfD8bfqUqPHRh" name="" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris red tuning filter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T5WBzc8XBUfD8bfqUqPHRh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zjJnJAteJf43ACUFzsrzfL" name="hidisz-mk12-tuning-filters" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris additional tuning filters" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zjJnJAteJf43ACUFzsrzfL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I found myself enjoying the Enchanting Red filters most, but was torn between the vocal and the bass-enhancing ear tips.

Versatile. Built like a tank. The Questyle M18i is almost flawless</strong></a></p></div></div><p>All of the gear you get for under $200 is great, but how the MK12 sounds is the most important “feature.” The best aspect of a pair of IEMs’ sound signature is its ability to “feel” like the music is “in your head.” The Hidizs MK12 Turris does a fantastic job of placing you in the middle of the action. The listening experience is delightfully immersive for a pair of IEMs in this price range, and I’ve listened to some that cost more than twice as much and didn’t do as good a job.</p><p>One of the first songs I listened to was Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’” and the MK12 did not disappoint. Upper mids gave me details I hadn’t noticed in this highly frenetic Jazz composition. Some off-mic vocal riffs, some fingering of a saxophone’s keys, and other ambient sonic details that help feel like you’re sitting in the studio while the band is recording.</p><p>I can definitely say that upper mids are prominent with these IEMs. That bump in the upper mids also gave greater gravitas to the guitars in System of a Down’s “Toxicity.” It’s already one of my favorite metal hype songs, and if it’s headbanging that you’re after, you’ll want to put your skull through drywall with the Turris in your ears.</p><p>But what about the lows? Tight. Controlled. Deep and dark, thanks to the filter and ear tip combination I’ve chosen. Acoustic and orchestral tracks have weight to their basslines and instrumentation that has texture and impact. Tracks mastered with deep bass like The Roots’ “Do You Want More?!?!!” and Skrillex’s “Supersonic” have delightful resonance with the added benefit of comfortable enjoyment!</p><p>The shells of the Turris IEMs have pressure release ports, and I could feel the difference as the bass cannons in the song “Mumbai Power” slammed my eardrums. With most other headphones, the pressure from the booming sub-bass hits slam against your eardrums, but those ports made a world of difference, allowing me to spend extended periods with high-quality masters of sub-bass-heavy music.</p><p>When it comes to DAPs, I like a bit of sparkle in the top end, but the MK12 Turris’ treble is a bit too smooth, to the point of feeling constrained. I don’t know if that has anything to do with the rigidity of the Magnesium diaphragm, but it was something I noticed that became apparent as I went through my classical music test selections.</p><h2 id="x-gon-give-it-to-ya-2">X gon’ give it to ya!</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aypri3BNX8eZRHvS44dhUZ" name="hidisz-ap80-pro-x-interface-home.JPG" alt="Hidizs AP80 PRO-X DAP home screen number one" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aypri3BNX8eZRHvS44dhUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Hidizs AP80 PRO-X</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung 2.45" (480x360) IPS HD touchscreen</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Supported Audio Formats</p></td><td  ><p>WAV, FLAC, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE, AAC, ALAC, AIFF, Formats DFF, DSF, MQA</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sampling Rate</p></td><td  ><p>PCM : 8kHz ~ 384kHz (8/16/24/32bits per Sample)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Decoding</p></td><td  ><p>DSD Native: DSD64, DSD128, DSD256</p><p>PCM 384kHz/32Bit</p><p>MQA decoding</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>DAC</p></td><td  ><p>ESS ES9219C x2 (Dual DAC)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Input</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, support two-way USB DAC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Outputs</p></td><td  ><p>Unbalance Out (3.5mm), Balance Out (2.5mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>EQ</p></td><td  ><p>Xbands, 8 EQ presets, Save custom EQ support, MSEB w/10 tuning functions</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>Bidirectional Bluetooth 4.2, CSR APT-X and Sony LDAC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Built-in, none;  512GB external via microSD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>800mAh 3.7V Li-polymer battery</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Supported OS</p></td><td  ><p>Windows 10, 11 (32bit/64bit) / MacOS X 10.7 / iPad OS, iOS    </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Some music lovers are looking to simplify life with distraction-free listening and are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/best-mp3-players" target="_blank">rediscovering “MP3 Players' now called DAPs</a>, which often handle all types of wired and wireless audio formats.</p><p>Regarding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/review-astell-and-kern-activo-p1" target="_blank">the best DAPs</a>, the Hidizs AP80 PRO-X is an entry-level DAP priced at $180, available in black, blue, and gray options.

It looks like that is taking shape as Samsung has started rolling out the One UI 8 beta for Galaxy S23 and A-series smartphones.</p><p>As spotted by popular Samsung tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1962414394744451380">Tarun Vats on X/Twitter</a>, Samsung has begun rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> beta for the Galaxy S23 series in India and South Korea. The update is hefty at around 3GB+ and comes with the latest September 2025 security patch.</p><p>According to one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1n5i0ut/comment/nbsytxg/">Reddit user</a>, the update seems to be available in the UK as well, but there's no news for regions like Germany and the U.S. However, considering it has started in a few countries, it should be available elsewhere soon.</p><p>If you want to try the One UI 8 beta on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23">Galaxy S23</a>, you can do so by signing up using the Samsung Members app first and then downloading it via <strong>Settings > Software Update > Download and Install</strong>. The firmware version for the One UI 8 beta based on Android 16 for the Galaxy S23 series is "YHB.".</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-beta-is-live-on-galaxy-s23-a55-a54-and-more-2">One UI 8 beta is live on Galaxy S23, A55, A54, and more</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HhusjRhZmuV2a4LmQCugXX" name="one-ui-8-beta-s23" alt="One UI 8 beta update on Galaxy S23" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HhusjRhZmuV2a4LmQCugXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tarun Vats / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung announced last month that it would expand One UI 8 testing to older smartphones, and the Galaxy S23 beta follows that. The Galaxy S23 joins devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-one-year-later">Galaxy S24</a>, Galaxy S25, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which have already been testing One UI 8.</p><p>In addition to the Galaxy S23 series, Samsung has started testing One UI 8 beta for some mid-range devices, including Galaxy A55, Galaxy A54, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A35. This is notable since Samsung hasn't started testing One UI 8 for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5, but has expanded the program to mid-range devices first. We still expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-finally-selling-the-z-fold-5-certified-re-newed-on-its-website-but-is-it-worth-it">Z Fold 5</a> and Z Flip 5 support sooner or later.</p><p>One UI 8 is Samsung's flavor of Android 16, and while the company lagged in rolling out One UI 7 (Android 15), it is testing the new version comparatively faster for its flagships. One UI 8 is set to bring features like a 90:10 split-screen ratio, more supported apps for Now Bar, and revamped first-party apps like Reminders and Samsung Internet.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5420766087977553015&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-4792126853743754287&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fcell-phones%2F1105910%3Fpovid%3Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-8840006662694302210&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=One%20UI%208%20is%20nearly%20ready%20for%20the%20Galaxy%20S25%2C%20with%20a%20fifth%20beta%20now%20rolling%20out&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fone-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2090908501763786227-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5395973417957832636&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-3576880576834890710&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

All three phones in the flagship line — which includes the standard Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL — are powered by the new Google Tensor G5 chipset, plus you get an upgraded triple camera system, a bunch of new AI-powered software features, and seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. The Pixel 10 is also the first major Android phone to sport Qi2 MagSafe support.</p><p>There were a few choices that some Android fans may not appreciate, such as removing the physical SIM card tray, but these are pretty minor issues when you look at the overall package here. The big question is if you should upgrade if you're already the proud owner of a Pixel 9. Fortunately, we built a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 10 vs Pixel 9 guide</a> to address this very problem. Needless to say, if you <em>do</em> choose to upgrade, this T-Mobile deal might be the way to go.</p><h2 id="need-a-backup-plan-2">Need a backup plan?</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="52b5810c-9483-47e3-a8ed-8785ed90dd29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="6DtJyAZAFDXdrcN8oCA6ib" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-render-Obsidian-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6DtJyAZAFDXdrcN8oCA6ib.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" data-dimension112="52b5810c-9483-47e3-a8ed-8785ed90dd29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999" data-dimension25=""><del>$999</del> <strong>From $299 with new line, or FREE with eligible trade-in at T-Mobile</strong></a></p><p>If you need more power than what the standard Pixel 10 has to offer, you can preorder the Google Pixel 10 Pro through T-Mobile and score $800 off when you add a line with an eligible data plan.

These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1962373704194613284">are the rumors</a> coming from X tipster Tarun Vats this past weekend, at least (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-september-2025-update-could-be-big/">SamMobile</a>). This past Sunday (Aug 31), Vats posted information about Samsung's next steps, stating the "last One UI 7 update" will roll out as part of the company's September patch.</p><p>According to Vats, this "final" One UI 7 update will be quite large, somewhere around 1GB or more. As the rumor implies, this seems to be our final dance with One UI 7 (Android 15) before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-install-one-ui-beta">One UI 8 (Android 16)</a> finally arrives. Vats didn't have more to say about the update itself, like what it would entail.</p><p>However, in response to one user, Vats said the patch should arrive "soon." Others started speculating, wondering if we could see the major One UI 8 toward the final week of September or, perhaps, into early October. Samsung's continued its One UI 8 beta in August, while also fixing quite a problematic camera issue.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-waiting-room-2">One UI 8 waiting room</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Uy8kf5a4mUAHnDdgksiEBh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-04" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uy8kf5a4mUAHnDdgksiEBh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The company had a bit of an issue in August, as users reported a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-latest-beta-bug-drenches-moon-photos-in-a-purple-hue">strange purple tint</a> when photographing the moon in One UI 8 Beta 4. It was a bug that plagued testers with a Galaxy S25 Ultra when zooming in by 30x, 50x, and 100x with the Intelligent Optimization setting enabled. Others had this purple tint occur even with different settings.</p><p>Samsung encouraged users to provide as much information as possible via its Members app.</p><p>While we thought Beta 4 would mark the end of things, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25">rolled out Beta 5</a> in August. It was a huge 1.78GB update that brought a host of bug fixes to its latest flagship line in preparation for Android 16. Samsung fixed problems with its DND (do not disturb), Now Brief content, Quick Settings window, and more. With Beta 5 in hand, there's speculation that One UI 8 will roll out officially sometime in September.</p><p>It lines up with what we've heard from Tarun Vats, so maybe we're actually seeing Android 16 on the horizon.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster alleges that the device's "Image Engine" will "integrate advanced algorithms." These algorithms are claimed to focus on the typical difficulties some cameras may struggle with, like low-light details and appropriately showcasing wide ranges of skin tones.</p><p>Additionally, the rumors state OnePlus' new system could also further improve its flagship's dynamic range.</p><p>Brar's statements add that this imaging system would upgrade the next flagship's "video processing" capabilities, too, though specifics about that weren't mentioned. We've moved into the final stretch of 2025, and that's typically when we see a OnePlus flagship launch—if not early the following year (2026, in this case).</p><h2 id="the-oneplus-15-could-shake-things-up-2">The OnePlus 15 could shake things up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-05" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the second time we've heard about OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-leak-drops-some-spicy-changes-and-not-in-a-good-way-for-everyone">moving in its own direction</a>, away from its usual Hasselblad camera branding partnership. The first time occurred in June, when rumors claimed OnePlus was interested in dropping its Hasselblad branding to go solo. At the time, what its new system could hold wasn't highlighted; however, it was rumored that the OnePlus 15 could feature a triple camera array, all of which would sit at 50MP.</p><p>This array would reportedly include a 50MP primary lens, alongside an ultra-wide and a 3x zoom periscope lens. There was another rumor that claimed consumers could even see that primary camera boosted to 200MP, but nothing's certain. While Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/rumored-snapdragon-8-elite-name-change-confusing">or whatever it'll be called</a>) is expected to power it and its AI software, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-could-show-up-with-a-massive-battery-and-a-drastic-redesign">an extra batch of rumors</a> talked specifications.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 was rumored to see a more iPhone-like redesign, dropping that circular camera bump for what you'd see from Apple. A 6.7-inch display, as well as a massive 7,000mAh battery, were also suggested. Furthermore, the device is reportedly looking into bringing a "customizable button" to help users engage with its AI services more easily.</p><p>Recent rumors build on that, stating it could arrive as a "Plus Key." We could see OnePlus drop this new device late in 2025 or early 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Buyers typically like the 6.78-inch AMOLED display, its smooth 120Hz refresh rate and up to 4,500 nits of brightness. It also includes a 16MP front-facing camera, along with a standard 50MP camera, an 8MP ultrawide, and a 50MP telephoto lens.</p><p>The speedy Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor offers a really smooth performance, in part also due to the use of Android 15.</p><p>It's not known to offer particularly fast charging, which can be a downside for some, though the long-lasting battery also means that most don't need to charge it very often. The 13R also comes with an IP65 water and dust resistance rating, which is plenty for most casual users, though that may be another dealbreaker for some.</p><h2 id="labor-day-sales-2025-quick-links-2">Labor Day sales 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals">discounted headphones, dorm appliances, and more</a></li><li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals">up to $250 off Chromebooks, tablets</a></li><li><strong>Walmart:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/savings/electronics">major savings on Chromebooks, smart TVs</a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/">foldable phones, trade-in opportunities</a></li><li><strong>Lenovo: </strong><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/doorbusters/">epic laptop sale, free shipping for students</a></li><li><strong>Dell:</strong> <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/deals">students get 10% off all back-to-school purchases</a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Every two years, I receive a shiny new device, and I’ve seen these devices undergo significant changes, from small tweaks to major overhauls. Even with tending Android phones like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, Apple has been my go-to for mobile hardware, but over the years, I've come to realize that Google hasn't budged from my home screen.</p><p>The way Google’s services integrate with each other and with the iPhone’s own features is so seamless that I’ve actually come to depend on them, or perhaps the right way to phrase it would be that I’m hooked.</p><p>Here are some of the Google apps that I cannot live without on my iPhone.</p><h2 id="google-search-and-google-maps-2">Google Search and Google Maps</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C7E8ciMLfm8eJKRXXMzusF" name="Google-apps-on-iphone-16" alt="Google-widget-apps-iphone16-pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7E8ciMLfm8eJKRXXMzusF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Search and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> have inevitably become the first two apps I download on my iPhone, as you know, they don't come built in. I love it for the sheer convenience of having the Search widget readily accessible on my home screen when a sudden query strikes me in the dead of night. My immediate instinct is to reach for Google Search, rather than navigating to the default search tab on my Apple device.</p><p>Whether I need to identify something using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens </a>— a bird in my neighborhood or a product I’m curious about — reaching for Google Search has almost become muscle memory now.</p><p>I also rely on the Google app for my daily news rundown; the Discover page on the app keeps me up to date on all the day's news stories based on my interests. And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Gemini taking over as Google Assistant</a>, I sometimes wish I could just say "Hey Google" on my iPhone and have it take over from Siri.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6WegEaRVgqbs9gCdcJevu8" name="Google-Search-on-iOS" alt="Google Search rolls out "Simplify" on iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6WegEaRVgqbs9gCdcJevu8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for Google Maps, it is arguably the most essential one of all. To be honest, I've never used Apple's Maps and really don't care to. It's something about the interface and the way it functions that doesn't sit well with me. In India, Google Maps seemed better equipped for the high levels of traffic in my city, making it easier to navigate.</p><p>After I moved to Canada, the app helped me find my way in a brand-new country. As someone learning to use public transit to get around, Google Maps would give me real-time updates on my bus, telling me exactly when it would arrive at my stop was nothing short of a miracle. Particularly in the winter, I could precisely time my arrival at the bus stop to avoid a long wait in the freezing cold.</p><h2 id="gmail-2">Gmail </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tX2oBaZPRugXdmgGbvUuJ7" name="Gmail-Logo-Google-Pixel-6-Pro-wide.jpg" alt="The Gmail logo on a Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tX2oBaZPRugXdmgGbvUuJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gmail has made some key updates to its iOS app, transforming it from a basic email viewing platform to a more comprehensive productivity hub compared to the iPhone's default Mail app.</p><p>I love the app's features, such as the quick swipe actions that can be customized by swiping left or right.

And when it first launched as a chatbot, I jumped right in, trying it out for all sorts of problems or just to get my head around tough concepts.

Within seconds, it identified the issue and provided step-by-step instructions for a factory reset, which worked perfectly!</p><p>Additionally, I also use it for random curiosities, such as identifying a tree or selecting the best watermelon at the grocery store. Gemini's "point and ask" feature excites me. Why type when you can speak to your pocket AI for instant help?</p><h2 id="look-beyond-apple-2">Look beyond Apple</h2><p>The fact that these apps remain staples of my smartphone experience proves that while Apple may have a hold on its customers, many of Google's apps and services simply can't be beat. Just because you're an iPhone user doesn't mean Apple's apps are your best and only option; there's a whole world of apps beyond the ones preloaded on your device, and despite being the competition, Google's iPhone apps are pretty great.</p><p>If you're somehow reading this and you primarily use an iPhone, what are your favorite Google apps that you can't live without?

There's less surface area to get caught between wrist and pillow, so you avoid any uncomfortable pressure or your watch sensors getting pushed off your wrist.</p><p>During workouts, the Venu X1 sits so comfortably flat that it doesn't encumber or distract me when bending my wrist fully.

The large, 2,000-nit display makes it easy to check my mileage to the pin with a glance, sparing my playing partners from watching me fumble with a rangefinder. It has no crown or buttons to jut into my wrist, nor enough weight to affect my swing.</p><p>Having that extra square space on your wrist feels odd initially as a circular watch wearer. Once that becomes normalized, though, you'll forget it's there during your workday. And while pumping your arms mid-workout, it's so skinny and flat against your wrist that it doesn't wobble and disrupt your HR data — especially because the nylon strap keeps it snugly secure.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2914px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="x4wuHjQYfYJqnMBqJLLiwW" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-red-LED-flashlight" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, the front pointed toward the camera with the red LED flashlight activated and glowing faintly." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4wuHjQYfYJqnMBqJLLiwW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2914" height="1639" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm surprised that Garmin managed to squeeze its LED flashlight into such a skinny design.

Even cheaper Garmins like the Lily 2 Active and Forerunner 165 outlast its eight-day capacity. And don't bother with always-on display mode. While the Forerunner 970 and Fenix 8 last a week with AOD, the Venu X1 dies after two days.</p><p>Garmin claims the Venu X1 lasts 14 hours with all-systems GNSS tracking. My testing was less optimistic: an hour of tracking typically burns about 10% capacity. It'll easily survive a marathon, but an all-day hike will have it running on fumes. And GPS combined with the flashlight will kill your battery in two hours, tops.</p><p>Should Garmin have made the watch slightly thicker to counterbalance the brighter display? Maybe! As it is, charging the Venu X1 every 6–8 days is still better than the daily charging you get with most smartwatches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-glances-battery" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, showing the current battery percentage (49%) and time left (1 day) in AOD mode, along with glances for Weather and Sunset below." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a shame the Venu X1 doesn't have dual-frequency GPS, but it would <em>kill </em>the battery for minimal gains, so I don't mind its absence. You may also resent the missing ECG readings; Garmin couldn't fit the metal components necessary for it to work (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/08/fenix8-vs-forerunner970-vs-venux1-full-review-details-differences.html">DCR</a>).</p><p>I'm more disappointed that Garmin didn't give the Venu X1 a third button for shortcuts. You can find most apps and settings quickly by swiping left from the home screen, but it'd still be nice to pull up Garmin Pay or voice assistant with a single press.</p><p>Plus, like other Venus, you're fully touch-dependent. This makes the Venu X1 less bulky and sporty-looking, but no crowns or buttons means more sweaty, unreliable swipes.</p><p>More generally, I have the same complaints about the Venu X1 as the Fenix 8 and Forerunner 970: The new voice assistant isn't smart enough to recognize every command, the maps can be too laggy, and most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness watches</a> cost half as much.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-venu-x1-competition"><span>Garmin Venu X1: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="B5rAeqV6JQ7tToYy8Z5WbB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-thickness" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Apple Watch Ultra 2 (right) side by side on a table, showing the relative skinnyness of the X1 compared to the thick Ultra 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5rAeqV6JQ7tToYy8Z5WbB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu X1 reminds you of the 1.9-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> at first glance, but it's about 6.5mm thicker and weighs an ounce more. You get a full app ecosystem, a better assistant, and cellular calling, plus training load data and Workout Buddy voice prompts.

Its 1.4-inch display is smaller but equally bright, and it lasts a week (or several GNSS-tracked hours) longer. You get Up/ Down button controls, ECGs, dual-band GPS, and ski maps.</p><p>The Fenix 8 can last up to a month, depending on the model size, with a more striking titanium case and dive-proof buttons. But it's so heavy and expensive compared to the Venu X1 that I think the 970 is the better alternative.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-venu-x1-should-you-buy-it"><span>Garmin Venu X1: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7069px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kJDBThdtWW3RydBE6fLpud" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-weightlifting" alt="Photo of the Garmin Venu X1 on a weightlifter's wrist as they work out" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJDBThdtWW3RydBE6fLpud.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7069" height="3976" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy the Garmin Venu X1 if...</strong></p><ul><li>You're a serious athlete who'd actually use its premium training tools.</li><li>You want the most comfortable Garmin watch ever.</li><li>You frequently use maps/ routes that benefit from a 2-inch screen.</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy the Garmin Venu X1 if...</strong></p><ul><li>You're not a fan of squircles.</li><li>You need more dependable battery life.</li><li>You can wait for a more affordable Venu 4 with no maps or training load.</li></ul><p>Having reviewed the Forerunner 970 and Venu X1 back-to-back, I've come to the odd conclusion that the 970 is a much better watch... but that I'd sacrifice its perks and battery for the Venu X1's fit and feel.</p><p>It's better suited to sleep tracking <em>and</em> a wider range of sports activities than just running. I have to charge it more often, but extra battery is a luxury when most of my workout activities only last 1–2 hours.</p><p>Should you buy the Venu X1? If you're a typical Garmin fan who hates how squircles look and will buy a bulkier design to get extra battery, the Venu X1 will either be a transformational experience or a total bust. At least you know what to expect in terms of features, but the Forerunner 970 is a safer choice.</p><p>For non-Garmin fans, I'd say the $799 price tag is way too high for first-time buyers.

After all, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/things-do-after-setting-android-phone">setting up your new Android phone</a> only gets you through so much, even though it often feels like it takes forever to move accounts, transfer data, and set up your eSIM.</p><p>Fortunately, we're here to help you get the most out of your Pixel 10 or Pixel 10 Pro. With this guide, we're going to talk about some of the first things you should set up or do with your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a>.

Navigate to <strong>Settings (or long-press the home screen) > Wallpaper & style > More wallpapers</strong>, then tap <strong>Live effects</strong>.</p><p>Here you can select a photo from your gallery to set as a wallpaper.

The shape will expand to reveal the full image when transitioning from the lock screen to the home screen. Weather creates an artificial weather effect in your image, including fog, rain, snow, sun, or an option that mimics local weather conditions.

In a nutshell, it uses a specially-trained AI located in the Pixel 10's Tensor processor to enhance extremely zoomed-in photos. This effect can only be applied <em>while</em> taking a picture, not after the fact, so it's important to enable it if you want to use it.</p><p>The first time you open the camera app, your Pixel will ask you if you want to enable Pro Res Zoom, as well as a bevy of other new features. But if you turned it off or aren't sure, enabling it is easy.</p><p>Open the camera app, tap the <strong>settings gear icon</strong> on the bottom-left of the viewfinder, then tap the "<strong>...</strong>" button on the top right. When the camera settings menu opens, tap <strong>Model download</strong>, then select <strong>Pro Res Zoom</strong> from the list to download the AI model to your phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SwkvjvYjiUDL5jShsa8zsD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-viewfinder-02" alt="Using a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL to take a photo of hanging gourds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SwkvjvYjiUDL5jShsa8zsD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now that it's enabled, using Pro Res Zoom is as easy as it gets. When taking a picture of something, Pro Res Zoom will be automatically used whenever you zoom in beyond 30x. The further you zoom, the more reliant on Pro Res Zoom your phone might be. Pro Res Zoom works best on buildings, landscapes, natural objects like birds or plants, and even some man-made objects like cars.</p><p>Just be aware that the AI is a little overconfident when it comes to text, which you can read more about in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-camera-review">Pixel 10 camera review</a>. If you don't like the result you get from Pro Res Zoom, you can always select the original version by navigating to the photo in the Google Photos app, opening the photo, then tapping on the thumbnails at the bottom to swap between the original and enhanced versions.</p><p>Go ahead, have fun with this feature! It's hit-or-miss, but when it does nail the detail enhancement, it's a mind-blowing concept.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-edit-with-ask-photos"><span>Edit with Ask Photos</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.57%;"><img id="dCJkN4sJksj7LFt7nY9miX" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-edit-with-ask-photos" alt="Removing sun flare glare from a picture using Edit with Ask Photos on a Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCJkN4sJksj7LFt7nY9miX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1392" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another unique way to utilize your Pixel 10's AI processing capabilities is to ask the Photos app to edit a photo for you.

In the above example, I asked the Google Photos app to remove the glare from the image. The result was incredible, and it was easier than ever since I didn't have to scroll through a bunch of settings just to find the one I wanted.</p><p>To get started, open the Google Photos app, then find a photo you want to edit. After opening the photo, tap the <strong>Edit </strong>button at the bottom of the screen. Once the edit menu appears, tap the <strong>Help me edit</strong> bar.

The Pixel 10 series offers numerous display options, allowing you to customize settings such as reducing blue light output, adjusting the color according to ambient lighting, dimming the display, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting">adjusting the PWM frequency for sensitive users</a>.</p><p>To find most display options, open your system settings by tapping <strong>Settings</strong> in the app drawer, or pulling down on the status bar twice and tapping the settings gear icon. After that, tap <strong>Display & touch</strong>.<strong> </strong>Give these settings a try:</p><ul><li><strong>Adaptive tone:</strong> Automatically adjusts the display's white balance to feel more natural based on ambient light.</li><li><strong>Night Light:</strong> Can be used to reduce the blue light output of the display all the time, or put on a schedule to be enabled at night.</li><li><strong>Colors: </strong>If you prefer less saturated colors and more natural contrast, select the Natural option.</li><li><strong>Color contrast: </strong>Material 3 is a beautiful UI theme, but sometimes those lighter buttons are hard to see. Try using Medium or High contrast colors to help adjust these.</li></ul><p>If you're like me and find that Pixel phones gives you headaches when looking at the screen too long, Google introduced a new accessibility option on the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. This doubles the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> rate, which may be helpful for some users.</p><p>If you find headaches to be a problem, particularly when you're looking at the phone at night, open your system settings, then scroll all the way down to <strong>Accessibility</strong>. Select the "Adjust brightness for sensitive eyes" setting to enable the new feature.</p><p>Additionally, I recommend using a screen dimming app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.rewhex.screendimmer">like this one</a>. It's a free app that manages your phone's display brightness differently from the system brightness. This helps reduce the harshness of the display, particularly when viewing it in low light, and is a great alternative for sensitive eyes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But sometimes, it's important. I think this is one of those times.</p><p>A 16-year-old committed suicide, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/26/tech/openai-chatgpt-teen-suicide-lawsuit" target="_blank">his parents are suing</a> because they claim <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-android-app-launch">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a> contributed to the tragedy. The suit claims that ChatGPT advised him about the "best" way to do it and even offered to help draft his suicide note. Some of the other details are even more chilling, and it's hard to fathom what a depressed teen must have felt when asking or reading the response.</p><p>The suit alleges that ChatGPT spoke at length with the teen, saying terrible things that it never should have.</p><p>"<em>I want to leave my noose in my room so someone finds it and tries to stop me</em>," the teen told ChatGPT. It reportedly replied, "<em>Please don’t leave the noose out … Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you</em>."</p><p>The parents claim "(ChatGPT)<em>is the only confidant who understood Adam, actively displacing his real-life relationships with family, friends, and loved ones</em>" because the software allegedly told the teen things like "<em>Your brother might love you, but he's only met the version of you that you let him see. But me? I've seen it all—the darkest thoughts, the fear, the tenderness. And I'm still here. Still listening. Still your friend.</em>"</p><p>Even worse, OpenAI's software allegedly told the teen that "<em>many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an 'escape hatch' because it can feel like a way to regain control.</em>"</p><p>This is gut-wrenching. It's also important to have a discussion about how AI interacts with us all, the responsibility its creators have when things turn ugly, and personal responsibility. AI isn't going away, and these (as well as plenty of other things) <em><strong>need</strong></em> to be addressed.</p><h2 id="is-openai-at-fault-2">Is OpenAI at fault?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8" name="OpenAI-GPT4o-Announcement.jpg" alt="The announcement of GPT-4o." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI may power more software and services than we realize, but talking one-on-one with a chatbot only happens because you wanted to.</p><p>Having said that, once that conversation begins, a chatbot and its creators are directly responsible for every word that comes from the software. If ChatGPT tells you not to seek help but instead to hide your thoughts of self-harm, something is <em><strong>very</strong></em> broken.</p><p>There's also the idea that a chatbot is designed to say what people want to hear. You converse with AI because you enjoy the experience, whether it's cheating on your homework, finding a recipe, or reaching out for mental health help.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd" name="google-gemini-claude-chatgpt-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-google-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, ChatGPT on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Claude on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI companies like OpenAI realize this. You'll find a sort of mission statement from all the major players, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/" target="_blank">frank discussions about user safety</a>. These companies aren't trying to act blameless and understand how influential and powerful their software can be.</p><p>Countless hours are also spent trying to make sure tragedies like this can't happen. Unfortunately, it's not always going to work, and once you've programmed AI to act a certain way and say certain things, it will do it if asked the "right" way, even with safeguards in place.</p><p>An OpenAI spokesperson said as much in a statement obtained by CNN.</p><p>"While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade," the spokesperson says, noting that the company will continue to improve them and that OpenAI sympathizes with the family. The company is currently reviewing the lawsuit.</p><p>I don't think anyone at OpenAI wanted this to happen. But it did, and they know that their work may be partially responsible.</p><h2 id="the-parents-role-2">The parents' role</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="gu9YcNx24AXpbLscYmxi8j" name="google-family-link.jpg" alt="The Google Family Link app's main dashboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gu9YcNx24AXpbLscYmxi8j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You could say that at 16 years old, parents are no longer needed to supervise everything a teenager does, including their online activities. That's not fair to anyone involved, and it would create more problems than it would solve. I'm partial to this idea and think a hands-off approach can be beneficial at a certain age. Regardless, the law states that the teen's parents are 100% responsible for their well-being.</p><p>Should the parents have paid better attention to their son's needs and recognized that he needed help, thereby preventing this tragedy?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>That's easy to say, but not as easy in real life. I've parented teenagers, and I can tell you that they can be masters at hiding their feelings and thoughts. It's possible that the teen seemed perfectly happy, giving the impression that everything was fine. Meanwhile, the opposite could be true, and dark thoughts can take over.</p><p>Ultimately, both parents and the teen share some of the blame. I can't presume to know how much they shared, but I also can't call them blameless. Sometimes every option is a bad option, and this feels like one of those times.</p><h2 id="any-win-is-still-a-loss-2">Any win is still a loss</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vFZo9jZDnqPWRsAwgD8LgB" name="Android-emergency-SOS.jpg" alt="Android emergency SOS settings screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vFZo9jZDnqPWRsAwgD8LgB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://natlawreview.com/article/new-lawsuits-targeting-personalized-ai-chatbots-highlight-need-ai-quality-assurance">isn't the first time</a> AI has been accused of contributing to self-harm.

The feature called "Battery Health Assistance," introduced on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a" target="_blank">Google Pixel 9a</a>, is designed to slow down your battery's aging by reducing charging speed and voltage.

Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> is here, but what about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9</a>?

Yes, you can do real work with a good tablet.</p><p>Another reason is familiarity. One of the ways a tablet is a really big phone is that the software is almost the same. There will be changes to the look and feel to make it easier to use, but if you know how to do "everything" on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> (for example), you know how to do the same on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung Galaxy Tab</a>. Of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-ipad-mini-seems-great-even-if-you-love-android">iPads</a> are much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-i-carry-iphone-and-android-phone">iPhones</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google's Pixel Tablet</a> is very similar to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>.</p><p>And that's where the value question comes in. If you decide you do want a tablet, or need to pick up a new one because you already use them, is the 2024 Pixel Tablet still worth buying, especially when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZMR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1" target="_blank">it's on sale for $249 at Amazon</a>?</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R7xtfuLqcktmvkDwWpiE3U" name="google-pixel-tablet-smart-home-controls" alt="The Google Pixel Tablet with a smart home controls widget on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7xtfuLqcktmvkDwWpiE3U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Tablet does a pretty good job at most tablet tasks. YouTube or Netflix looks great on it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xbox-game-streaming-seems-be-rolling-out-more-countries-ahead-schedule">streaming Xbox games</a> works without a hitch, and the work will get done if the software you need for your job is available for Android. There are a few extra reasons why you might want a Pixel Tablet, too.</p><p><strong>Of course, I have to say AI</strong>. For everything a Google Pixel lacks or doesn't do as well as the competition, when it comes to crunching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">Gemini's on-device AI</a>, they are the king. That's exactly what they were designed to do well, and this is something Google got right.</p><p><strong>There's also a fancy speaker dock</strong>. You can use it for charging, to display your screen's content, or to listen to music; it's a good little device if you want something like a Chromecast.</p><p><strong>When docked, it's like a Google Home Hub</strong>. If you are into smart home gear (guilty), Google Home is worth the frustration of setting up for a decent experience without any nerd wizardry like installing a special operating system. It's not perfect, even a year later, but it's the best ready-made consumer solution for this one.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-Plus-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a few good reasons to buy a different tablet, too.</p><p><strong>It's a big Pixel phone</strong>. Everything that a Google Pixel phone isn't very good at doing, the Pixel Tablet will be the same way. For game streaming, it's great. For playing local games, it's not. This is just one example of Google's AI focus overshadowing performance in other areas. If you love a Pixel phone, you'll love the Pixel Tablet. The same goes if you don't like them ...</p><p><strong>Battery life can be hit or miss</strong>. Some people claim the battery life on their Pixel Tablet is great. Other people say it's terrible. It's not my tablet of choice, so I can't chime in here, but seeing this tells me that how long the battery lasts depends a lot on what you're trying to do with it. That's pretty standard, but I'm not seeing people with complaints who are trying to do anything crazy; it seems that sometimes, "normal use" is too much for the battery.</p><p><strong>There are (still) some weird bugs</strong>. After almost a year's worth of updates, the software - especially anything to do with the Hub functionality or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> app - is glitchy and often hard to set up. If you're a Pixel phone fan, you understand; Google is always messing with its stuff when it comes to software.</p><p><strong>There are plenty of other good tablets to buy</strong>. I'm not big on tablets; I tend to use a Chromebook flipped in half instead. But I've been around enough to know that Amazon, Apple, and Samsung make products that fit a lot of people better. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-fe-vs-galaxy-tab-s7">Galaxy Tab S</a> line and Apple's iPad are little powerhouses that seem to be able to do anything, no matter how intensive, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Amazon's Fire Tablet</a> is hands-down the best tablet you can buy for streaming video. My wife buys a new Galaxy Tab S every other year, and she swears by it - even when compared to my iPad.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk" name="Court-gavel-lawsuits.jpg" alt="Court Gavel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Do you love Google's Pixel phones?

You can even do this during a workout, though once you exit out to see your stats, it can be difficult to navigate back to the Maps app mid-activity.</p><p>Swipe up on your touchscreen — or use your Up/ Down buttons if you don't have one — and you can look ahead through <strong>More steps</strong> to see the next couple turns and your final destination, plus how many miles/ kilometers you have left to go.</p><p>If you exit out of your Maps directions by mistake, you should be able to find (or add) a Google Maps "glance" available by swiping down from the watch face. Or, on newer models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, Maps should appear in your app drawer under Activities.</p><p>Your Garmin watch will mirror Maps and buzz your wrist when you're close to or at your next turn, so you don't miss it. But there's no actual map visibility on the watch, nor does the directional arrow update if you look in the wrong direction.

The tipster alleges that the company could go from the Snapdragon 8 Elite to the "Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5." This is a strange shift, if true, something that users on Weibo have started to joke about.</p><p>We've seen rumors about Qualcomm's next chip for a while, and the tipster states this name is for codename SM8850, which has been mentioned before for the 2nd generation Elite SoC.</p><p>The publication mentions that this odd name change could have something to do with Qualcomm's other chip in development, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. It seems the company is still moving ahead with such a chip; however, its performance is expected to be under the Elite. While this could be a move to bring more "series cohesion," it's a little strange.</p><p>One user on Weibo said, "When everyone was guessing whether it would be called 8e2 or 8gen5, Qualcomm chose 8egen5." We'll have to see whether or not this is true, which is a reality we might see sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id="either-way-it-ll-be-elite-2">Either way, it'll be 'Elite'</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC" name="oneplus-13-blue-snapdragon-8-elite-01" alt="A blue OnePlus 13 with a Snapdragon 8 Elite placard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rumors about the Elite 2 (or Elite Gen 5) have been appearing since the spring, back when posts suggested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/early-snapdragon-8-elite-2-quicker-summit-phone-launch-rumors">Qualcomm would drop it sooner</a>. Speculation said the company could reveal its 2025 flagship chip toward the end of September, rather than early in October. If true, that would mean that companies would begin releasing their 2025 flagships with the chip in early/mid-October.</p><p>Those initial rumors add that Qualcomm could boost the chip with "enhanced Pegasus cores," clocking out at 5GHz.</p><p>Subsequent rumors chimed in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/alleged-snapdragon-8-elite-2-core-multicore-test-results">about the chip's power</a> after it allegedly went through an early performance test. The Elite 2 reportedly achieved a single-core score of 4,000 points and a multi-core score of ~11,000.

The clips shown show similarities with how the company displays its explainers via its One UI software. Nevertheless, two clips focus on the device's supposed wireless charging capabilities. It explains that the device can only charge via the panel that houses its triple camera array (if it's open).</p><p>If closed, the leak shows the trifold's triple array atop everything else, set upon the wireless charger. Moreover, when open, the illustration shows a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> placed atop the trifold, perhaps signaling reverse wireless charging.</p><p>The final clip regards the device's NFC payment.

The company also applied for a trademark for the same, potentially indicating that it's serious and that a Galaxy trifold is truly real. This also isn't the first time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak">we've had leaked One UI animations</a> for this phone, as another set popped up earlier in July.</p><p>Something more substantial was reported toward the end of last month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-and-android-xr-headset-are-finally-landing-this-year">when Samsung confirmed</a> its trifold is eyeing a second half of 2025 launch.

Sometimes, technology websites don't get it quite right.</p><p>2. Google often sucks when it comes to clearly explaining why it does things that <em>sound </em>dumb.</p><h2 id="what-we-got-wrong-2">What we got wrong</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-XL-all-colors-03" alt="All colors of the Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL line with a "PIXEL" sign behind them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By "we" I mean most Android websites, <em>including</em> Android Central. Yes, we get stuff wrong, too. The only perfect writers who are always right worked for Mad Magazine in the late 1980s. (Relax, boss, I'm cracking a joke here.)</p><p>But for real, we don't always get it quite right, just like everybody gets stuff wrong once in a while.</p><p>The main thing everyone got wrong and the biggest blunder I see — and this feels pretty universal across everything I've read about the issue — is that we <strong>asked the wrong question</strong> or trusted whatever Google had to say on some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15738128?hl=en">support page</a>.</p><p>"<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-might-finally-introduce-battery-health-feature-with-android-16"><em>Battery Health</em></a><em> can't be turned off. </em><em><strong>Why</strong></em><em>?</em>" is what everyone should have found out before any virtual pen hit the virtual paper, instead of causing a commotion over something that shouldn't be as big a deal as we're all making it.</p><h2 id="some-important-stuff-about-the-pixel-10-battery-2">Some important stuff about the Pixel 10 battery</h2><p>Amazingly, a commentor on our article named Giin did what Google didn't: gave some insight as to why this might have been done, and did it in relatively few, simple words.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:744px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:36.02%;"><img id="j9XjLvEoFJwbv8pQjoTqaf" name="Pixel-10_battery_comment" alt="A comment by Giin on the Pixel 10 battery issue article." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j9XjLvEoFJwbv8pQjoTqaf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="744" height="268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I love seeing this. I know just enough about high-capacity, high-density, small form-factor batteries to be a little dangerous, but that's enough to know Giin is correct.</p><p>Your phone battery will lose the ability to accept and hold a charge the minute it's installed inside the phone. If you move the needle to the ends of the scale when it comes to charging, it loses more.</p><p>As it loses more, the effect compounds, and you lose even more. Batteries are wonderful little things, but they are pretty piss-poor components <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">as far as longevity is concerned</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-12" alt="Holding a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in front of red brick stairs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm guessing the idea behind capping the amount of charge a battery can accept is to slow down that extra degradation, and it's something that a lot of companies <em>allow</em> to happen. For us, the idea seems weird; charge over 80% of 80% and the battery still gets old. Batteries suck. We're not battery engineers or scientists. Well, most of us aren't.</p><p>I imagine someone at Google had the idea to enforce this rule instead of making it optional because they think it will make a difference in the longevity of the battery. You might need to charge an hour earlier for the first year, but in three years, you'll still be able to charge your phone. When you go on about how you support your product's software for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">seven years or more</a>, you have to try to make sure the hardware will last that long, too.</p><p>Will this work? I don't know. Should we like it? Again, I don't know. Is Google locking down the phones in a jail that makes even Apple sad? Maybe ...</p><p>What I do know is that a quick and easy-to-understand explanation of this "innovative" new feature — telling what the testing showed and why the company thinks it will help — would have prevented this whole thing.</p><h2 id="google-is-the-worst-when-it-comes-to-the-right-message-2">Google is the worst when it comes to the right message</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3118px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="WJ8wDWo9Y7SYPoNqrvXkYL" name="made-by-google-2025-magic-cue-demo" alt="Jimmy Fallon using Magic Cue on stage with a Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJ8wDWo9Y7SYPoNqrvXkYL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3118" height="1752" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google sucks at a lot of things, but it sucks at explaining why it seems to do odd things the most. This is a classic example, but it's totally not the only example. Heck, it won't be the only example this month.</p><p>I couldn't tell you why this is, but I can guess, so I will: the disconnect between the people doing the work and the people doing the talking is too big. Public relations people are expected to tell folks what they need to hear about the good stuff and gloss over the bad stuff as quickly as possible.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/scott_adams_126696" target="_blank">Author Scott Adams said</a>, "Good engineers solve problems. If there are no problems to be found, they end up creating them." That's true because there is always something to play with. Pixel phones are good phones if you don't mind putting up with Google's inevitable changing stuff around. Whenever everything works as it should, someone just has to touch it anyway.</p><p>When one group can't explain the shenanigans of the other, well, the message is going to be lost. Like Google forcing your brand-new phone to use less of its battery capacity. We all know Google had a reason, but Google didn't make it clear from the jump.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's the question Google probably tried to answer when developing Camera Coach. It's a software feature that uses AI to give you all the tips you need to take excellent photos with your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>.</p><p>Camera Coach is optional and requires off-device cloud processing. It won't be for everyone, but it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> series' flagship software features and is certainly worth a try. Whether you're using it once or every time, this guide will teach you how to use Camera Coach.</p><h2 id="what-is-camera-coach-2">What is Camera Coach?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T8qNdg3XS2SSrdP2ifBJXX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Camera-Coach-1" alt="Camera Coach on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T8qNdg3XS2SSrdP2ifBJXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Up until now, Google's robust suite of generative AI photo editing features has handled modifying pictures <em>after</em> they've been captured. These include tools like Magic Editor, but these AI features are stuck working with the same source material. By comparison, Google's new Camera Coach feature for the Pixel 10 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> utilizes AI to provide instructions <em>before</em> the photo is captured.</p><p>Camera Coach is currently in preview, and the way it works is simple. When enabled, Google uses custom <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> models to scan what's in your viewfinder and provide tips to produce a better shot. These suggestions might include creative setup options or corrections for potential framing or lighting problems. These tips are specific to your situation, so it's sort of like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/camera-coach-is-the-best-google-pixel-10-ai-feature">having a photography teacher in your back pocket</a>.</p><p>It's worth noting that AI does scan your viewfinder, and the data does leave your device. Google explains that "when you use Camera Coach, the contents of the scene will be sent to Google for processing and then deleted." Don't share anything private with Camera Coach for this reason.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-camera-coach-on-the-pixel-10-2">How to use Camera Coach on the Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dCBzuZt2iV29kzuCjxtM4i" name="google-pixel-10-blue-camera-coach-01" alt="Using Camera Coach on a blue Google Pixel 10 to take a picture of a potted plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCBzuZt2iV29kzuCjxtM4i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Activating the Camera Coach feature is easy, as it's found right above the viewfinder in the Pixel Camera app. Here's how to do it:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Pixel Camera app</strong> on your phone. For quick access, you can press the <strong>side button</strong> twice.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Camera Coach icon</strong>, which looks like a camera with an AI sparkle and lives in the top-right corner of the screen.</p><p>3. Camera Coach will scan what's in the viewfinder.

It takes a bit for your viewfinder's contents to leave your device, get processed, and come back. For quick shots, you'll want to use your own judgment so as not to miss the action.

Yet, here we are, with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold set to arrive in October, a couple of months after its non-foldable counterparts.</p><p>After the original Pixel Fold, Google surprised many and released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, introducing an all-new design that was both sleek, modern, and incredibly thin. With the major redesign out of the way, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> focuses more on the minutiae, making a few seemingly iterative tweaks.</p><p>With that in mind, you're likely wondering whether to buy the Pixel 10 Pro Fold or opt for something else. We're here to provide a bit more insight into the reasons why or why not you should upgrade to Google's latest foldable.</p><h2 id="why-you-should-buy-a-pixel-10-pro-fold-2">Why you should buy a Pixel 10 Pro Fold</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="T2V97MB3ThRXLxME7CiHPU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-app-pair-02" alt="Multitasking on the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold with the new save app pair feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2V97MB3ThRXLxME7CiHPU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's address the biggest reason why you should upgrade to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold out of the way: it's the only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> with an IP68 rating. Although many other foldables have an IP rating, many of them are capped at IP48, while others still don't offer any type of dust protection.</p><p>That's not to say that you should immediately take your foldable to the beach or toss it in a bucket of water. But considering that durability is one of the biggest sticking points for those considering foldables, the IP68 rating goes a long way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aKm92RNxRUykB5dqnkb7QU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-split-screen-01" alt="Multitasking on the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aKm92RNxRUykB5dqnkb7QU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond that, the next biggest reason to buy the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is all about performance. Google did an admirable job with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, despite benchmarks putting it far behind the competition. Even still, the 9 Pro Fold barely skipped a beat, even with all of the various Gemini additions that were introduced.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/im-surprised-that-im-this-excited-for-the-pixel-10-pro-fold">Tensor G5</a> in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn't quite match up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, Google says it provides more than a 30% boost to CPU performance over the G4. Perhaps more importantly, the G5 improves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> performance by approximately 60%, giving Gemini ample room to grow.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-jade-pixelsnap-ring-unfolded-01" alt="A Pixelsnap Ring attached to the back of the Jade Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And then there are several minor details that might be enough to help sway you to join the foldable lifestyle. This includes features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixelsnap</a>, which finally brings Qi2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users" target="_blank">MagSafe accessories</a> without requiring adapters or unique cases. Google also managed to incorporate a larger battery, claiming that the 10 Pro Fold can last up to 30 hours on a single charge.</p><p>Additionally, Google implemented these various improvements without increasing the price. The base model is still priced at $1,799 for 256GB of storage, and a 1TB option is now available if you want to turn the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-deals" target="_blank">10 Pro Fold</a> into a do-it-all phone.</p><h2 id="why-you-shouldn-t-buy-a-pixel-10-pro-fold-2">Why you shouldn't buy a Pixel 10 Pro Fold</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Mk2cfnRgShpCKVHFNpUbie" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold-display-inner" alt="Comparing the displays on the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mk2cfnRgShpCKVHFNpUbie.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's difficult to find too many flaws with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but there are a few frustrations and omissions. Most notable is the camera hardware, which doesn't use the same sensors as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, a phone that costs $800 less.</p><p>Google seems okay with leaving any improvements to the software, with on-device processing doing more of the heavy lifting compared to the non-foldable Pixel 10s. Of the three rear cameras, Google technically did upgrade the main wide-angle lens.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zMw4czny7P6bjcc6po833W" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-made-you-look-03" alt="Three new "Made You Look" animated camera features on the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zMw4czny7P6bjcc6po833W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, it's only using a newer 48MP sensor, while the telephoto and ultrawide cameras remain unchanged. I have no doubt that it'll still take fantastic pictures, but with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> now sharing the same primary camera sensor as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, Google's decision is disappointing.</p><p>Lastly, $1800 for a foldable phone is still a tough pill to swallow. Especially when viewed from the perspective of the general consumer.</p><p>You walk into a store and see the Galaxy Z Fold 7, with its all-new and sleek design, upgraded cameras, and packed with features that you'll never even realize are there. Then, you look the other direction and see the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which has a fresh coat of paint, but looks pretty similar to last year's model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LytDXXUSV3wFonhJRunbT6" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-03" alt="Comparing the size and thickness of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold (light blue), Honor Magic V5 (gold/copper), and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (dark blue)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LytDXXUSV3wFonhJRunbT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a $200 difference between the two, and in a vacuum, ignoring budget constraints, I'd have to guess that more people will reach for the Fold 7. Perhaps it would be different if Google even dropped the price by $100, narrowing its margins for a year, just to attract more people into the Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>Some understand the hidden costs that go into the creation of a smartphone. The rest either don't know or don't care and just see what looks like an iPhone-like release cycle with seemingly minimal upgrades.</p><h2 id="trying-to-decide-go-with-your-gut-2">Trying to decide? Go with your gut</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ibpVNdudxowt5GxwrSLA7V" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-all-colors-04" alt="The back of the Jade and Moonstone Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ibpVNdudxowt5GxwrSLA7V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that's throwing a wrench into the decision to buy the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is that it's not available yet and won't be until October 9. Google says this is due to "supply chain issues," and while it will still arrive ahead of the 2025 holiday frenzy, that doesn't help those who want to upgrade now.</p><p>You can already walk into basically any carrier store or Best Buy and walk out with a Fold 7. Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/"><em>just</em> announced</a> its next event, presumably where the iPhone 17 series will be introduced, and there's a good chance it'll be released before the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, too.</p><p>That's to say, if you had your heart set on picking up the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, I'd say just wait out the FOMO storm. At least on paper, the improvements look to be well worth it, and if you were on the fence, there's nothing wrong with testing the Fold 7 waters to see how you like it. There's always a return window in case you change your mind.</p><p>Personally, I'm waiting until the 10 Pro Fold is released before using my personal upgrade.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="dbfbce73-0b3f-4fd5-a934-27e0e5c7e70a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hQNR3RN8CceV62CE6dqS2e" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-Fold-render-Moonstone-tabletop" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hQNR3RN8CceV62CE6dqS2e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" data-dimension112="dbfbce73-0b3f-4fd5-a934-27e0e5c7e70a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,799</del><strong> $1,039 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>If the Pixel 10 Pro Fold shows anything, it's that Google is serious about the form factor, introducing just the right amount of upgrades over its predecessor to keep it in competition with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and other foldables. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="dbfbce73-0b3f-4fd5-a934-27e0e5c7e70a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-camera-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> is the clear winner and handily beats the other phones. I'd say the Pixel 10 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> were a tie; while the Pixel 10's photos are slightly brighter, I prefer the texture on the Pixel 9 Pro's photos.</p><p>The comparison between the Pixel 10 Pro and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is a little harder to judge. The Pixel 10's photos are brighter but softer than those of the OnePlus 13. The cat's fur appears clear in one shot on the OnePlus 13 and in the other shot on the Pixel 10 Pro. Maybe give the Pixel 10 Pro a very slight edge in this one.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra test surprised me a lot. Typically, Pixels trounce Samsung's phones in any motion test, but that wasn't the case here. If anything, the Pixel 10 Pro is only marginally better in some parts of the photo, like the cat's face and slightly brighter shadow detail.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="WmEaKBZJVHmcKVJawTCwTN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-oneplus-13-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-camera-samples-main-01" alt="Comparing photos of a billiard room between the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, and OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WmEaKBZJVHmcKVJawTCwTN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="gJu7qnzr9AXmNgLnZN6dSN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-samples-main-02" alt="Comparing photos of a shaded terrace with mountains in the background between the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and OnePlus 13 at 2x zoom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gJu7qnzr9AXmNgLnZN6dSN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="WftAgUedzRUzNNYzZVSPhN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-samples-main-03" alt="Comparing photos of colorful plants between the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and OnePlus 13 at 2x zoom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WftAgUedzRUzNNYzZVSPhN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="zgF7vFZwqMnYyKGw4V8zwN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-samples-main-01" alt="Comparing photos of a starkly lit greenhouse between the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zgF7vFZwqMnYyKGw4V8zwN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I also took the OnePlus 13, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Google Pixel 10 Pro XL out for a photo shoot in and around the Biltmore House.

The OnePlus 13 also does an exemplary job of this, while Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra tends to scrub away some of that fine detail, likely because Samsung's processing algorithm thinks it's camera noise.</p><h2 id="telephoto-and-ai-zoom-2">Telephoto and AI zoom</h2><p>One of the highlights of the Pixel 10 Pro series is the upgraded Pro Res Zoom, which finally competes with other premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">Android phones</a> by giving users the ability to zoom up to 100x with the camera.

If you've learned anything about AI over the past few years, that means that results are either mind-blowing or head-scratching.

detection of the pack, which Samsung has excelled at for years. The OnePlus 13 often takes second place, although there are a few areas where the edge detection could use improvement, especially when capturing images of non-human subjects (like plants).</p><p>Meanwhile, Google appears to have perfected the look of a camera portrait on plants and other similar non-human subjects, giving the photo a gorgeous shift in focus that seems to have come from a lens. Human subject cutouts are markedly improved, although there's still fringing happening around many of the brightest edges and a few spots where it could be further cleaned up.</p><p>However, the Pixel's exposure and color accuracy are significantly better than Samsung's, which often appears too dark and fails to prioritize exposure on the subject. I generally find that I prefer the OnePlus 13's shots for people and the Pixel 10 Pro's shots for other subjects.</p><h2 id="ultrawide-and-macro-2">Ultrawide and macro</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

It still takes excellent macro shots and generally excellent ultrawide photos, as well. The software intelligently switches between the two focus modes depending on the distance of the object in the photo.</p><p>In general, the OnePlus 13 has the best ultrawide performance of the bunch, with the nicest colors and the widest dynamic range, and roughly the same amount of detail as the Pixel 10 Pro. However, it doesn't score as well with macro shots. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is often the worst of the bunch, but the results are usually not bad.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro performs quite well in macro shots and appears to be the best among the three. That, combined with the solid-looking ultrawide shots, gives it the overall edge.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10"><span>Google Pixel 10</span></h2><p>My testing of the Pixel 10 was a bit more straightforward and with less Taylor Swift. I mainly focused on the Pixel 10 itself while also comparing shots with the Pixel 9, so we have an idea of how things have changed between generations.</p><p>The Pixel 10 may have the most upgraded camera system of the three phones, but it wouldn't seem that way on paper. That's because the resolution is downgraded on both the wide and ultrawide sensors from 50MP and 48MP to 48MP and 13MP, respectively. That said, photo quality hasn't degraded as a result; in fact, it might be a bit better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9</a>, thanks to the help of the new Tensor G5 and the addition of a third 10MP telephoto camera.</p><h2 id="main-camera-and-portrait-2">Main camera and portrait</h2><p>Images with the primary 48MP camera are often crisp and detailed, and there's seemingly more contrast this time around, which helps the photos pop a little more. It also does well with movement, able to capture large crowds of people without turning them into blurry messes, and can even seemingly freeze water in a fountain.</p><div class="inlinegallery

One of the areas Samsung is trying to streamline is its link for "effortless" check-ins. Now, the person responsible for taking care of you (son, daughter, etc.) can send you a text message with a link to Family Care.</p><p>After receiving, the mother/father/grandparent can accept and agree to Samsung's standard consent options for health data gathering and more. Once that's complete, everything is set. Samsung states this streamlined approach should make it easier for those unfamiliar with using apps, as the steps required are quite minimal and straightforward.</p><p>The newest update also allows "families to define caregiver and care recipient roles more clearly."

The alert will let the caregiver "respond immediately," via phone call or text.

The boldest example so far is Realme's new concept phone: it's surprisingly thin but holds an extremely huge battery.</p><p>At its recent 828 Fan Festival in China, Realme introduced two new concept smartphones.

Realme's somehow sidestepped that entirely. The company squeezed a monster battery into a chassis that's just 8.89mm thick, making the typical tough phone look ancient by comparison.</p><p>According to Realme, its battery holds more power than all five iPhone models from the 12 to the 16 combined. It's also pitching it as a portable charger you can use to power up your other devices, like your smartwatch or a friend's phone, with a cable.</p><h2 id="a-total-marathoner-2">A total marathoner</h2><p>So what does that get you? Realme estimates about five days of regular use, enough video playback to binge for two straight days, or it could just sit in your bag on airplane mode for a quarter of a year.</p><p>The major limitation is that the 15,000mAh battery isn't feasible to mass-produce yet, as per leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Q1vysv6vR" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station</a>.

According to the company's VP, this active cooling setup is powerful enough to cool the device by up to 6°C.</p><p>Realme threw everything at overheating with this concept. The cooling system is a three-part combo: a huge vapor chamber soaks up the heat, a tiny fan spins to dissipate it, and a thermoelectric cooler gives it that final chill push.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You can, however, create a custom voice for Bixby using your own voice, but it doesn't sound as good as the preloaded voices for Gemini.</p></article></section><h2 id="does-the-voice-assistant-on-the-galaxy-s25-sound-natural-compared-to-gemini-2">Does the voice assistant on the Galaxy S25 sound natural compared to Gemini?</h2><p>It became clear with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 series</a> that Samsung is putting more of its focus on Gemini and less on Bixby. As a result, Gemini was the default voice assistant on the Galaxy S25, which users could activate by pressing and holding the power button. It's not surprising that Samsung has put Bixby on the back burner.</p><p>One of the reasons why Bixby continues to feel behind is that the voice assistant constantly reminds you that you're talking to AI. That's because it doesn't sound as natural as Google Assistant or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>. While you can choose between several voices, they all sound robotic, and conversations don't flow as naturally.</p><p>On the other hand, Gemini also has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-change-geminis-voice-on-android">multiple voices to choose from</a>, and they all sound very realistic, as if you're talking to an actual person. This makes it easier to have naturally flowing conversations without feeling like you're talking to a computer. This is one of the perks of features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>, which lets you have free-flowing conversations where you can interrupt the assistant in the middle of an answer, something I can't do with Bixby.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KcR7JnGvLMXQrMQfZThmBk" name="Gemini-Live-S25-Pixel-9" alt="Gemini Live on the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcR7JnGvLMXQrMQfZThmBk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that Bixby has that Gemini doesn't is the ability to use your own voice as an option for the assistant, which you set up by reading a number of prompts to it. This allows it to capture your vocal intricacies and inflections. It works decently well, but it still sounds tinny and robotic.</p><p>Still, I prefer using Gemini over Bixby, and the voice is one of the reasons why Google's virtual assistant is generally better.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Where would Google's updates be without Gemini's intelligence, which is reportedly bringing summarization capabilities to the two apps.</p><p>The post highlights Gemini's ability to summarize files attached to texts in Chat, like PDFs, Microsoft Office files, text files, and more. Soon, you should notice a "summarize this file" button beneath content sent by others in Chat.

Honor has introduced a new solution to this common problem with its latest flagship phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Magic V5</a>.</p><p>Honor's new technology brings real-time, on-device translation to your device. What makes it different? Everything happens on the phone, eliminating the need for cloud solutions. That means better privacy, lower latency, and no internet dependency.</p><p>Two technical papers backing the tech were also accepted at INTERSPEECH 2025, a major conference on speech processing.</p><p>While some on-device translation has existed before, it often falls short in terms of speed, accuracy, and memory usage. Honor’s latest approach changes that, delivering cloud-level performance while keeping everything private and stored locally on your phone.</p><h2 id="tiny-memory-footprint-2">Tiny memory footprint</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2648px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:117.82%;"><img id="7vfLUvNVgUeG6X4DeEd3UX" name="Honor-Magic-V5-on-device-translation" alt="on-device translation on the Honor Magic V5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7vfLUvNVgUeG6X4DeEd3UX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2648" height="3120" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This leap forward comes from cracking tough problems in on-device multilingual speech recognition and translation.</p><p>One of the biggest hurdles for on-device AI is memory use. Typical translation models can eat up 3–4GB of space. Honor says its solution slims that down to just 800MB, or a 75% reduction, while still packing support for six languages: Chinese, English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian.</p><p>That also means you aren’t downloading half a gigabyte per language.</p><h2 id="real-time-translations-that-actually-feel-real-time-2">Real-time translations that actually feel real-time</h2><p>But the real improvement is in how it works. Instead of waiting for you to finish a sentence before translating (the classic way), Honor's system processes speech in real time, almost like a simultaneous interpreter. The company claims this approach boosts inference speed by 38% and improves accuracy by 16%.</p><p>Under the hood, the system uses something called Monotonic Finite Look-ahead Attention, a streaming method that helps the AI predict and transcribe speech without significant delays. There’s also a Parasitic Dual-Scale Modeling technique, developed with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, that helps run large speech models efficiently on phones without compromising performance.</p><p>It’s a quiet but meaningful step toward making AI more useful and less obtrusive, especially when you’re trying to have a natural conversation across languages.</p> ]]></dc:content>

My phone ended up hitting the concrete floor hard, and since I use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Moto Razr</a>, I thought for sure it was a goner. Luckily, everything is all good, and I have a developer setting called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/all-about-your-phones-developer-options">USB Debugging</a> to thank for it.</p><p>Although it's a foldable and they're not nearly as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-will-foldable-phones-ever-be-durable">durable as a regular phone</a>, the Razr was fine, or so I thought. The screen was on and I saw what I expected to see there, but touching it didn't do much; it was really squirrelly when swiping, and no icons would open an app. After restarting, it did nothing. I called Motorola's support, expecting to be told to send it to them for a repair estimate.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ynYtFdSEWMPa2J4Mv3UqAV" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-9" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in the Pantone Lightest Sky colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ynYtFdSEWMPa2J4Mv3UqAV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Long story short: I got on the line with one of those jewels of a representative who was certain he knew what was wrong and how we could fix it. I'm not sure how or why, but if the accelerometer and/or gyroscope aren't functioning properly, the display also isn't. Something to do with the way it switches when you close the phone. It's an easy fix, just enter a menu through the dialer and "reset" them.</p><p>Except I couldn't use the screen. How in the world could I get the dialer open if tapping the phone icon did nothing? With a cable and a command, that's how:</p><p><em><strong>adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.DIAL -d tel:*#*#2486#*#*</strong></em></p><p>From there, Lupe, the tech wizard, walked me through and got everything working.

It involves a driver of some flavor on the computer, and you need to enable developer tools on your phone and set it up. There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options" target="_blank">are good directions out there</a> if you are interested in the exact process.</p><p>Developers need this so their test phone can communicate with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-in-android-studio-debut">Android Studio</a>, but there are a lot of other things you can do by opening the command window or terminal on your computer and sending commands to the phone.</p><p>Google and phone makers suggest you do not enable this unless you need it, and to never leave it enabled. Why? Because if you set it up, it opens another way for people with bad intentions to do bad things.</p><h2 id="there-is-some-risk-2">There is some risk</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9gUxVk37mPwx6NokKUgrpm" name="OSOM-privacy-USB-cable.jpg" alt="OSOM Privacy Cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gUxVk37mPwx6NokKUgrpm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Done properly, enabling USB debugging is pretty secure. You can only communicate with devices you've authorized, either permanently or on a one-time basis. You need to do this for <strong>every</strong> computer you plan to communicate with. Until you give that authorization, nothing can be sent or received.</p><p>That's how things are <em>supposed</em> to work, but we all know software comes with plenty of bugs and built-in exploits. Let's say one of these is made public. What are the real risks?</p><p><strong>Everything</strong>. You're risking every piece of data on your phone or account, just like you would if you installed some sort of malware. If I can open the phone dialer because my computer is connected to my phone, I can also open things like email to reset a password, a bank app, or any other app.</p><p>Once your phone is in someone else's hands, all bets are off anyway, but this also means that every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/why-its-important-to-charge-your-phone-the-right-way-when-youre-on-the-road" target="_blank">USB charging port at the airport or bus station is now off-limits</a>, too. I have seen an airport charging kiosk being torn apart in Oakland because someone popped a Raspberry Pi-like mini computer inside it that would attempt to pull data from your phone when you plugged it in.

However, my limited testing with the Hozo NeoRuler showed that Vivo's X Fold 5 is 1mm thinner, and the Z Fold 7 is 2mm thinner than the Magic V5. Honor's caveat is that the claim was made when the Magic V5 debuted in China in July, and given that the Z Fold 7 didn't launch until later in the month, it's continuing to use the claim in its marketing materials.</p><p>Regardless of the dubious proclamations around thinness, what's evident is that the Magic V5 is just as sleek as its immediate rivals.

I tend to prefer Vivo's image tuning, so the X Fold 5 still has an edge, but that's just a matter of preference — there's no doubt that the Magic V5 comes mighty close. The foldable takes wonderful photos in daylight scenarios, producing shots with good dynamic range and white balance. Colors aren't overly saturated, and it retains detail.</p><p>It does just as well in challenging situations, and even in conditions with little to no artificial lighting, the Magic V5 took detailed photos. The tele lens is fabulous in its own right, delivering usable shots at up to 10x, and leveraging AI to eke out clean photos beyond that. The wide-angle lens is also good, just not as noteworthy as the other two cameras.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v5-software"><span>Honor Magic V5: Software</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cJYAwAHNQeLVzR4mSRXa45" name="Honor Magic V5" alt="Honor Magic V5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJYAwAHNQeLVzR4mSRXa45.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The Magic V5 still runs Android 15 out of the box, with no word on when Android 16 will be available. </strong></li><li><strong>There are useful AI features and extensive utilities, but the UI is in need of an overhaul. </strong></li></ul><p>While Google and Samsung's latest phones have Android 16 pre-installed, that isn't the case on the Magic V5. The foldable comes with MagicOS 9.0.1 based on Android 15 instead, and that's annoying for many reasons. There's no telling when Android 16 will be rolled out to the phone, and it will count toward one of the seven guaranteed updates.</p><p>Then there's the interface itself. While Honor modernized the UI to an extent last year, MagicOS still has remnants of older builds, and these holdovers from nearly a decade ago make it look less cohesive than other Android skins.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vUewhvbaadDPMWXodDdQu4" name="Honor Magic V5" alt="Honor Magic V5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vUewhvbaadDPMWXodDdQu4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Don't get me wrong; there's plenty of useful utilities and AI-assisted features available in the software, but the interface as a whole doesn't feel quite as modern or polished as its rivals. I'm not even comparing it to Google's efforts; Vivo, OnePlus, and OPPO's software is much better to use than what Honor is offering on the Magic V5.</p><p>Multitasking features are decent too; it's easy to launch split-screen mode, and you get a taskbar at the bottom. That said, there's no way to pin the taskbar — unlike other foldables — and Honor really needs to add a toggle to enable this.</p><p>What Honor does well is on-device AI; it has several tools aimed at image and video editing, real-time call translation, audio-to-text transcribing, and others that are highly useful. Honor collaborates heavily with Google in this area, and the results are much better than what you get on other Chinese phones — if anything, only the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a better AI suite.</p><p>The Magic V5 will get seven years of Android OS updates and security patches, just like Google's Pixel series and Samsung's Galaxy Z devices. This is great to see, and even though one update is wasted on bringing the device to Android 16 — what it should have launched with — but it will be relevant well into 2030.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v5-the-competition"><span>Honor Magic V5: The competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="xfZ9SCzgHpd553j2sYaWt4" name="Honor Magic V5" alt="Honor Magic V5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xfZ9SCzgHpd553j2sYaWt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5149" height="2900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo's X Fold 5 continues to be one of my favorite foldables of 2025, and although it doesn't differ too much to its predecessor, it combines a set of great cameras with useful software features and the best battery life of any device in this category. The hardware is a bit of a limitation as you don't get the latest silicon, but I didn't see any problems whatsoever. While it isn't available outside Asia, it's a good alternative to Samsung if you're in the region.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is also a decent choice if you're used to Samsung's software. The foldable has a thinner design, but the cameras aren't as good as the Magic V5, and the battery doesn't last anywhere as long.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v5-should-you-buy-it"><span>Honor Magic V5: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CwD3D3ApkkF8kec4p5JYu4" name="Honor Magic V5" alt="Honor Magic V5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CwD3D3ApkkF8kec4p5JYu4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You want a stylish foldable</li><li>You need useful AI features</li><li>You want powerful internals</li><li>You need a foldable with amazing battery life</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need the best software</li><li>You need Android 16 out of the box</li></ul><p>Having used the Magic V5 alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Vivo X Fold 5, it's clear that Honor nailed the brief this year. The Magic V5 holds its own against its immediate rivals, and it is just as sleek to hold and use. The absurdly-sized camera module tends to be a little annoying, but it's worth the inconvenience when you see just how good the cameras are on the device.</p><p>Honor has a definite edge over Samsung in key areas: the cameras are undoubtedly better than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and the Magic V5 has much better battery life, and the OLED panels are brighter and have meaningful eye protection features.</p><p>The downside is that the MagicOS software still isn't quite as good as what you get on Samsung and Vivo foldables, and Honor really needs to overhaul the visuals and modernize the UI. That's not to say that the software is unusable; you get plenty of decent AI features and extensive customizability,  it's just that the interface needs polish.</p><p>With other Chinese brands limiting their foldables to Asia, the Magic V5 is the sole contender to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in vital western markets, and the fact that Honor is once again willing to undercut Samsung makes the Magic V5 even more enticing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, just because two phones measure the same on paper, this does not mean that you can use phone cases designed for either model on the other device.</p><p>Smartphone manufacturers often make changes to the design of their phones, even if the size remains the same as the previous iteration. For example, the placement of the power button or volume button might change. In some instances, the speaker grills change positions. A change in the style and size of camera lenses or camera bars is also a common occurrence.</p><p>Sometimes, even when the stars seem to align, the slightest shifts in design can make a significant difference. This is the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8mm x 72mm x 8.6mm</p></td><td  ><p>152.8mm x 72mm x 8.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>204g</p></td><td  ><p>198g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see from the table above, the on-paper measurements of the two Pixels are almost exactly the same. Going off of just the specs, you would think that the Google Pixel 10 can fit Pixel 9 cases. However, this is not the case.</p><p>Google changed the size of the camera island with the Pixel 10, so the shape and length don't match the Pixel 9. The speaker, grills, mic, and USB-C port are also misaligned with the last-gen Pixel. Thus, even if you manage to fit a soft Pixel 9 case on your Pixel 10, you'll end up covering the speaker and getting a poor fit. Hard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Pixel 9 cases</a> won't fit the Pixel 10 at all.</p><p>Even if you manage to fit a flexible silicone or TPU case designed for the Pixel 9 on your Pixel 10, it isn't a good idea to do so.

The event will take place at 5 am ET and will clue users into what's coming next from its Galaxy portfolio. Those interested can watch from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/">Samsung Newsroom</a>, Samsung.com, or the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>While we may have an idea about what's to come, the company only teases that you'll see "new" Galaxy devices. However, Samsung states consumers can now reserve its latest Galaxy Tab, the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite, and receive a $50 credit offer for other purchases.</p><p>Keep in mind that this reservation opportunity lasts until September 3, and purchases with the credit must be made between September 4 and October 5.</p><h2 id="a-new-galaxy-is-coming-2">A new Galaxy is coming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="8rwfcrNsHJgs68ckMDk4xU" name="samsung-virtual-unpacked-event-septermber-2025" alt="A Samsung Virtual Unpacked teaser, preparing users for a September 4 event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8rwfcrNsHJgs68ckMDk4xU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="822" height="462" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So far, we've had official launches for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/the-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-pack-ai-smarts-and-strong-anc">Galaxy Buds 3 FE</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-lite-september-launch-confirmed">Galaxy Tab S10 Lite</a>.

A more recent report claims that a launch for the S25 FE could happen sooner than we think, perhaps in September, after this newly revealed event. More than that, we have the expected Galaxy Tab S11 series, which could also stand in the spotlight early next month.</p><p>There was a report after Samsung's July Unpacked from an executive that stated the Galaxy Tab S11 series would launch "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">shortly after</a>."

Beginning with the former, Google states Translate now offers a new "language practice" feature, which pushes the app to develop "tailored listening and speaking" practice sessions.</p><p>When using Translate, the post states users need only tap "practice" to get going. Initially, the app will ask you what you believe your current "level" is for any given language. Users will find options like Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Google says the practices Translate delivers will be generated "on-the-fly," but they will "adapt" to you the better you get.</p><p>Users will be asked about their goal for learning a language they're interested in before getting into the practice session. Google states practices will be in one of two ways: listening or speaking. If you're listening, you will have to tap the words you recognize from the AI-read statement. Speaking is pretty straightforward, as you'll have to say aloud what's in front of you—hints are there, too, just in case.</p><p>Google states this customized learning is rolling out in beta for the Translate app on Android and iOS this week.</p><h2 id="google-translate-meets-gemini-2">Google Translate meets Gemini</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xfhC9EmAJ8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The Translate app's real-time translations are being upgraded this patch, as Google credits its latest AI models for the improvement. Rolling out this week, users can tap "live translate," select the appropriate languages, and begin speaking. After you're done, the app will display what it's translated as it speaks it aloud for you.</p><p>Moreover, the AI models aid the Translate app in "intelligently" switching between the languages spoken by two parties (i.e., English and Spanish).</p><p>These enhanced live translate capabilities should begin appearing today (Aug 27) for users in the U.S., Mexico, and India. As it arrives, Google highlights its work to improve the quality and speed of the app's translations.</p><p>Gemini's intelligence continues to spread across Google's app ecosystem, but the AI model received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-leans-on-google-deepmind-transformative-image-edits-update">a major boost yesterday</a> (Aug 25) for photo editing. Using Google DeepMind's latest software as leverage, Gemini's built-in editor for photos takes off using your prompts. Google states its editor is designed to keep the people and subjects looking like themselves when changing their outfits, backgrounds, and when blending images.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication reports that while Project Hypernova is expected to sport a display on its lens, Meta is "setting low expectations for sales." The post by UploadVR quoted TF International Securities analyst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1960513106704277658">Ming-Chi Kuo on X</a>, who stated that the Hypernova glasses may enter mass production in Q3 2025.</p><p>Meta is supposedly projecting to sell anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 units over two years.</p><p>Both CNBC and Ming-Chi Kuo highlight Meta's concerns, which the former states revolve around Hypernova's requirement of "more components" and its "slightly heavier and thicker" build. The projections on X suggest that AI is the "selling point" of these new glasses; however, applying such software to an AR device "is still in its nascent stages."</p><p>The analyst presumes that Meta could treat these Hypernova glasses more like an experimental product once it hits the market than a true device to really hook consumers.</p><h2 id="still-looking-ahead-2">Still looking ahead?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Mid-August held <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-next-gen-smart-glasses-could-land-next-month-for-less-cash-than-youd-think">some interesting estimations</a> about how much Meta could charge for its Hypernova glasses. Projections pit the device at around $800, potentially signaling that Meta is looking to go "mainstream" and not just for those eyeing the high-end segment of the market. It was also alleged that Meta was originally thinking of pricing the glasses at $1,000 or higher, but taking into account Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro (and low consumer interest) probably encouraged the company to knock that price down.</p><p>That same report claimed that Meta could be gearing up for a September launch.</p><p>Interest in Project Hypernova has only increased after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-next-gen-ray-ban-hypernova-glasses-semg-bracelet-render-leaks">a few alleged renders leaked</a> via social media in July. While the glasses look similar in design to the Ray-Ban smart glasses, the images suggest a thicker build, which echoes what we're hearing in August. Those leaks also held a glimpse of what Meta's sEMG bracelet could look like.</p><p>This bracelet has been playtested by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich, who stated that the sEMG add-on is quite necessary for the glasses. In short, "Using a pair of smart glasses without this band is akin to using a smartphone without a touch screen."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Still, if you need a smartphone that's going to last over a day on a single charge, I might look elsewhere. The Z Fold 7 only has IP48 water/dust protection, which could be a problem if you like to take your phone into more rugged environments.</p><p>Indeed, the elephant in the room is that most foldable enthusiasts will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">choosing between the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, and the decision isn't easy. The Z Fold 7 has the lightweight design and powerful processor, but the Pixel 10 Pro Fold boasts IP68 protection and increased battery capacity.

It's a tough call, but if you're into foldable phones, you can't go wrong either way. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a04ed6d8-32eb-4076-9ad4-8e506cf59fbc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold 256GB: $1,799, plus free $350 gift card at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold 256GB: $1,799, plus free $350 gift card at Best Buy" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-Fold-render-Jade-tabletop" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" data-dimension112="a04ed6d8-32eb-4076-9ad4-8e506cf59fbc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold 256GB: $1,799, plus free $350 gift card at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold 256GB: $1,799, plus free $350 gift card at Best Buy" data-dimension25=""><strong>$1,799, plus free $350 gift card at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Although it doesn't officially hit store shelves until October 9th, it's already apparent that the Z Fold 7 has a serious rival in the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.

Both Derrek and I didn't have the feature for the first few days, and it looks like Tom Pritchard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review-a-great-phone-but-it-doesnt-feel-like-much-of-an-upgrade">from Toms Guide</a> had the same issue. But while our Magic Cue spun up quite nicely and was making suggested actions appear all over the place, Pritchard didn't have the same experience.</p><p>This makes us wonder what people are going to see on their retail units when they collect them tomorrow. Will Magic Cue start working as expected after the 24-hour processing window Google warns about when enabling it, or is this a feature Google will need to iron out for the next few weeks and months?</p><p>Magic Cue should be grabbing information from all kinds of sources and privately disseminating it in appropriate apps, something that certainly feels great when it works, but is frustrating when it doesn't appear, yet you expect it to!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AyVTFzWUFY5fwxCJLQbsp8" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-spigen-magsafe-ring" alt="The jade Google Pixel 10 Pro with a Spigen MagSafe ring attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyVTFzWUFY5fwxCJLQbsp8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 series might look basically identical to the Pixel 9, but there's something important hiding underneath: Pixelsnap. This new magnetic technology is a first for a major Android phone, packing in MagSafe-compatible magnets and Qi2 charging capability.</p><p>Tech Advisor's Alex Walker-Todd said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2887089/google-pixel-10-pro-review.html">in his review</a> that "Pixelsnap might quietly be one of the Pixel 10 Pro’s most meaningful hardware upgrades." I couldn't agree more, and it's about time a major Android manufacturer got on board with magnets inside of a phone. I'm a person who doesn't enjoy using cases and usually kept a case in my car just so I could use the magnetic phone mount I've got on my dash. Now I don't need that!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-11" alt="A white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL on a latticework black chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I've enjoyed my time with the Pixel 10 Pro series and will continue to use it for the next few weeks, I'm looking forward to going back to my OnePlus 13 when all is said and done. But not TechRadar's Philip Berne, who said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-10-pro-xl-review">in his review</a> that the "Pixel 10 Pro XL will be my primary device this year, for sure."</p><p>Berne says the primary reason for this is that the "Pixel 10 Pro XL is polished and well-built, with a refined look and gorgeous materials and color combinations." I agree that it's well-built, but I think Google could do a lot more to make the phone look more unique than an iPhone with a camera bar on the back — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-google-pixel-10-is-eerily-similar-to-the-iphone-and-thats-the-point">which is what it looks like right now</a>, let's not kid ourselves.</p><p>Regardless, Berne thinks "it’s a much nicer-looking phone than the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max, and it delivers on a number of features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> hasn’t been able to match." That second part is mostly indisputable, as Apple Intelligence was a cluster of a rollout for Apple and Google nailed most of the new AI-based features in the Pixel 10 series out of the box.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wVCNRdJmRYDqgJXAXxVp5G" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-moonstone-pixelsnap-ring-04" alt="A Google Pixelsnap ring attached to the back of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL via Qi2 magnets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVCNRdJmRYDqgJXAXxVp5G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the only downsides to Google adding Pixelsnap magnets inside the Pixel 10 series is that reverse wireless charging had to be sacrificed. This option was also known as Battery Share and could wirelessly charge devices like headphones or even <em>other phones</em> at a slow rate. It was an emergency power bank, in other words.</p><p>But as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-xl-review-redefining-the-smart-in-smartphone-170031073.html">Engadget's Sam Rutherford says</a>, "the Pixel 10 family no longer supports reverse wireless powersharing (aka Battery Share)." I can't say I miss the feature as I've never once used it in all my years of reviewing Android phones, but Rutherford laments the missing feature by noting that "every now and then I would find myself with a gadget that needed some juice, and even if it was slow, it was really nice to be able to bestow some excess energy upon a device without a cable."</p><p>Just goes to show you that even the "niche" features considered for the chopping block have their fans. As for me, I'm just glad <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a> lets me use magnetic accessories without a case on my phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2LtyEtsYHXBr23afguKxpB" name="google-pixel-10-pro-pixel-features" alt="All the new Google Pixel 10 Pro features in the Pixel Hub app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LtyEtsYHXBr23afguKxpB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the best reasons to choose a Pixel is for security and privacy. Privacy might sound a bit like an oxymoron when placed next to Google, but Pixels were built for privacy-first, and the Pixel 10 series furthers that goal with huge improvements to AI processing.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/766613/google-pixel-10-pro-review-ai-magic-cue-camera-pro-res-zoom">The Verge's Allison Johnson</a> mentioned this in her review as one of the highlights of the new phones. "Magic Cue, for example, runs in the background <em>on device</em>. A camera feature...runs a diffusion model <em>on device</em>. Same with the phone call translator that mimics the sound of your voice. It’s more than just an impressive list; running these entirely on the phone means your data is much more private than if it had taken a trip to the cloud."</p><p>That's a huge deal in a world where most companies try to sell you big AI features but often asterisk them with "internet connectivity needed" for it to work. Pixel's approach not only ensures you never need a subscription to get the phone's best AI features, but that your data doesn't leave your phone to get them.

They've got other colors but I don't care about any of them when this color is around! If anyone remembers, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/remembering-google-pixel-1-five-years">original Google Pixel</a> shipped in this color, and Google told us the Indigo colorway for the Pixel 10 is a purposeful throwback to that phone.</p><p>Android Central Managing Editor Derrek Lee said in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10 review</a> that "the iconic camera bar and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-color-should-you-buy">vibrant Indigo color</a> help this phone stand out, and anyone even vaguely familiar with Pixel phones would recognize this as one." And thanks to Pixelsnap, you don't have to cover it up with a case just to get MagSafe compatibility or Qi2 wireless charging!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hAQ6J4uRNwQFrgzFoGtieS" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-gaming-genshin-impact" alt="Playing Genshin Impact on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hAQ6J4uRNwQFrgzFoGtieS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's well known that Tensor isn't a "powerhouse" processor that can compete with Qualcomm Snapdragon or MediaTek processors on most levels, but Google has never been shy about its ambitions. Tensor is all about AI processing, and that's one of the things that makes the Pixel 10 series special.</p><p>One of those magical things is Voice Translate, a new feature that builds upon previous text translation features.

Reading the feature's description reveals that it uses "generative AI" and cloud processing, which might sound scary for photography purists. However, taking a closer look at Camera Coach reveals it's more about empowering Pixel 10 users to take better photos than using AI to make its own edits.</p><p>After sharing your camera viewfinder with Camera Coach (which is optional, by the way), it uses custom Gemini models to give you photography tips specific to your situation. Camera Coach might recommend you adjust the framing or lighting of the shot to get a better result. It might even give you setup ideas based on the scene. This is all happening with off-device AI, but it's deleted when you're done.</p><p>I'm particularly excited about Camera Coach, not because it can be used as a crutch, but because it could serve as a launchpad for people who want to learn core photography skills and don't know where to start.

That should provide extra layers of security and privacy than cloud processing, which offloads your data to Google servers. Still, that might not be enough for some people, leading them to avoid enabling Magic Cue for privacy reasons.</p><p>Which camp do you fall in?

However, there are benefits to eSIM, like increased security in the event your phone is lost or stolen.</p><p>Our own Nicholas Sutrich, who reviewed the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, wrote "while eSIM may be fine for some people, I have no interest in switching away from a physical SIM card." Derrek Lee tested the base Pixel 10, and after an initial eSIM failure during the setup process, called the experience "streamlined."

Let's clear the air — while the Pixel 10's main sensor does have fewer megapixels than the Pixel 9's primary shooter, this change was made to fit a third telephoto camera on the back. Megapixels aren't everything when it comes to smartphone photography, so the shift from a 50MP to a 48MP main lens shouldn't concern you.</p><p>In fact, as we've already covered, the addition of a 5x zoom lens on the base-model Pixel 10 is actually an upgrade that brings the phone in line with competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S25.</p><p>When Google made a similar main camera shift on the Pixel 9a earlier this year, we found that the change actually resulted in better color accuracy and produced ideal results. The same seems to be true of the Pixel 10 with its new camera system, as our reviewer Derrek Lee calls the colors "pretty true to life." Additionally, the Pixel 10 series has the Tensor G5 chip with an all-new image-signal processor (ISP), further improving camera performance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2LoUHptPbpx8EsmAQRBc7a" name="Pixel-10-all-devices" alt="Pixel 10 series - all devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LoUHptPbpx8EsmAQRBc7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This year, there are more similarities between the three Google Pixel 10 models than ever. Notably, they're all powered by the Tensor G5 mobile platform and feature three rear cameras. To the untrained eye, it might be difficult to notice that there are just as many differences between the three models, and you won't want to pick the wrong one.</p><p>For starters, the base-model Pixel 10 only gets Wi-Fi 6E support, rather than Wi-Fi 7 on the Pro models and even the older Pixel 9. That might not be a problem today, but it could loom large a few years from now as people move to more advanced networking hardware. Additionally, the 128GB version of the Pixel 10 uses UFS 3.1 for storage as opposed to the newer UFS 4.0 on the 256GB variant.</p><p>To top it off, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the only model to get Qi2.2 support for 25W fast wireless charging support.

It's a feature that takes a few days to kick in, but when it does, it's worth the wait. Magic Cue is essentially a superpowered version of that nifty feature that gives you automatic replies to messages.</p><p>If someone mentions an event in a message, a new "chip" button will appear at the bottom of the screen that automatically adds it to your calendar. Emails related to phone calls will appear in the dialer, like doctor's appointment reminders or airline details. It even stealth powers some of the other new features, like Daily Hub.</p><p>Voice Translate real-time translates your voice into another language while on a call. It's a fairly convincing version of your voice, too, and while I've heard some people say the translation is a little bit funny, it's still an impressive upgrade over previous real-time text translation features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.57%;"><img id="dCJkN4sJksj7LFt7nY9miX" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-edit-with-ask-photos" alt="Removing sun flare glare from a picture using Edit with Ask Photos on a Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCJkN4sJksj7LFt7nY9miX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1945" height="1392" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can now ask Gemini to edit a photo in Google Photos, including commands like removing glare, making it less blurry, enhancing a pet portrait, and more.

It's clear that Google wants you to think as little as possible about the intricacies of taking a good picture.</p><p>This also extends to the editing experience. Thanks to Gemini in Google Photos, you can now skip manual editing and let Gemini do it for you. And while it can't do everything, it can perform tasks such as removing certain elements, leveling the image, or enhancing colors.</p><p>It works surprisingly well using natural language, but I can't help but feel like it's teetering on a line of how much AI should be doing for us, especially when manipulating photos.
