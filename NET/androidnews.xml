                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3">Manifest v3</a> rules for Chrome Extensions seem to have everyone up in arms because the popular ad-blocker extension Ublock Origin was pushed out. Of course, social media and discussion groups are full of comments stating this was the purpose of the changes, and since Google is an ad company of course they want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-three-strikes-policy-for-ad-blockers">ban all ad blockers</a>. neither is true.</p><p>It's also not true that Ublock Origin doesn't work; I'm using it right now even though I was told it doesn't function. What is true is that Chrome extensions have some new rules to follow, which Google says are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/06/improving-security-and-privacy-for.html">designed to increase security and privacy. </a>Nobody believes them.</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, Manifest v3 is a response to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dataspii.com/">DataSpii</a>. DataSpii was described as a catastrophic data leak from Chrome and Firefox users who had certain extensions installed that were able to stay within the old set of rules but harvest user data ranging from Tax Returns to credit information. It was pretty bad.</p><p>Changes like preventing remote code from downloading or running and changes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/webRequest">WebRequest API</a> make it much more difficult for this to ever happen again. It will happen again but not for the same reasons or in the same way. Again, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security">not everyone agrees</a> that these changes are helpful.</p>

<p>Unless you write Chrome extensions, none of this matters to you. Your concern is that extensions you've come to depend on may stop working. That hasn't happened yet, but it might.</p><p>I mentioned that I'm still using Ublock Origin without any issues; I simply had to turn it back on in Chrome's settings. Because this goes against Google's perceived best security practices, I won't tell you how to do that, but you can easily Google the answer and do the same. I think this is one of those times where if you didn't know how to manage extensions yourself, you're better off using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en">Ublock Lite</a> anyway. That's not me being elitist (flipping a toggle on a settings page is hardly elite behavior), but I think some people are better off not messing with things. You know people like this if you aren't one of them yourself, and there is no shame in it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.93%;"><img id="S7hegeBbXDGL6rmLzBtsAV" name="ublock" alt="Extension management" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S7hegeBbXDGL6rmLzBtsAV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="410" height="217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the changes that prompted all of this — they were necessary... at least some of them. It's hard to believe that Google was OK with any extension running outside code that was never reviewed as long as it did, but it happened. I wanted to understand how extensions worked a while ago, so I wrote a couple of very complicated ones to display Photospheres stored in Google Photos and depended on the fact that I could host scripts that ran remotely. I don't have the same experience as someone who builds extensions regularly, but I know enough to understand why some of these changes are a good idea.</p><p>Will this kill off the next great idea? Maybe. I can't see the future, but if an idea comes along that would break the rules, someone could still write it for Firefox or Microsoft Edge. If Google continues to allow older extensions to run, users could install the unpackaged version in Chrome using developer mode. I wouldn't let this stop me from developing something I wanted to share with the world, even if very few people would ever be able to use it.</p><p>Ad blockers are a must. I know I work for a company that loves to place ads everywhere, but I would advise you never to browse the web without the protection of an ad blocker and a tracking cookie blocker because not only is the experience bad, but it can also point you towards malware. Don't do it. Use Ublock Lite and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Privacy Badger</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ghostery-tracker-ad-block/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij?hl=en" target="_blank">Ghostery,</a> and you'll be glad you did. Install them, use the default settings, and turn them on if nothing else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fFm38nhC7it8P3mYHaHFZN" name="Pi-4-logo.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fFm38nhC7it8P3mYHaHFZN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you want to go a step further, use a fast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nordvpn.com/features/threat-protection/ad-blocker/">VPN that blocks ads</a> or build your own hardware-based device like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-block-all-ads-pi-hole-raspberry-pi">Pi-Hole</a>. Or heck, do all three if you want. Just don't surf the web without some sort of insulation against the ads. You could even switch browsers and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-mozilla-firefox-update-so-important-even-department-homeland-security-says-you-should-upgrade">use Firefox</a> because almost every website supports its engine with no issues.</p>
<p>What not to do is pay attention to things that tell you the sky is falling. It's not. This is a case where another tech company is doing something that hurts developers or forces them to do extra work. We see that every day and should be glad that developers are willing to do that work and continue to provide the tools we need.</p><p>Focus that energy and outrage on the fact that it's 2024, and Chrome for Android <em>still </em>doesn't support extensions, which is far worse.</p>

<p>Read more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-gets-a-launch-date">here</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> has only been out for a couple of months, but Samsung is reportedly preparing for a newer version that may launch very soon, and this one might be a true competitor to some of the best foldable phones that have come out this year.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Special Edition" has been rumored for some time as a phone that would come with a slimmer body, larger displays, and improved cameras. Now, we're hearing that the launch could be just around the corner. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/looks-like-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-might-just-be-around-the-corner">According to a report</a> from FNNews, Samsung was expected to launch the phone on October 25, which is in less than a week. However, Samsung itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%EC%B4%88%EB%8C%80%EC%9E%A5-10%EC%9B%94-21%EC%9D%BC-%EC%83%88%EB%A1%9C%EC%9A%B4-%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C%EA%B0%80-%EA%B3%B5%EA%B0%9C%EB%90%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4">posted a teaser</a> for a "new Galaxy," which is set to be revealed on October 21, which is in just a couple of days.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition is rumored to measure just 4.9mm thick when unfolded and 10.6mm when folded, which is slimmer than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 but still thicker than other foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Honor Magic V3</a>. It has also been rumored to sport a 200MP primary camera.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola is finally rolling out Circle to Search on some of its phones months after the feature was a Samsung and Pixel exclusive.</p><p>Google's powerful AI assistant, which first launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series in January, quickly made its way to Pixel phones and other Galaxy models. Earlier this year, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/circle-to-search-coming-to-more-android-phones-in-october">teased that the feature would soon roll out to more Android devices</a> by October 2024.</p><p>In September, Xiaomi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/googles-circle-to-search-might-soon-break-out-of-its-pixel-and-galaxy-bubble">made waves by launching its first devices</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature. Not long after, Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-steps-up-to-challenge-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-with-this-ai-feature">revealed plans to bring the feature to its Magic V3 foldable and Honor 200 series</a>. Now, Motorola is jumping on board too.</p><p>While Motorola’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-is-redefining-the-mobile-experience-with-new-experiences-powered-by-google/" target="_blank">press release</a> confirmed that Circle to Search is coming to select <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Moto devices</a>, it left out one key detail—exactly which models will get the feature.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Motorola to confirm which devices will support the AI feature, and we’ll update the article as soon as we get a response.</p><p>Since other brands have been selective with Circle to Search, it’s probably safe to say that only a handful of Motorola models will get it. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr</a> foldables look like strong contenders, but we might see some inconsistencies in how this feature rolls out across Motorola’s lineup.</p>

After identifying the object, it instantly pulls up relevant search results.</p><p>Along with Circle to Search, Motorola announced that select devices will also support Rich Communication Services (RCS), Gemini Live, and the new AI features from Google Photos.</p><p>This rollout comes shortly after Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">introduced a new proof-of-concept that merges Large Action Models (LAM) with Moto AI's capabilities</a>, allowing your phone to understand your surroundings and tackle complex tasks just by having a natural conversation with it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>You've come to the right place if you need to know how to set the IPD on Meta Quest 3S. Setting the correct inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is one of the key pillars of having a good VR experience. When your IPD is set incorrectly, it can cause nausea, headaches, and dizziness. It can also make it difficult to slice blocks accurately in Beat Saber because your brain can't deduce the proper distance between objects.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>'s IPD adjustment method is quite different from other VR headsets on the market, so we've put together this guide to help you find your ideal IPD preset as well as some hidden tricks to enable additional IPD settings. If you have a Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as the Oculus Quest 2), these steps will also work for that headset.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-measure-your-ipd-2">How to measure your IPD</h2>
<p>In order to measure your IPD, you'll need two things: a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Westcott-Non-Shatter-Ruler-Inches-13862/dp/B00309RVJ6/">ruler with millimeter markings</a>, and a mirror. Any ruler will work so long as it has millimeter markings, but you will want a hard ruler instead of a flimsy tape measure to ensure accuracy.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>While looking in the mirror, <strong>close your left eye</strong>.</li><li>Look straight into the mirror at your right eye <strong>with your right eye</strong>.</li><li>Hold the ruler just below your eye and center the <strong>zero marker</strong> on your right pupil.</li><li><strong>Close your right eye</strong> and <strong>open your left eye</strong>, making sure to not move the ruler.</li><li>Look into the mirror at your left eye <strong>with your left eye</strong>.</li><li>Look straight and <strong>note the millimeter distance</strong> that matches up to the center of your left pupil.</li></ol>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ycnsgzER8Le3Q8T4xprv2H" name="measure-ipd.jpg" alt="How to measure your IPD by using a ruler" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycnsgzER8Le3Q8T4xprv2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, my IPD is 66mm. The average IPD sits around 63mm, but can range between 55mm and 72mm (or higher) depending on the person.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-adjust-the-ipd-on-meta-quest-3s-2">How to adjust the IPD on Meta Quest 3S</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M9yDchVsbRfkFHcNUpXpMB" name="Meta-Quest-3S-lenses-close" alt="Looking at the lenses inside a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M9yDchVsbRfkFHcNUpXpMB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that you have your IPD measured, you can accurately set the IPD on your Meta Quest 3S. You'll do this by physically sliding the lenses closer or further apart from one another. The Meta Quest 3S features three presets for IPD adjustment: preset 1 is 58mm, preset 2 is 63mm, and preset 3 is 68mm. By default, the Meta Quest 3S ships at IPD preset 2, which covers the average IPD.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Determine which preset works best for you using the measurements you wrote down earlier.</li><li>The closest preset is <strong>58mm.</strong> The middle preset is <strong>63mm.</strong> The furthest apart preset is <strong>68mm</strong>.</li><li>While holding the Meta Quest 3S, <strong>grab ahold of the gray cover </strong>on the outside of one lens.</li><li>Gently push the lens in toward the other to <strong>lower IPD</strong>, or push them apart to <strong>raise IPD</strong>.</li></ol>

<h2 id="what-if-my-ipd-doesn-t-match-the-presets-on-meta-quest-3s-2">What if my IPD doesn't match the presets on Meta Quest 3S?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B5TbKFZYw8FCZsRWoQQGNB" name="Meta-Quest-3S-lenses-angle" alt="Looking at the lenses inside a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5TbKFZYw8FCZsRWoQQGNB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If your IPD isn't exactly 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm, don't worry. Meta has designed the lenses on the Meta Quest 3S to help fit a range of IPD, but while one of those presets will fit nicely for most people, some folks will find they need a setting in between.</p><p>The trick is to gently move the lenses between presets and stop somewhere between the preset point.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>While holding the Meta Quest 3S, <strong>grab ahold of the gray plastic</strong> on the outside of one lens.</li><li>Gently push the lens in toward the other to <strong>lower IPD</strong> or push them apart to <strong>raise IPD</strong>.</li><li>Try to <strong>push just past</strong> preset 1 or preset 2 to get a more accurate IPD.</li><li>If you're having trouble pushing past, try pushing the lenses inward <strong>from a higher IPD preset</strong> instead.</li></ol>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S still only supports a maximum IPD range of 58-68mm, but using the spaces between presets can help folks who have IPD between the numbers. For instance, someone with an IPD of 60 or 61 might try the space between preset 1 and preset 2. Someone like me who has an IPD of 66 can try the space between preset 2 and preset 3 for a more comfortable experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Whispers about Samsung&apos;s next A-series budget phone entry surface with a change that&apos;ll give you flashbacks.</p><p>In conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1847222100697698340">X tipster OnLeaks</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-full-design-out-via-5k-renders-360-video/">Giznext</a> posted some alleged information regarding the upcoming Galaxy A36 5G. The device&apos;s leaked renderings show it could continue to feature smooth, flat sides with rounded corners and a "relatively thin" body. However, the most significant change concerns its rear panel. According to the rumors, the Galaxy A36 5G could see the return of an old-school camera array.</p><p>The renderings show the device could sport a triple vertical camera array inside a raised, bordered housing. It seemed familiar to us <em>and </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/hendrawaskitha/status/1847226423960060147">users on X</a>, who stated the design is reminiscent of the 2019 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review">Galaxy Note 10</a>.</p><p>While the images suggest three cameras, the details of the sensors are unknown.</p>

<p>The front of the device seems relatively similar to its soon-to-be predecessor. The publication claims the Galaxy A36 5G will feature a flat 6.6-inch, 120Hz fresh rate display with "thin bezels." However, while the display&apos;s chin isn&apos;t <em>too large</em>, it does catch your attention. A centered punch-hole selfie camera rounds out its relatively tame front appearance.</p><p>Other specifications are still speculative; however, the post states the A36 5G could feature an Adreno 610 GPU. Moreover, Samsung could power the phone with the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a>. The latter debuted late in 2023, built on a 4nm process with the promise of "significant" camera performance boosts for midrange phones.</p><p>A potential launch date is still in the air — at least for overseas markets. The publication purports that a launch in India is "imminent," but fails to mention the U.S.</p><p>The rumored design of the Galaxy A36 5G sticks close to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-a35-just-landed-in-the-us-with-a-sweet-deal-on-the-galaxy-buds-fe">the A35 5G</a>. That device offers a 6.6-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with thin bezels and that same (slightly) noticeable chin. This phone also features 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage. The current rumors suggest a similar trend, at least RAM-wise for the A36 5G.</p><p>On the other hand, rumors about its potential launch echo what Samsung did with the A35. After its debut overseas, U.S. consumers had to wait for the device to launch. Samsung ended up dropping the product in the States a month later. With the A36 5G rumored to launch in India "soon," perhaps the Korean OEM will give U.S. folks a later pick-up date again.</p><p>The features of a device are always a talking point, but the recent rumors don&apos;t touch on that for the Galaxy A36 5G. However, it makes sense to expect some level of Galaxy AI, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">Samsung&apos;s newfound R&D focus on it</a>.</p>

You need to decide whether you want something made of glass or plastic. Both are protective, but glass is more durable while plastic is thinner and offers a higher touch response.

<p>Milomdoi is another one of our long-time favorites. The brand's 3-Pack Screen Protector for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE includes an alignment tool, a cleaning kit, three glass camera lens guards in black, and three durable tempered glass screen protectors. All that for a mere $8 makes this a steal.</p></p>

<p>Very few Galaxy S24 FE screen protectors come without a front camera cutout. The LK 3 Pack Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Screen Protector set is a little pricey, but cheaper than Spigen. It includes three notch-free 9H tempered glass screen protectors with military-grade drop-proofing. You also get a comprehensive alignment frame and directions to a video tutorial.</p></p>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-screen-protector-for-your-galaxy-s24-fe-2">How to choose the best screen protector for your Galaxy S24 FE</h2>
<p>There are plenty of different screen protectors available for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE. Most of them are made of tempered glass, which is an excellent shatter-proof material. The industry standard is 9H tempered glass, which is what you should seek out when buying screen guards. However, if you don&apos;t like the thickness that glass adds, you can always get a TPU or PET plastic film. TPU plastic is more durable than PET and can repair itself as long as the scratch is small.</p><p>With that being said, I always recommend tempered glass screen protectors over plastic films. In some cases, a plastic screen guard is actually a better choice. For example, the Pixel 6 had a finicky fingerprint sensor so I advised against glass screen protectors. Fortunately, the Galaxy S24 FE doesn&apos;t have this issue as far as I know.</p><p>The best screen protector for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE comes from amFilm, a brand that&apos;s famous for selling good quality screen guards at really great prices. The amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch for Samsung Galaxy S24 FE comes with everything you could ever need, from two camera lens protectors and two tempered glass screen guards to a cleaning and installation kit. It&apos;s priced below $10, making this the best overall choice without a doubt.</p><p>If you don&apos;t like the bulk of glass, IQShield offers a reliable alternative to consider. The IQShield Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Clear Film (2-Pack) includes a duo of durable TPU films. There&apos;s no lens protector in the box, but the film is really thin so it delivers a fantastic touch response and self-repairs small scratches and abrasions. This set will set you back $10 too, which is also filthy cheap albeit not as value-packed as the amFilm kit.</p><p>After getting a solid screen protector, be sure to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-cases-for-the-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe">best cases for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</a> as well. You don&apos;t want to damage the body of your $650 phone either. A good case keeps your phone fresh for years, increasing its resale or trade-in value.</p>

<p>More layoffs strike Meta employees late in 2024.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24272195/meta-layoffs-whatsapp-instagram-reality-labs">The Verge</a> was tipped off about the layoffs thanks to a post on Threads by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@wongmjane/post/DBMuvFvTw8H?xmt=AQGzhz1IKFrde8FeEKMQ8tNplRUM9yJ4dwSk_3fXs--4pQ">Jane Manchun Wong</a> and other former Meta employees. In their post, Wong states, "I’m still trying to process this but I’m informed that my role at Meta has been impacted." </p><p>The publication&apos;s report states the company has issued layoff notices to employees working on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs. Unfortunately, the exact number of impacted personnel at Meta is unknown.</p><p>Meta spokesperson Dave Arnold informed The Verge that the company is "making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy." Moreover, there&apos;s a chance that not everyone will be let go entirely.</p><p>Arnold adds the latest wave includes "moving some teams to different locations and moving some employees to different roles." Additionally, Meta is supposedly "working hard" to find "other opportunities" for those caught in the layoffs.</p><p>It seems Meta is still regressing to its 2021-era employment levels. In March 2023, the company hit its Comms team and project and policy managers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-may-2023-layoffs">from Reality Labs with a wave of layoffs</a>. It&apos;s worth noting that the company&apos;s Reality Labs Division was hit the hardest that time as former staff members took to LinkedIn to tell the news. That wave arrived just before Meta&apos;s major VR Gaming Showcase in 2023.</p><p>The blow to the Reality Labs team (again) is strange considering Meta has been pushing its VR hardware more as it recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-launch">entry-level Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><p>The layoff trend continues as you may remember Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-q4-2022-earnings">laid off roughly 11,000 employees</a> toward the end of Q4 2022. This was part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s &apos;Year of Efficiency" for the company. Zuckerberg added Meta is "focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization." The company turned around and let go of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-announces-more-layoffs-year-efficiency">additional ~10,000 employees</a> a month later in March 2023.</p>

<p>If you want an ad-free experience on YouTube, Google wants you to pay for YouTube Premium. There's only one tier, with individual plans costing $13.99 per month. You can get family or student plans, too, but people looking for a cheaper version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> have been left wanting more. Although Google tested a "YouTube Premium Lite" plan for two years, the pilot program was shut down in 2023.</p><p>Now, there's a chance YouTube Premium Lite could be making a comeback — albeit in a different form. Over the last few days, users in select countries have spotted a Premium Lite subscription tier in the YouTube app. One user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@jonahmanzano/post/DBLncDhzYk5" target="_blank">Jonah Manzano, on Threads</a>, shared a screenshot of the offering:</p>

<p>Later, a Google spokesperson confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-premium-lite-return-3491130/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> that the company was testing "a different version of Premium Lite." The company added that the test was region-limited, and users in "Australia, Germany and Thailand may see the option to sign up," per the report. For now, it's too early to tell whether the YouTube Premium Lite plan will stick around at all, let alone come to other regions.</p><p>Since the original Premium Lite experiment was limited to select countries in Europe, North American users haven't yet had the option to pay for a cheaper YouTube Premium subscription. The original pilot program gave subscribers an ad-free experience while cutting out some of the extras that were included with the full Premium subscription — like background video playback, video downloads, and YouTube Music Premium access. It was priced at roughly €6.99, or around $7.50 in U.S. dollars.</p><p>However, the Premium Lite that Google is testing today is far from the bargain the original pilot program was. In exchange for about half the price of a full Premium subscription, users who sign up for the new Premium Lite plan will get a "limited ad experience." It doesn't completely remove ads anymore, and all the extras are still missing.</p><p>That's despite the Premium Lite test costing around double the price of the original, which has drawn criticism from users on social media, such as under the Reddit thread below.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1d0d1sg/premium_lite_coming_back">Premium Lite coming back?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube">r/youtube</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>It's no secret that there are plenty of ads on YouTube. For users watching on a smart TV, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-longer-fewer-ad-breaks">fewer — but much longer — ad breaks</a>. That's why many YouTube watchers want a way to experience the platform ad-free, and they have fewer options now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-blocks-third-party-ad-blockers">Google is amidst an ad-blocker crackdown</a>.</p><p>YouTube seems to be following in the footsteps of other streaming services, like Netflix, which have ad-supported subscription tiers. However, YouTube is a free-to-access platform, so it's fundamentally different. It remains to be seen whether users are ready and willing to pay for a "limited ad experience" on YouTube with the Premium Lite test.</p>

<hr>
<p>The third quarter&apos;s smartphone sales analysis has arrived and a few OEMs record positive growth.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/global-smartphone-market-q3-2024">Counterpoint Research</a> reported the global sales report for the smartphone industry in Q3 2024 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/17/google-pixel-q3-2024-quarterly-sales-record/">9to5Google</a>). The publication states the "sell-through" for phones this past quarter grew 2% YoY (year-over-year). While this is reportedly the "fourth consecutive" quarter to see industry growth, the post adds LATAM, Western Europe, and Japan spearheaded sales.</p><p>Strong quarterly momentum struck "other brands" as research highlights Google as a notable company. Research Director Tarun Pathak commented, saying Google "recorded their highest-ever smartphone volumes in a quarter in Q3." Unfortunately, the director didn&apos;t provide a specific number behind this new record.</p><p>Motorola also hit a "highest-ever" record in phone volume this past quarter. Moreover, Moto and Huawei saw sales grow 30% YoY.</p><p>As usual, the report detailed the performance of the "Top 5" OEMs, beginning with Samsung&apos;s first-place spot in Q3. The company leads the quarter, making up 19% of the market share, followed by Apple with 16%. Chinese brand Xiaomi slides in at third place with 14%.</p><p>Google&apos;s been on an uphill trend lately <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-market-share-grows-in-us-despite-a-decline-in-phone-sales-overall">as a report from March</a> detailed its growth despite an overall smartphone decline in 2023. Sales figures showed the company&apos;s totals were approaching 5% in the U.S. by the end of last year. Additionally, Google was the only OEM that reported a growth in market share in the U.S. in 2023. The brand is still a way out from touching Samsung and Apple, but any growth is positive in the grand scheme.</p><p>More importantly, with Q3 running from July to September, it seems Google can thank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">its Pixel 9 series</a>. The series arrived with three slab phones: the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. These devices finally gave more meaning behind the once-thought buzzword: AI. With Gemini leading the charge, the Pixel 9 series offers several on-device AI tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and more powered by its Tensor G4 SoC.</p><p>We&apos;re now wondering how well Google can keep the train rolling. The Tensor G4 was a minimalistic upgrade over the G3; however, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">Tensor G5</a> is expected to be its first fully customized SoC out of TSMC&apos;s kitchen.</p>
