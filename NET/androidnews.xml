                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If you buy an Android tablet today, it shouldn't be one that costs more than about $500. That goes for Apple, too... most people shouldn't buy an iPad costing more than that, either. The bottom line is that for the bulk of users, a tablet is a middling device — it just can't replace your favorite Android phone or your computer. That said, there are downright excellent tablets priced at roughly $400 or $500, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>.</p><p>Even still, Samsung doubled down on the premium Android tablet sector with the Galaxy Tab S10 series last year. It didn't release a base-model Galaxy Tab S10, instead choosing to only release Plus and Ultra models. That means the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus lineup starts at $1,000, with the highest-end Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra configuration — with 1TB of storage and 16GB RAM — costing a staggering $1,620.</p><p>That begs the question: Is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10">Galaxy Tab S10 Plus or Ultra</a> worth double or triple the price of the Pixel Tablet or OnePlus Pad 2? Is it twice as good, or does it provide an experience that's 2x better? Currently, the answer is a flat-out no. But if professional-grade apps start becoming a real part of Android — like Adobe's planned mobile Photoshop suite — that answer can change very fast.</p>

<p>I spent weeks testing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> and Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus side-by-side, and both experiences were frustrating. Samsung seems to have the edge in multitasking, at least on paper, whereas Apple shines in app compatibility. Aside from Apple-owned apps Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, the iPad Pro also supports the iPadOS version of Photoshop — which gets close to matching the functionality of the desktop client.</p><p>It was hard for me to take the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus seriously as a $1,000 tablet when it runs the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-adobe-photoshop-on-your-phone-or-chromebook">Photoshop or Adobe Express apps</a> as a $100 Android device. The extra power might be there, but the software isn't taking advantage of it. That's why I'm particularly excited by the announcement that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/a-photoshop-app-for-android-is-coming-and-you-can-try-registering-for-the-beta-now">Adobe is bringing a true Photoshop app to Android</a>.</p><p>Make no mistake, this isn't an app on par with Photoshop's desktop version. With that being said, there is definitely reason to get excited about the upcoming Photoshop on Android app. It includes full support for PSD files and cloud syncing, as well as precise selection and editing tools, including removing, recoloring, and replacing objects. Firefly AI will be there too, with Generative Fill, Generative Expand, and Text to Image, plus the Spot Healing and Brush tools.</p>

<p>Android tablets like the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra will immediately become more competitive with the iPad Pro — and laptops in general — with a capable Photoshop client. Currently, all that's available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> of all specs and price points is the weak Photoshop Express app, which pales in comparison to the rest of Adobe's software and inherently limits the Galaxy Tab's capabilities.</p><p>While Adobe's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/02/25/all-new-photoshop-iphone-app-reimagines-image-editing-for-mobile-creators?clickref=1011lAjjkPTK&mv=affiliate&mv2=pz&as_camptype=&as_channel=affiliate&as_source=partnerize&as_campaign=futurepublishing" target="_blank">blog post</a> is light on details, I'm hopeful that the new mobile app and web client will help premium Android tablets offer a better value proposition. With the new Photoshop app structure for Apple products, the iPhone gets a capable photo editing app, and the iPad gets an even more capable version with extra features. In a perfect world, this arrangement can be mimicked by Android phones and high-end Android tablets in the future.</p><p>I've reached out to Adobe to confirm whether the upcoming Photoshop on Android app will have full support and optimization for various display sizes, including tablets and foldables. I'll update this article when I hear back.</p><p>The good news is that even if support is spotty, Android users will always have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-sideloading">sideloading</a> and a web client to fall back on. No matter how this goes, the experience of photo editing on a premium Android tablet should be significantly improved.</p>

<p>As of now, I can't be convinced that an Android tablet costing $1,000 or more is worth your money. Everyone has different needs and use cases, but fundamentally, there currently aren't any professional or desktop-grade apps that can take advantage of the hardware a Galaxy Tab S10 Plus or Ultra offers. Yes, a Galaxy Tab S10 series device is great for content consumption, drawing or note-taking, and plenty of other things — but so could a OnePlus Pad 2 or Pixel Tablet costing half the price.</p><p>The dream scenario here is that Adobe sets an example for other Android developers, showing what's possible on the platform. I'm not opposed to recommending expensive Android tablets, but they need to deliver experiences worthy of their price tag. Today, I'll take a sub-$1,000 touchscreen laptop over a Galaxy Tab S10 Plus every single time.</p><p>If the Photoshop on Android app lives up to my expectations, and other devs follow in Adobe's footsteps, I think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">high-end Android tablets</a> can actually find a value proposition that makes sense.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Qualcomm’s X85 5G modem is here, promising faster speeds, better battery life, and smarter AI features for everything from flagship Android phones to PCs and IoT devices.</li><li>Expect 12.5 Gbps downloads and 3.7 Gbps uploads, plus 400MHz bandwidth.</li><li>A built-in AI accelerator makes the X85 30% faster at AI tasks, improving signal strength, reducing lag, and saving battery life.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today at MWC 2025, Qualcomm unveiled the X85 5G modem, promising faster data speeds, improved energy efficiency, and advanced AI features for a broad range of devices, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">high-end Android smartphones</a> to PCs and IoT devices.</p><p>Qualcomm’s modems are what make 5G work in most smartphones and tablets today, and the new X85 is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x80-mwc-2024">big step up from its predecessors</a>. It brings some firsts to the table, like 400MHz bandwidth, along with peak download speeds of 12.5 Gbps and uploads hitting 3.7 Gbps.</p><p>At the core of the X85 is the Qualcomm 5G AI Processor, a built-in AI accelerator that’s part of the modem. It’s 30% faster at handling AI tasks than older versions, which means things run quicker, smarter, and with less drain on your battery, according to Qualcomm. This means you get better signal, less lag, and more efficient power use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HC4yQXJf426wSDbwE4rL3E" name="Qualcomm-X85-infographic" alt="Qualcomm X85 modem infographic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HC4yQXJf426wSDbwE4rL3E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With its AI-powered 5G Advanced features, the X85 also brings additional perks to the mix. Mobile gaming gets smoother, dual-SIM setups work smarter, and location tracking becomes more precise, as per Qualcomm.</p><p>The X85 also aims to fix some real annoyances. It is designed to keep your connection steady even in packed places and helps your battery go the extra mile. And it’s not just for phones. This modem is ready to work in all sorts of devices, from home internet setups and cars to big systems like railways.</p><p>The Qualcomm X85 5G is what’s powering Qualcomm’s new Dragonwing FWA Gen 4 Elite, the company's first 5G Advanced platform for fixed wireless internet.</p>

<p>Qualcomm has some big names in its corner for the X85, like China Telecom, Google, and Verizon.</p><p>And if the X85 seems a bit over the top for your needs, Qualcomm has also unveiled the X82 5G Modem-RF—a more down-to-earth option that still brings multi-gigabit speeds to a wider range of devices.</p><p>The X85 and X82 are already in the hands of manufacturers, so we should start seeing devices with these modems later this year.</p>

<p>Tracking OnePlus Watch 3 updates is a must. Why? The more updates the smartwatch gets, the more features and security fixes you can enjoy. However, not all smartwatches get equal support.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review" target="_blank">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, is only guaranteed to get two software updates. OnePlus also promised two years of bi-monthly updates through early 2027. The previous generation of the brand's wearables was promised three years of Wear OS support, so it's disappointing to know that the latest model gets one less software update.</p><p>OnePlus' limited update policy might be a dealbreaker, as the Watch 3 falls behind Google's model by one update and Samsung's model by two. The OnePlus Watch 3 currently has Wear OS 5 with its RTOS, which helps provide multi-day battery life. But is that enough to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-for-battery-life" target="_blank">best wearables</a>?</p><p>OnePlus has not confirmed the time frame for its two software updates. What we do know is that a new feature called 60-second Health Check-In with ECG will officially launch in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-watch-3-key-features-available-time">March 2025 OTA update</a>. The health feature uses seven key indicators: vascular health, ECG, sleep monitoring, heart rate, SpO2, and wrist temperature.</p><p>With an estimated launch date of April 15, the OnePlus Watch 3 is expected to receive updates until 2027. However, OnePlus does not pinpoint how quickly it will release software updates.</p><p>Why are Wear OS updates so important? The Wear OS 3 rollout blunder left various wearables without Google Assistant support for years, ultimately pushing Fossil out of the update competition.</p><p>Samsung and Google are top contenders in providing long-term software support for their wearables. Currently, OnePlus is two years behind both. In comparison to brands such as TicWatch and Xiaomi, who offer no guaranteed update cycle, OnePlus at least provides two years of updates. That's an improvement, but three years of software updates would be even better.</p>

<p>Foldable phones aren’t cheap. They’re among the most premium, most expensive phones you can buy. But if you’ll make use of all its features and want to flex to your friends that you have one, there are many good options to consider. Two are the OPPO Find N5 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Both are great foldables, but they differ in ways that could help you decide between them.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EvULaRM8DpQsMLbCE2LKo4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 multitasking" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvULaRM8DpQsMLbCE2LKo4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you loved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, you’ll be delighted with the OPPO Find N5, which serves as its successor. But before diving further into what makes this phone so great, it’s important to note the elephant in the room: it likely isn’t coming to North America. With that said, if you live elsewhere or can somehow get your hands on one, you’ll want to consider it.</p><p>Available in either black or a white pearlescent finish, it has a 6.62-inch outer screen that boasts 2,480 x 2,248-pixel resolution and an inner unfolded screen that’s a colossal 8.12 inches with 2,616 x 1,140-pixel resolution. The outer screen offers 2,100 nits peak brightness and 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate and the inner 2,450 nits peak brightness and the same adaptive refresh rate.</p><p>But what really makes this foldable stand out is that it’s the thinnest foldable you can find today, measuring a mere 8.93mm when folded and 4.21mm when unfolded. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">his review</a>, Harish Jonnalagadda says that because it’s so thin, you almost forget it’s not a regular, non-foldable phone.</p><p>When it comes to the screen, he loves the color vibrancy, which boasts Dolby Vision and HDR10+, describing it as “among the best of any foldable I’ve used.” There’s also eye comfort tone to help reduce eye strain, especially in dark settings, along with 2,160PMW comfortable dimming for low-light environments. There’s even a bedtime mode that can reduce blue light.</p><p>Encased in an Armor Shield housing, the OPPO Find N5 has a nanocrystal glass outer screen and UTG on the inner screen with dual layers of anti-impact films. It opens and closes using a 3D-printed titanium alloy Flexion hinge with a reduced crease that is virtually imperceptible when the phone is unfolded, says Jonnalagadda. Speaking of folding and unfolding, it can lock at any angle between 50° and 150°, which is super convenient.</p><p>While, like most foldables, this phone isn’t rated for protection against dust, it does sport impressive water-resistant ratings, including IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9, the latter of which is the highest you can get to ensure durability against not only water submersion, but even high-pressure jets.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 runs ColorOS, which is based on Android, and comes with only one storage option of 512GB. It has a massive 5,600mAh OPPO Silicon-carbon battery that affords all-day use. This can equate to up to 25 hours of continuous video streaming or 8.6 hours of Zoom meetings (though who wants to do that?).</p><p>In his tests, Jonnalagadda confirms that the OPPO Find N5 lasts longer than any other foldable phone he has tested to date, up to a full day even with heavy use. Thanks to ultra-fast 80W SUPERVOOC wired charging and incredibly speedy 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging (with compatible chargers), it’s back up and running in no time as well.</p><p>You’ll get five Android platform updates and six years of security updates, decent protection for your investment. Indeed, this phone doesn’t come cheap. Then again, no foldable does.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3FGYqBKJBN3vqWm7LtVoeC" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-6.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold in leaves" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3FGYqBKJBN3vqWm7LtVoeC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s consider how the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which was introduced in September 2024, compares. It comes in the usual Google finish flavors, Obsidian and Porcelain. The outer screen measures a slightly smaller 6.3 inches with a lesser 2,424 x 1,080 resolution and a 60-120Hz adaptive refresh rate. You’ll get up to 2,700 nits brightness, though.</p><p>The inner screen once unfolded is 8 inches, a smidge smaller, with a smaller 2,152 x 2,016 resolution, 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and up to 2,900 nits brightness. So, while the screens on this phone aren’t as high resolution (though likely via an imperceptible difference), they are ultra vibrant and bright, by comparison.</p><p>What’s worth noting is that while the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is not as thin nor as lightweight as the OPPO Find N5, it’s really only a few hairs (millimeters) thicker when both folded and unfolded, so it’s not a completely night and day experience. This is still a <em>really </em>slim phone.</p><p>Constructed with a satin metal frame with matte glass and a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 screen, it also sports a durable hinge made of multi-alloy steel with an aerospace-grade high-strength aluminum alloy cover. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">his review</a>, Andrew Myrick says he finds the phone slippery to hold without a case. You’ll want one anyway, though he does admit that it’s stunning in the looks department.</p><p>There’s standard water-resistance protection with an IPX8 rating. That’s nothing to discount, but it isn’t quite as durable as the OPPO Find N5 in this department. The phone comes with the option of 256GB or 512GB storage.</p><p>In terms of the battery, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a smaller 4,650mAh battery, though Google still rates it as being able to last all day. You can also leverage Extreme Battery Saver mode to get up to 72 hours of use per charge. Once ready to charge, it is compatible with 45W USB-C charging (charger sold separately) as well as wireless charging through Qi. Myrick says battery life was better than he expected, and he loves the option for wireless charging when using a MagSafe case. Just make sure to find a case with the proper alignment, which rules out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Pixel Stand V2</a>.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold runs Android 14 but it comes with seven years of OS and security updates, giving you even more peace of mind that you can use the phone for many years to come.</p>
<h2 id="oppo-find-n5-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-the-specs-2">OPPO Find N5 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: The specs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<h2 id="oppo-find-n5-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-usability-and-features-2">OPPO Find N5 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Usability and features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vCMDvCbBo9qGhPSvUfpVo4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 drawer on the taskbar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCMDvCbBo9qGhPSvUfpVo4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, we have established that both these phones are beautifully designed with bright screens, wonderful folding capabilities, and ultra-thin designs. Now, it comes down to how they function with day-to-day use and what they can do.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 runs on the ColorOS, which is based on Android 15. It also has a trinity engine and generous 16GB RAM, so it will keep up with all your multitasking needs, videos, gaming, and more. It uses a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and Jonnalagadda finds that it runs just as well as other premium phones that have this same processor. There was some throttling, however, so it doesn’t live up to the same thermal thresholds.</p><p>Phones nowadays are all about the AI experience, and the OPPO Find N5 delivers the full Google Gemini experience, with features like AI Translate, dual-screen interpreter, AI Assistant for documents, AI call summaries, and Circle to Search.</p><p>There are a few neat stand-out features with this phone. This includes a 360° surround, AI-driven adaptive antenna system that can apparently adjust the signal based on how you hold the phone. In comparing it to other phones he has recently tested, Jonnalagadda says the OPPO Fins N5 affords reliable connectivity, so perhaps this technology really does work.</p><p>By downloading the O+ Connect app to your Mac, you can also enable a Mac Remote feature. Once connected, use the phone to search, access, edit, and sync files on your Mac remotely. There are also useful features like split and boundless views. All your files are protected as well thanks to theft protection and delete file encryption.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DLQafRTYoDpJydKNjLLvsB" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review -" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLQafRTYoDpJydKNjLLvsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not surprisingly, the AI experience is top-notch with the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Running Android 14 out of the box (though you can update to Android 15 now) with a Google Tensor 4 chip, it has the same 16GB RAM, which will delight heavy users and mobile gamers.</p><p>Google AI is fully integrated into the experience, from the Google AI assistant to features like summarizing e-mails, Circle to Search, Google Translate, and, of course, Google Gemini for assisting in just about anything you are doing, want to do, or are starting to plan to do. In fact, you can take the experience a step further since a purchase of the phone comes with a one-year subscription to Gemini Advanced to try out everything it has to offer.</p><p>The Google AI experience, Myrick notes, is virtually identical to what you’ll get in other new Pixel phones in terms of capabilities, features, and limitations. Indeed, it sort of works sometimes and doesn’t at others. But this is true for any phone with Gemini, not just this one.</p><p>There are some other unique features worth mentioning with this phone, too. Leverage the split screen feature to use two apps side by side. You can drag and drop items from one app to another. There’s also a feature that can automatically detect and filter spam calls.

<p>Who doesn’t take photos from their phones nowadays? With foldable phones affording even more convenient ways to take images, essentially with their own built-in tripods, you’ll want to know which phone yields the better turnout.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 has a camera system that was co-developed with Hasselblad, which already tells you that there are pretty solid cameras built into this device. This triple-camera system includes a 50MP HyperTone wide-angle lens with OIS, a 50MP Samsung telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and an 8MP wide-angle. For the front, it’s another 8MP camera.</p><p>Since the camera bump protrudes quite a bit from the back, Jonnalagadda says you will find that there’s a slight wobble when you try to take pics with the unfolded phone resting on a table or other flat surface.</p><p>Enjoy tons of AI camera shooting features, including AI telescope zoom, telephoto macro camera, LivePhoto, portrait mode, soft light portrait, and new film style. There’s even an option to add a personalized watermark to your images. For AI editing, use features like AI Clarity Enhancer, AI Eraser, AI Unblur, and AI Reflection Remover. With the FlexForm camera, you can use the rear cameras to take selfies from different angles, like a high-res selfie or waist-level framing.</p><p>Jonnalagadda was thoroughly impressed with the cameras in this phone, calling the images he was able to take in daylight “outstanding,” highlighting the wonderful dynamic range and white balance. They deliver natural colors with no aggressive smoothing or oversaturation. Even macro photos turned out great. The only weak point, he feels, is the wide-angle lens, though he admits it still takes decent photos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PXm3NvfaCsW5LSYMPay5QN" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-18.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold angled view of back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXm3NvfaCsW5LSYMPay5QN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cameras in the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold are similar in comparison, based on specs. You get a 48MP main wide-angle camera along with a 10.5MP ultra-wide lens with Macro focus, 10.8MP rear, 10MP cover, and a 10MP camera inside. There’s also 5x telephoto zoom and up to 20x Super Res Zoom so you can get up close and personal with subjects that might be far away, from birds to your kid’s amazing goal at the soccer game.</p><p>Myrick finds that photos are hit-and-miss with the cameras in this phone, largely dependent on the scenario and conditions in which you’re trying to shoot.</p><p>Google really hits it out of the park with fun and useful photo features, though. There’s the option to use the rear camera for a front screen preview of an image you’re about to take. Parents will love Made You Look, which displays fun pics to make kids laugh or smile so you get the perfect shot. Myrick found that the feature works incredibly well, especially with his fidgety 8-month-old. Leverage tabletop mode to take timed group shots, timelapse, astro photos and more. You can even just say “Hey Google, take a photo” and it will.</p><p>The pièce de résistance is Add Me, which allows the photographer to add themselves to a group photo after the fact so that no one is left out. Best Take is another fan favorite, which allows you to combine the best expressions or backgrounds from various burst photos to save the, well, best take. Of course, you also get other great Pixel photo features you know and love from other Pixel devices, like Magic Eraser, Magic Editor, Photo Unblur, and more.</p>

<p>We’re not going to lie: when deciding between the OPPO Find N5 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it’s a tough decision. The one easy deciding factor could simply be availability. If you’re in North America and can’t get your hands on the OPPO Find N5, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a fine foldable that won’t disappoint, and your only choice between the two.</p><p>If you have the opportunity to buy either one, this is when it gets murkier. They are both great phones, but the OPPO Find N5 improves in virtually every department, from the screen sizes and resolution to the thinner and more durable design, the larger battery, infinitely faster charging, and better cameras. There’s just that one nagging annoyance that you might not be able to get it.</p><p>If you’re looking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phone</a>, there are other models to consider as well from Samsung, Motorola, and the aforementioned OnePlus Open which <em>is </em>available in North America. But between these two devices, the OPPO Find N5 is the choice to make if it’s available to you. If not, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is still a great foldable with fun features and lots of AI goodies.</p><p>The good news is that since the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is guaranteed software support for so long, you can invest now.

<ul><li>Smart Connect, used by nine million monthly active users, is getting new updates.</li><li>The Smart Connect gets a new customizable dashboard alongside third-party integration that lets more Android users experience the feature.</li><li>The aim of the new AI features incorporation is to retrieve information in seconds, further saving consumers time and energy.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Smart Connect is a cross-device management solution that works seamlessly between Motorola and Lenovo devices, which is now getting new updates alongside some useful AI features.</p><p>The company has announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a> will be receiving new features in the coming weeks that include a redesigned dashboard, third-party integration, and a couple of AI-powered features. While select Motorola and Lenovo users can download the update through Google Play Store, Windows PC users (Windows 10 and above) can get it through the Microsoft Store.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vv8tucBsSues88gisqSy93" name="Smart-Connect-update-02" alt="Smart Connect new update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vv8tucBsSues88gisqSy93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart Connect's new customized dashboard, now showcases users' compatible devices including Moto Tag, Moto Buds, Lenovo Tabs, and PCs. The company notes that this should help users manage, add, or disconnect devices easily and also check their battery life. Third-party integration with the latest update will also allow more Android users to experience the benefits of Smart Connect features.</p><p>Other than cross-device integration and file management, the Smart Connect feature will now have a boost of Moto AI to elevate the experience. For instance, with a quick voice or text command, users will be able to cast their phone's content to TV, PC, or a tablet — during a presentation, for example.</p>

<p>AI Search further allows users to utilize natural language to roll out some basic tasks, like bringing out documents from their tablet, like a bank statement, rental agreement, or a hotel bill stored on the Lenovo Yoga Tab Plus tablet, the company explains in a shared press release.</p><p>"Say a user is returning from a weeklong business trip and needs to submit their expense report. They can forget about manually sorting through various folders or files. Instead, they simply ask Smart Connect to “grab my restaurant receipts” in a natural way, as if they were speaking to a friend."</p><p>The aim is to retrieve information in seconds, further saving consumers time and energy. It is good to see Smart Connect gaining AI benefits alongside its core features like Miracast display connectivity, Smart Clipboard, and App Streaming, which is believed to be utilized by over nine million monthly users.</p>

<p>Google wants <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome</a> for Android to feel more immersive, so apps will now stretch to the very edges of your screen, right under the status and navigation bars.</p><p>The search giant announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/edge-to-edge" target="_blank">community post</a> that it started testing a new version of Chrome for Android that aims to maximize your screen space for a smoother, more immersive experience (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/02/chrome-135-edge-to-edge-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The visual below shows Chrome's UI stretching seamlessly to the bottom edge, with content flowing into the navigation bar area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iQtLFx2GtBngFNtYE8FzMW" name="Google-Chrome-on-Android-edge-to-edge" alt="Visualizations of the viewport in Chrome that is not edge-to-edge and is edge-to-edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iQtLFx2GtBngFNtYE8FzMW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Google, the new Chrome update brings a smart bottom bar that disappears when you scroll, freeing up more space for content under the navigation bar.</p><p>The Chrome team made sure it works with current mobile web designs, but Google is also warning developers to watch out for possible overlaps with the gesture navigation bar.</p><p>This is a big shift from the current setup, where the gesture pill sits on a plain, solid-color background. The new tweak has a more dynamic look, with content flowing right behind it.</p><p>When the update is rolled out to everyone, the gesture handle will float over content on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a> as you scroll. But when you’re not scrolling and the address bar is visible, it’ll go back to the classic solid-color background.</p><p>Even though edge-to-edge screen rendering is possible, it hasn’t been widely adopted because of some real-world design challenges. For one, app controls and the system’s navigation bar can end up on top of each other, leading to accidental taps or swipes.</p><p>To tackle these issues, Google last year gave developers the tools and guidance needed for smooth edge-to-edge rendering. The tech giant also sent out a heads-up, warning that apps without the right updates might run into display glitches.</p><p>Google has started rolling out the edge-to-edge layout in Chrome 135 for Android, but it’s only live for a small group of users right now.</p>

<p>HMD has introduced a fresh take on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, and they’re not your average pair. These come with a charging case that can also give your phone a quick power boost when it’s running low.</p><p>At MWC in Barcelona, HMD unveiled the Amped Earbuds, a fresh addition to its accessory lineup. What makes them stand out is their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">Qi2</a> reverse charging case. With a 1,600mAh battery, it doesn’t just juice up the earbuds: it doubles as a wireless power bank for compatible phones, including iPhones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD’s own Skyline</a>.</p><p>HMD also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_int/press/hmd-amped-buds-press-release" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the Amped Buds' charging case works even if your phone has a protective case with a magnetic ring. This means it’s built to play nice with pretty much any phone that supports wireless charging.</p><p>This clever two-in-one design gives the Amped Earbuds an edge, making them a standout in the crowded world of audio gear.</p><p>HMD says the case’s battery can give your iPhone 16 Pro a 20% boost wirelessly, or bump it up to 24% if you plug in with a USB-C cable.</p><p>At first look, the earbuds seem like your typical wireless earbuds, with just a slightly different stem design to set them apart. It’s chunkier than usual at 14mm thick, and the hinge system for storing and charging the earbuds is a nifty little detail you don’t see every day.</p><p>The earbuds use a spring-loaded system; pop them in or out of the case, and you’ll hear and feel a tiny click. And when you pull them out, the stems tilt forward, so they sit just right in your ears.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Despite the somewhat underwhelming appeal of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> strictly on the spec sheet, Samsung has somehow found a way to make it a compelling flagship. After spending weeks with the smartphone as my daily driver, I happen to specifically enjoy the compact form factor and lightweight build. With that being said, the more and more I use the Galaxy S25, the more clear it becomes that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> is a huge selling point for this lineup.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, you get the best of both worlds in terms of smartphone AI. Of course, there's Galaxy AI, which is Samsung's in-house suite of AI tools. However, on top of that, the Galaxy S25 also supports a large variety of Google AI features — including the new agentic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, Circle to Search, and Magic Editor, for starters. Crucially, Samsung is offering an unprecedented level of control over where your data is processed with its recent Galaxy lineups.</p><p>In the <strong>Galaxy AI </strong>tab in the Settings app for the Galaxy S25, there's a toggle called <strong>Process data only on device</strong>. It does exactly what it sounds like. "For added privacy, you can prevent collection and processing of your data for Galaxy AI's advanced intelligence features," the company explains. "Online processing provides the best results and is required for some advanced intelligence features."</p>

<p>To be fair, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a> isn't new at all. The Samsung Galaxy S25 uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy </a>chip for on-device AI computing, just like how a Google Pixel phone uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip for the same thing. In fact, the Galaxy S24 has this very same toggle available. The key difference here is that Google doesn't let you switch off cloud processing altogether, and compared to the Galaxy S24, the newer Galaxy S25 can run many more Galaxy AI features on-device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8je8SnkHAN2KBxVdnUNcTK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-7" alt="Android eating Baklava generated on Galaxy S25 Ultra using Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8je8SnkHAN2KBxVdnUNcTK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An image generated with AI using the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last year, disabling cloud processing for Galaxy AI meant leaving behind nearly all of the suite's best features. Thanks to the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip, that isn't necessary anymore. You can use some or all of the following Galaxy AI feature with on-device processing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Call Assist</li><li>Writing Assist</li><li>Interpreter</li><li>Note Assist</li><li>Transcript Assist</li><li>Browsing Assist</li></ul>
<p>This makes using on-device processing only on your Samsung Galaxy S25 a much more viable option this year compared to last. Of course, there are still some sacrifices to be made. Summarization features across Writing Assist, Note Assist, and Browsing Assist won't work with cloud processing disabled. Moreover, the best Photo Assist features — including Sketch to edit and Portrait studio — won't work with on-device processing either.</p><p>Regardless, these limitations are a bit easier to concede with the Galaxy S25, since you retain access to some of the more useful Galaxy AI tools. It's at least worth considering for the extremely privacy-conscious, even if many Galaxy S25 users aren't likely to flip the toggle on. I probably won't restrict my Galaxy phone to on-device AI either, but there's something to be said about Samsung at least giving users the final choice — that's more than Google or Apple can say. That's what Android is all about, after all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tSX8PCRhqmicp6VXHdA92e" name="Galaxy-S25-On-Device-AI-2" alt="The option for processing all data on-device." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tSX8PCRhqmicp6VXHdA92e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If I'm a Pixel or iPhone user today, I'm envious of the choice Samsung is providing to Galaxy S25 users — and even users of older Galaxy phones. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-gemini-nano-available-for-all-android-apps">Gemini Nano model</a> to process data on-device, there's no way to force the smartphone to <em>only</em> use on-device processing.</p><p>The same goes for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-has-turned-into-just-another-tech-company">the iPhone 16 series and its A18 chips</a>. Apple has the groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute system for off-device processing, but it does not tell the end user exactly where their data is being processed for any specific feature. There's a degree of uncertainty there that requires a level of trust. For some, it doesn't make sense to put trust in AI and corporate data collection.</p><p>Even the Galaxy S25 isn't perfect, if only because Samsung can only control what it can control. The on-device processing toggle only covers Galaxy AI features — it excludes any Google AI or Gemini features. Still, Samsung is setting the standard for user choice when it comes to on-device processing for AI features, and it deserves a commendation for that.</p>

<hr>
<p>Infinix is finally jumping in with its own tri-fold design, called the Zero Mini Tri-Fold, which boasts dual vertical hinges that let it fold three ways.</p><p>The Infinix Zero Mini concept introduces triple-fold design, powered by dual vertical hinges. Unlike your typical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> that just stretch into bigger screens, Infinix's latest concept phone can switch between being a compact phone, a fitness gadget you can wear, and a portable camera setup, according to the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/infinix-unveils-zero-series-mini-tri-fold-a-game-changing-foldable-concept-302387349.html" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>With its outward-folding design, the Zero Mini goes beyond a regular phone. It can attach to fitness gear and bikes, making it even more versatile.</p><p>The Zero Mini’s outward-folding design gives you a dual-screen setup that’s perfect for multitasking.

With an aluminum chassis, a powerful MediaTek processor, a gorgeous 144Hz display, and <em>eight</em> speakers for the ultimate in surround sound from a tablet, this one means business.</p><p>It's the perfect tablet for productivity <em>and</em> media consumption, offering everything you need to feel good about using it full-time. It's got full support for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/global/accessories/honor-magic-pencil-3/">Honor Magic Pencil 3</a> and a keyboard folio case that turns it into a laptop replacement, plus a 10,100mAh battery that'll last all day long on a single charge.</p><p>Honor's strengthened partnership with Google means that it's even got Google Kids Space support out of the box, so you can set it up entirely for your kids to use with a special home screen launcher and set of apps or just make them their own profile with all the same great parental control features. Really, it's hard to know why you would need any other tablet.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bx7GAdnctYbXUJajGxGFU4" name="honor-pad-v9-back-holding-kid-playing" alt="A child holding the Honor Pad V9 tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bx7GAdnctYbXUJajGxGFU4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Honor Pad V9 was announced on MWC 2025 on March 2, 2025.</p><p>The tablet is expected to retail for around $400 and is the follow-up to 2022's Honor Pad V8 Pro.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-pad-v9-what-makes-it-great"><span>Honor Pad V9: What makes it great</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oqpd2gvmMMJgZt6sQ5cAMM" name="honor-pad-v9-display-camera-scan-01" alt="A ramen cooking comic on the display of the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oqpd2gvmMMJgZt6sQ5cAMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Honor Pad V9 has stunning physical features, and it's hard to pick the best one. The aluminum unibody design feels incredibly high-quality and far better than you might expect from a sub-$400 tablet. The bezels around the display are just the right size — not too big to look ugly and not too small to be uncomfortable — and the tablet is thin enough to be comfortable without being so thin that it's awkward to hold.</p><p>LCD screens <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-16e-oled-display-signals-death-of-lcd">aren't necessarily considered "premium"</a> these days, but the one on the Honor Pad V9 might have you rethinking that position. At 144Hz, it's buttery smooth and uses dynamic dimming and refresh rate scaling to save on battery. The backlight looks superb and avoids the cheap glow or light bleed issues some LCD panels suffer from. It's also got incredible viewing angles and black levels, once again showing that this is better than the average LCD panel.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uh0ShSU8PEU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>It's a proper DC-dimmed panel and uses no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, earning the full TÜV Rheinland Flicker Free Eye Comfort Certification rating. Plus, it blocks blue light at the hardware level and incorporates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">Honor's Defocus Display tech,</a> so you can feel comfortable using it night and day without eye strain.</p><p>Aside from the quality, the display is coated with a NIL Nano-topography process that keeps it impressively fingerprint-resistant. I've let my son play on this thing for hours and can't believe how little there is to clean off the screen. I'd love to see some kind of anti-glare layer on this display in the future but it's still plenty bright and easy to see in a well-lit car.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6QnMZzAymyqVMN2G7vB7de" name="honor-pad-v9-charging-01" alt="Charging the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6QnMZzAymyqVMN2G7vB7de.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Among the most premium features is the IMAX certified 8-speaker setup. Yeah, seriously, Honor packed <em>eight speakers</em> inside of this tablet, complete with impressive bass response. Movies and videos sounded best, with crystal clear voices and mind-bowing virtual surround sound.</p><p>I did a sort of double-take more than once while watching videos on this thing, wondering if it somehow was hooked up to my surround sound system in the living room. It sounds good enough to listen to music on all the time and I had it pumping beats on my desk while I was working more than once during the review period.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gqqcCdn4zsowNbqsnxt9uN" name="honor-pad-v9-google-kids-space-home-screen" alt="Google Kids Space running on the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gqqcCdn4zsowNbqsnxt9uN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Parents will be thrilled to know that this tablet features Google Kids Space support out of the box. When setting up any account, it'll ask you if the account is for a child or an adult. Choosing child will enable a special setup that requires a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">Google Family Link account</a>, complete with a special home screen, app launcher, curated content, and more.</p><p>The MediaTek Dimensity 8350 Elite inside is a great processor that's somewhere in-between a mid-range and a top-end processor. It feels like a high-end processor in most scenarios, including everyday usage, browsing, and productivity. Gaming on the tablet is a joy although you won't be able to run Fortnite at max settings and still expect a buttery-smooth 60FPS framerate.</p><p>If you or your kids are looking for a great tablet that supports a stylus, this is a solid choice. It works perfectly with the Honor Magic Pencil 3, including handwriting recognition and Honor's really cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-magicpad-2-ai-math-equation-digitizer">math formula recognition technology</a>. This functionality along with Kids Space makes this an ideal family tablet, especially since you can have multiple account profiles.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-pad-v9-what-needs-work"><span>Honor Pad V9: What needs work</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sqLMehCp86PYXhyApLbsqN" name="honor-pad-v9-display-quick-toggles-notification-shade" alt="The waste of space that occurs when pulling up the split notification pane on the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sqLMehCp86PYXhyApLbsqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">affordable tablet</a>, you'll find that Honor sells other tablets with faster processors, bigger and brighter displays, and slightly better speakers. I wouldn't say any of these are huge differences from what's offered on the Honor Pad V9, but know that this isn't quite a top-of-the-line tablet despite its premium leanings. It also has no water or dust ingress protection, so this one might not be best for bathtub reading time.</p><p>On the software side of things, Honor does a great job of enabling laptop-level multitasking and performance in many areas, but it needs to tweak just two things to bring this all the way to a laptop-replacement level. The taskbar at the bottom of the screen cannot be pinned in Magic OS 9 as it can on most other major Android-based tablets with the latest versions of Android.</p><p>Second, the notification shade is still split, so only quick toggles appear when you swipe down from the right side of the status bar, while only notifications appear from the left side. There's no reason these shouldn't be in the same notification shade as there's plenty of room for both — Honor's design even leaves a goofy white space on each half of the notification shade that <em>should</em> contain the other half.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ctKWckFi7imNB8LD8YkbWA" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-with-galaxy-s23-fe.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE in keyboard case with Galaxy S23 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ctKWckFi7imNB8LD8YkbWA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No matter where you live, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">best Samsung tablets</a> are often the biggest competition for the Honor Pad V9. The closest specific competitor is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE,</a> which is in the same price range as the Honor Pad V9. Samsung offers a lot of similar functionality to the Honor Pad V9 including stylus support and a great OS for multitasking. However, Honor outclasses Samsung in most other areas, including processor performance, display quality and refresh rate, eye-friendly display options, and much more RAM.</p><p>If you're a smart home aficionado and use Google Home as your main control point, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> is a pretty nifty choice. It's got a great charging stand that doubles as a powerful speaker, plus a custom lock screen that lets you control your Google Home-powered smart home faster than anything else. It's got a slightly better multitasking UI than Honor — the taskbar can be properly pinned to the bottom of the screen — but the processor is a lot slower, and it only has 8GB of RAM, while Honor offers a Pad V9 model with 12GB.</p><p>Internationally, companies like Xiaomi offer tablets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmi-pad-pro-review">Redmi Pad Pro</a> that look <em>very</em> similar on paper. Honor offers more storage and RAM for its two models as well as a newer version of Android, plus a much faster processor. Xiaomi has the price advantage, though, and some people may prefer Xiaomi's Android skin over Honor's.</p>

<p>The Honor Pad V9 sits nicely between cheap tablets like the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and more premium options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>. It's got a powerful newer MediaTek processor, an incredible 144Hz display that'll have you wondering why more LCDs aren't this good, as well as an impressive 8-speaker system that sounds too good to be in a tablet.</p><p>Honor even launched this one with the latest version of Android, fixing past mistakes. It also includes Honor's latest display eye care solutions, support for its best tablet accessories like the Magic Pencil 3, and battery life that'll get you through the longest of flights. It's a superb choice, so long as you don't need something special like ingress protection or cellular connectivity.</p>

There has been a sizeable interest in this category in the last 12 months, and Honor's buds combine a lightweight design with a comfortable fit and engaging sound signature. <br><br>What's so good about open earbuds is that they don't actually fit inside the ear, so you don't need to worry about any strain even with extended use. That said, because they don't create a tight seal, you don't get the same sound quality, but manufacturers have come up with interesting solutions to deliver powerful bass, and Honor in particular did a terrific job in this area. <br><br>I tested several open earbuds, and after using the Earbuds Open for a week, it's evident that these are among the best you can get right now.</p>

<p>Honor unveiled the Earbuds Open alongside the Pad V9 at its Mobile World Congress keynote on March 2, and the earbuds are going on sale shortly. Similar to the manufacturer's other devices, the Earbuds Open will be coming to the U.K. and other global markets in the coming weeks.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d9RqevviA2q75ZYyK3cs8A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d9RqevviA2q75ZYyK3cs8A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I generally like open earbuds as they have a better fit than in-ear models, and that's no different with the Earbuds Open. I think these may be the most comfortable earbuds I've used yet, and while I tested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/baseus-eli-sport-1-review">Baseus's take in this category</a> and am going through several other models — this is clearly the latest trend in audio — Honor's design is the one that stands out the most.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ptuxGBqQmJQ6gUSt2otd6A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ptuxGBqQmJQ6gUSt2otd6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big part of that has to do with the unique design. The Earbuds Open have ear hooks that ensure they don't fall out even when you're running, and as the driver doesn't actually nestle into your ear canal — it's designed to sit outside the ear — it doesn't exert any pressure on the inner ear cavity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G33rPVkULv5eEpE24jLM5A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G33rPVkULv5eEpE24jLM5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because of the design, you can hear ambient noise in your surroundings while still getting immersive sound, and there's no audio leakage, so no one in your near vicinity will be able to hear what you're listening to — which is a good thing for me as I mostly listen to heavy metal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="A8uJu4SgFVngGSNfiggW5A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A8uJu4SgFVngGSNfiggW5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ear hooks have a natural curve and are made out of an alloy that makes it easy to adjust the fit comfortably. The chassis is fashioned out of silicone, and I didn't see any issues with the build quality. The earbuds weigh just 7.9g each, so there's absolutely no fatigue even with all-day use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wryWGgo9xLs273K39xFj6A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wryWGgo9xLs273K39xFj6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can get the earbuds in Polar Gold and Polar Black, and I'd recommend getting the gold model if you want earbuds with a bit of a design flair. The black model is muted, and it doesn't have a strong presence; so if that's what you need, it's a good option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TaJdWJrdciUzDD45BA3M9A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TaJdWJrdciUzDD45BA3M9A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The case has an oblong design to accommodate the unique nature of the earbuds, and while it is wider than most earbud cases, it is still easily pocketable. Pairing the buds is about as easy as it gets (they connect over Bluetooth 5.2), and I didn't have any issues in this area. I got good range too, with the earbuds delivering a rock-solid connection even when I around the house doing chores. If you're prone to losing earbuds, there's a nifty locate option that uses Bluetooth.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SWjkUKn5B6y29d85wCan7A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SWjkUKn5B6y29d85wCan7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get IP54 ingress protection, and they hold up incredibly well during workouts thanks to the ear hooks. Interestingly, you get ANC on these earbuds, and while the isolation isn't as high as regular earbuds — the Buds 3 Pro manage to tune out sounds up to 40db, while the Earbuds Open can do so up to 24dB — it is a considerable achievement that this is available on open earbuds at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FRgBGzFnSLVTASgyLtRo6A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FRgBGzFnSLVTASgyLtRo6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the earbuds did a decent enough job with ambient sounds like that of an air conditioning unit, they're not quite as effective if you're in a noisy cafe. There's environmental noise isolation as well, with the earbuds doing a great job blocking out the wind, and it is easily noticeable while making calls outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ptuxGBqQmJQ6gUSt2otd6A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ptuxGBqQmJQ6gUSt2otd6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used a half-dozen open earbuds until now, and I'm constantly amazed by how good they sound. You wouldn't think that the sound quality would be on par with regular earbuds as they don't go into your ear, but that isn't the case at all — if anything, the Earbuds Open sound better than most in-ear models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bzG989ZJWGwz6fiQuTMU7A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bzG989ZJWGwz6fiQuTMU7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What surprised me the most is the bass; the Earbuds Open have a vibrant and engaging bass that works across genres, and you somehow get a noticeable rumble even though the sound tube doesn't wedge into the inner ear. There's good mid-range clarity, with vocals shining through and decent instrument separation. There's some harshness with the treble at times, but you don't get much in the way of sibilance. Overall, I'd sum up the sound quality as lively; it lends itself well to diverse genres, and Honor did a great job with the tuning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JDQtKyfsaSS2rudvSFAx6A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JDQtKyfsaSS2rudvSFAx6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like with everything else Honor is doing, the Earbuds Open pick up AI-assisted features, including real-time translations. It is available in 15 languages, but I wasn't able to make full use of it as it doesn't have Hindi or Telugu (yet). That said, it works with Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Portuguese in addition to other languages, and it is a nifty addition. <br><br>You get three modes: Shared Mode is ideal when you need instantaneous translations, Simultaneous Interpretation is pretty cool in that it spits out translations in two languages at once (with one language in each earbud), and Exclusive Mode is useful if you're in a country where you don't know the language. In this mode, you talk into the earbuds and the connected phone's speaker puts out the translation in the language selected in real-time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XkFufWv3AWF3P29D85DN5A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XkFufWv3AWF3P29D85DN5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, the battery life is decent. Each bud houses a 58mAh battery and lasts just under six hours between charges, and there's a 480mAh battery within the case that charges the buds two and a half times over. Basically, you get over 20 hours of usage before needing to charge the case. On that note, there's fast charging, so a 15-minute charge delivers two hours of music playback.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hrYzkPdTtf2rgkwHeJqF5A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrYzkPdTtf2rgkwHeJqF5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't really have many negatives to point out with the buds. I would have liked the integration of AptX codecs, but that clearly isn't a priority in this category, and it isn't a huge omission al things considered.</p><p>The buds have gesture controls, but they tend to be finicky at times, and I ran into issues getting a gesture to trigger reliably. The only other point is the fit; while I like the way they sit outside the ear, they may not be suitable to everyone, and if it's possible, I'd recommend trying out the buds if you're interested in the design.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-earbuds-open-the-alternatives"><span>Honor Earbuds Open: The alternatives</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kZZhgeUYGm9MMZ3nDzup5A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZZhgeUYGm9MMZ3nDzup5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like what Nothing is doing in this category, and its earbuds combine a comfortable fit with great sound. Coming in at €149, they are costlier, but you also get a good value considering the uniqueness of the design and engaging sound. <br><br>Soundcore's AeroFit Pro share a lot of the same attributes as Honor's earbuds, and they have decent sound combined with useful workout extras, including IPX5.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-earbuds-open-should-you-buy-it"><span>Honor Earbuds Open: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8QHcc8FMTwntwtRe4tkf7A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8QHcc8FMTwntwtRe4tkf7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy these if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want earbuds that are highly comfortable</li><li>You need great sound quality with powerful bass</li><li>You want good battery life</li><li>You need workout earbuds</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best noise isolation</li><li>You need high-res codecs</li></ul>
<p>Outside of AptX codecs, you're not really missing out on much with the Earbuds Open. Honor did a terrific job with the design and build quality of the earbuds, and they're easily one of the most comfortable I've used in this category. <br><br>The fact that you don't have any fatigue even with all-day use is a big deal, and that's driven by the unique design where the driver sits outside the ear. You still get wonderfully detailed sound, and Honor somehow managed to deliver powerful bass here, and they hold up well with genres as diverse as heavy metal and classical. <br><br>There are other niceties too; IP54 ingress protection is great to have, and the earbuds do a solid job tuning out ambient sounds. They're not quite as effective as regular earbuds, but there is a noticeable difference regardless, and if you usually have issues with earbuds and want something that's much more comfortable, I highly recommend giving the Earbuds Open a chance — I was pleasantly astonished by how good they are, and you will be too.</p>

<hr>
<p>HONOR is making a decisive announcement today (Mar 2) about its newfound commitment toward device sustainability.</p><p>In a press release, HONOR announced that it has committed to bringing seven years of major Android OS updates and security updates to its Magic series. The company explains it made this move for the sake of device sustainability and “responsibility.” According to HONOR, providing seven years of updates is, in its eyes, a “pioneering step” toward reducing e-waste and supporting a more “circular economy.”</p><p>HONOR says that while seven years is a few years higher than the industry’s typically offered three to five years of support, it also aligns with the EU’s regulations. The region’s Circular Economy and Ecodesign regulations are what it’s referencing, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en">the latter focused on</a> reducing climate change and pollution as a result of discarded tech products.</p><p>Of course, extending update support to seven years for Android upgrades and security fixes benefits the consumer. HONOR states it hopes this move will instill “confidence” in its consumers that their Magic series devices will “remain up-to-date, secure, and feature-rich” throughout its lifespan.</p><p>Having an assortment of features not only references pieces of software like MagicOS 9.0 (Android 15), but also the AI tools HONOR has in store.</p><p>Honor is prepared for the “Age of AI” and it plans to ensure its products can walk that journey, too. The post states its seven year commitment to the Magic series regarding updates concerns its AI software, as well. “For years to come,” Honor says its Magic series phones will enjoy “cutting-edge” AI features and “innovative” functions.</p>

<p>There is a lot more that Honor has in store during MWC 2025 in Barcelona. As a teaser, the company states consumers should look forward to its complete Honor ALPHA PLAN, which is a new “strategic vision” regarding its software and how it can work to improve your life.</p><p>Honor states it’s pleased to join the top three global brands globally in delivering seven years of Android and security updates to its users. The company is likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">referring to Samsung</a> and Google, which have both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">committed to</a> such a lifespan extension for its phones.</p><p>While we await the rest of Honor’s announcements, the company<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-teases-new-ios-cross-device-features-coming-soon"> briefly teased</a> what its Alpha Plan could be earlier this week. Honor alluded to boosting its AI software with cross-platform integration, meaning it has Apple’s iOS devices in its sights for better compatibility with its own products. The rest of its Alpa Plan seems to concern creating an open, collaborative AI ecosystem through “global partnerships.”</p><p>These partnerships <em>could </em>involve Google’s Gemini model. It’s worth noting that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a> already incorporates the DeepSeek LLM into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-teams-up-with-gemini-and-chatgpts-biggest-rival-to-level-up-its-ai-assistant">YOYO assistant</a>. We’ll just have to wait and see what MWC 2025 holds for Honor officially when it kicks off on March 3.</p>

<hr>
<p>As MWC has just begun, Honor has announced that it aims to convert the company into a global AI device ecosystem. To do so, the company has announced that it is introducing a new Honor Alpha Plan, a three-step strategy, that focuses on intelligent phones, AI ecosystem, and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).</p><p>According to Honor, the new Alpha plan comprises three steps that include the development of an intelligent phone, opening industry boundaries, and co-create a new paradigm of AI ecosystem, lastly, with the help of AGI, Honor intends to "open human potential boundaries and co-create a new paradigm for civilization."</p>
<p>The said intelligent phone will be incorporating human-centric AI — primarily built to maximize human potential. Honor also shared its plans to bring the world's first GUI (Graphical User Interface)-based mobile AI agent. The company is also partnering with Google Cloud and Qualcomm Technologies and demonstrated the AI agent in making a table reservation through a third-party service at the keynote.</p><p>Honor has also announced a new imaging technology called AiMAGE. It utilizes an AI Kernel to run device-cloud AI models, aiming to enhance image clarity. The company further plans to integrate more AI features, like AI Upscale for restoring old portraits by partnering with services like Google Cloud. We will be the first to witness it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 </a>series, which is said to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Honor has also shared that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honors-latest-ai-features-want-to-fight-deep-fake-videos-and-eye-strain">Deepfake detection</a> will be arriving on its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> in international markets.</p><p>Honor aims to bring AI to the masses, and as a testament to its commitment, the company has announced that it will be investing over $10 billion over the next five years to fund the endeavor.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the AI revolution will reshape the paradigm of the device industry - completely transforming our productivity, our society, and even our culture more than ever before,” said James Li, CEO of Honor.</p><p>“I am calling on all of us to unite together to address the challenges – as well as the many opportunities – of AI technology. I also call on the industry to be truly open so that we can fully embrace this exciting AI future. Let’s do it together.”</p><p>“As we move into the physical AI era, we need to open our industry boundaries and co-create a new paradigm for the AI ecosystem,” Li further added. He also believes that by working together to maximize their potential, they can aim to create a new paradigm in the AGI era, where carbon-based life and silicon-based intelligence co-exist.</p><p>Lastly, the Alpha plan's emphasis can be witnessed first in Honor's phones starting with the Magic series, as they are now promised seven years of Android OS and security updates, starting with the European region.</p>

<p>The Android Central team reviews dozens of smartwatches, smart rings, wireless earbuds, and other fitness-related accessories every year. But which devices do we <strong>buy for ourselves</strong> or <strong>keep using</strong> after the review ends?</p><p>I asked my Android Central colleagues, both full-time and freelance, to share their fitness insights. I asked which fitness apps they rely on as they switch from Samsung to Garmin to Fitbit — the baseline software that keeps their training on point while juggling different hardware for editorials and reviews. And I asked about their favorite wearable hardware.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, they had trouble picking just one watch or app as their favorite. I also told them to keep it short and sweet, so you can see from these lengthy answers how enthusiastic our team is about fitness tech!</p><p>Below are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> and fitness apps that we prefer when we don't have a deadline, the devices we trust to keep us healthy, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">lose weight</a>, or get stronger or faster as an athlete.</p>
<h2 id="brady-snyder-nike-run-club-app-garmin-enduro-3-and-samsung-galaxy-watch-6-classic-2">Brady Snyder: Nike Run Club app, Garmin Enduro 3, and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</h2>
<p>I’ve used Nike Run Club to run over 1,500 miles across a decade and countless devices. There are a few reasons I’ve stuck by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nike.plusgps&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Run Club</strong></a> over the years, starting with the app’s compatibility. It’s available on the App Store and the Google Play Store, and there are watchOS and Wear OS apps, too. On top of that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> can automatically sync their run data with the NRC app on your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z32MkGAMauCiu5bNV4rQvP" name="nike-run-club-screenshots" alt="Screenshots from the Nike Run Club app showing a run activity, annual running stats, achievements, and challenges" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z32MkGAMauCiu5bNV4rQvP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>NRC handles the basics excellently, with the bright and bold Nike font making your pace, duration, heart rate, and more visible at a glance. It supports media playback controls, and its post-run breakdowns are both data-rich and easy to understand. Like other running apps, NRC is as much a social media app as it is a fitness tracker. Luckily, these features are actually neat, and they prioritize friendly competition with other users (with weekly challenges) and yourself (with awards and milestones) while reminding you to rest. There are also training plans and guided runs, if you’re into that.</p><p>Whether I'm using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Garmin Enduro 3</a> for battery life and training insights or my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> for better phone integration, I’ve yet to find a running app I like more than Nike Run Club.</p>

<p>I’m not the runner that folks like Brady and Michael Hicks are, but ever since writing an article on VO2 Max and how to increase it, I’ve developed a masochistic joy for running (on the treadmill, mostly). For that article, I received professional advice and some coaching from world-class, elite Olympic coaches, and I’ve been obsessed with cardio training using periodization. In three months, I raised my VO2 Max by five points, which is important for me because exercise is the most impactful medicine I use to combat my Type II diabetes. To that end, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nike.plusgps&hl=en_US"><strong>Nike Run Club</strong></a> has been an indispensable tool for helping me continue progressing and increasing my heart health.</p><p>I generally spend more time “pumping iron” than running or rucking. None of the smartwatches’ companion apps do all the things that my favorite workout journal, the Strong app, does. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.strongapp.strong&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Strong app</strong></a> helps me track historical data, but more importantly, it helps me focus on lifts and the mind/muscle connection by removing the mental load of having to remember my strength training routines for different days (leg day, push/pull, etc.).</p><p>For those days of dynamic, high-intensity workouts or when I’m lying on a flat bench, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review" target="_blank">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2</a> are my “go-to” workout earbuds. They don’t move. They sound great. On days that I choose to hit the heavy bag, I don’t have to worry about a watch not tracking my HR because the HRM in the Powerbeats Pro 2 has been rock solid so far, even keeping up beat-for-beat with my chest strap HRM.</p><p>The numbers on your scale are kaka unless those numbers are your body composition data. BMI is a terrible metric for many people, and your weight can be misleading as you start a workout regimen. That’s because muscle is more dense than fat, and as you put more of it on, it can actually look like your weight is going up! So, my favorite way of measuring physiological progress, which includes muscle gain, and fat loss, is the Withings Body Scan. The price isn’t for casual users, but using your health insurance’s FSA makes it accessible if it’s the kind of tool you need.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PDXSzw9KFA8xDA2TAMqPuS" name="Garmin-Venu-3-muscle-map.jpeg" alt="A muscle map for side lunges on the Garmin Venu 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PDXSzw9KFA8xDA2TAMqPuS.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to tracking my workouts, I often switch between a few devices. However, the one I come back to most often is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a>. It just does everything I need it to, despite its rather cumbersome UI. I’m not much of a runner, which is Garmin’s bread and butter, but the watch tracks weightlifting rather well — at least better than I’ve seen on other smartwatches I’ve used. I like that it actually attempts to count reps, automatically ends sets when it detects certain movements have stopped, and doesn’t need to be charged as often as my other devices.</p><p>What’s also nice about the Garmin app is that it syncs to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Strava</strong></a>, an app I’ve been using more often over the past several months. It’s a great app/network that lets me share my workouts with others and helps me stay accountable. Strava integrates with many different apps, so it’s easy to share activities from whatever app I use to track a workout, whether it be Garmin Connect, Oura, or Samsung Health. It’s also great because people who follow you can give you kudos whenever you post a workout/activity, which often gives me a little confidence boost.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-google-pixel-watch-3" alt="Wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3 on separate arms to compare them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've relied on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> (and its two predecessors) for keeping track of my heart rate while working out. I aim to keep BPMs in the 160s when doing more stressful cardio-heavy workouts, so wearing a watch like this is helpful to know when I need to take a small break to cool down. I also love the size and shape, as it's the most comfortable watch I've ever used when lifting barbells or bending my wrist using other equipment. Most smartwatches are just too big for this purpose and cause discomfort.</p><p>My runner-up is the newly launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, which has crazy good GPS tracking and unbelievable 4-6 day battery life. So far, I've found the heart rate monitoring to be on par with the Pixel Watch 3, making it a great alternative for when I forget to charge the Pixel Watch. It's also got substantially better metrics and software, including graphs and data that I find easier to read. While Google requires you to have a Fitbit subscription to get all the Pixel Watch's features, OnePlus gives you everything for free and does all the AI analysis and processing on your phone through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heytap.health.international" target="_blank"><strong>OHealth app</strong></a>.</p><p>Aside from smartwatches, I've also found apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.yuka.android&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Yuka</strong></a> are super helpful for a healthier overall lifestyle. Yuka helps me quickly identify foods at the grocery store that I should avoid by giving me a clear and easy breakdown of all the good and bad stuff in a product. Yuka sports a massive database with information for most foods, making it easy to avoid allergens or additives I don't want to be eating.</p>

<p>Maybe I should take some notes or something, as I think I'm one of the few at Android Central that doesn't actively work out. The only exception to that is chasing around my one-year-old so he doesn't end up getting into things he shouldn't. With that, I've spent the last month or so with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, which I picked up ahead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> launch.</p><p>Two big reasons why I opted for the Ultra over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Watch 7</a> were battery life and durability. As I've mentioned previously, I'm kind of addicted to seeing how much sleep I get every night. Looking at it every morning gives me a pretty good gauge of how the day will go or how late I can work before my brain turns to mush. Because of that, I'm not really one for charging their smartwatch overnight, as I'd prefer to wear it in order to provide more accurate results than relying on my phone.</p><p>Again, since I'm not much for working out, my other favorite app is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.homeassistant.companion.android&hl=en_US"><strong>Home Assistant</strong></a>, although until recently, it was just Google Home. When the little one is finally ready for a nap, trying to turn off the Hue bulbs in his room with Assistant can ruin any hopes of some quiet time. Thankfully, I don't have to worry about that, as I just turn off any lights I need to right from my wrist. And with Home Assistant, it just gives me control over practically all of my smart devices, even if there isn't a Wear OS companion app.</p>

<p>I use a range of devices and apps that I have enjoyed over the years. Ironically, I gave up wearing an Apple Watch about 3 years ago as it really affected my mental health, but then recently got one for Christmas and started using it only during workouts. I have enjoyed it because I am only using it while working out and for monitoring my workouts, which has been great.</p><p>For me, however, my ultimate item has been the Oura Ring. I started with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Gen 3</a> and now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Gen 4</a>. It has dramatically changed the way I look at my body. Some of my favorite features are the detailed information under your Readiness Score and my Sleep Score. I can really monitor what affected both of these categories based on my habits. And I find that overall it really has helped having a much more balanced lifestyle.</p><p>For working out in general, I do a variety of things. I used to go to a spin studio in person a few years ago, and then, over the pandemic, they came up with online classes. I use their video service with the bike I have at home for those, but additionally, I’ve consistently enjoyed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en_US"><strong>Peloton app</strong></a>. It gives so many amazing workout options like kickboxing, running classes, walking classes, yoga, pilates, and HIIT workouts. I’ve genuinely enjoyed figuring out who my favorite instructors are and the type of classes.</p>

<p>I run about 60–70 miles a month, so I need a fitness watch with long battery life, accurate GPS and heart rate, and useful training insights. While brands like COROS and Polar fit that criteria, I keep going back to Garmin watches because of its training load focus metric that tells me if I have enough low aerobic (HR zones 1–2), high aerobic (zones 3–4), and anaerobic (zone 5) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve my VO2 Max</a>. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/well/move/zone-2-exercise-benefits.html">New York Times article about Zone 2 training</a> confirms the Garmin philosophy that you need a balance of easy and max-effort training to improve, so it doesn't matter if I use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>; I just need the daily nudge to focus on the zones I've neglected.</p><p>I've used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Strava</strong></a> for years after Runtastic became Adidas Running, which drove me to switch. But I mostly used it as a log so I could check my monthly and annual stats, not caring much about its challenges or social elements. I've become more enthusiastic about it since it added and smartened up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Athlete Intelligence tool</a>. Still, its AI insights and segment leaderboards are mostly novelties for me.</p><p>When it comes to tracking my progress, I'll die on the hill that a fitness app makes things too complicated and is too interested in selling this broad, life-changing experience. All I need is a Google Doc to track my monthly mileage; I keep it open in a Chrome tab at all times so I can look at my goals — both fitness and non-fitness — to motivate me on what I need to do next!</p>

That may have been a bit premature considering I liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo X100 Ultra</a> a bit better, but it doesn't take away from the fact that the 14 Ultra continues to be a standout phone. <br><br>Xiaomi isn't changing things too much with the 15 Ultra, which is a good thing. The phone retains a massive 1-inch main camera, and you get a new 200MP tele lens that's outstanding (it uses the same Samsung HP9 imaging sensor as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>). There's a bigger battery that lasts over a day, all the high-res audio codecs you need, and all the extras you'd want in a 2025 flagship. <br><br>I used the Xiaomi 15 Ultra for a month, and that's a rarity in itself — I test most phones for a week or two before writing the review, so I was able to really get a feel for the device this time around. My key takeaway is that the phone has one of the best camera packages of 2025; it does a better job than its predecessor, and the introduction of the 200MP lens at the back means you get cleaner shots at 4x and much better portrait imagery. <br><br>That said, some of the issues that plagued the Xiaomi 14 Ultra are present on the 15 Ultra as well. As good as the cameras are on the phone, they can be inconsistent, particularly when shooting HDR images. Xiaomi addressed this to an extent by rolling out software updates on the 14 Ultra, and it will likely do the same with the 15 Ultra — I'll share an update once that goes live. <br><br>Outside of that and the occasional overheating, I don't have any problems with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and while I'm waiting to see what OPPO and Vivo do with their Ultra models, the phone sets a high bar for mobile imaging in 2025.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the Xiaomi 15 Ultra on February 27 in China, with a global launch at Mobile World Congress on March 2. The device will make its way to India, the U.K., and other global markets where Xiaomi has a presence. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is sold in two storage sizes: 16GB/512GB and 16GB/1TB.</p><p>The 15 Ultra is going on sale globally for €1,499, and this is the configuration that comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Xiaomi also has the standard model going on sale, and that model will cost €999 globally.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MQakYKRpp4fnbYTWySVQ87" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MQakYKRpp4fnbYTWySVQ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After years of constantly switching designs of its phones, Xiaomi finally has a semblance of a unified design language — at least on its Ultra models. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra looks nearly identical to its predecessor, and I how the aluminum mid-frame blends seamlessly into the glass back. You still get flat sides, but like last year, the beveled design where the mid-frame meets the back ensures the device isn't uncomfortable to hold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="htrm9nNRiBwPMFxnqFMDs6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra profile view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/htrm9nNRiBwPMFxnqFMDs6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 9.4mm, the 15 Ultra is noticeably thicker than most other 2025 phones — Vivo's X200 Pro and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> are just 8.2mm while featuring even bigger batteries. This was the case last year on the 14 Ultra as well, and if anything, I think the thicker profile makes holding the phone a little easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fByetpotnP9YVpgPMZvQr6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra side view with power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fByetpotnP9YVpgPMZvQr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, the sides have a matte texture, and they don't pick up any smudges. The beveled design along with rounded edges and matte coating combine to create a great in-hand feel, and even though it's on the heavier end of the scale at 226g, Xiaomi nailed the weight distribution — the 15 Ultra doesn't feel unwieldy in the least.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dAe2gvC6UprPM9oaaXDa27" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dAe2gvC6UprPM9oaaXDa27.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design at the back is dominated by the massive camera island, and it looks a little cleaner than last year (which really isn't saying much). The 200MP tele lens sits at the top next to the Leica branding, with the other three modules located below. There isn't a gold accent encircling the island this time, with Xiaomi instead using the same material as the mid-frame. This makes the design of the camera island look cohesive, and even though it's a sizeable unit (it takes up most of the width at the back), there's no wobble when using the phone on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YGE5qYkhExMhcaYv5ES6B7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YGE5qYkhExMhcaYv5ES6B7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi did a good job with the design this year, introducing a distinctive two-tone finish with the leather-backed models that make the 15 Ultra look like classic DSLR cameras. I got the white model with a glass back, and while it doesn't have as much design flair, the color option has a swirling pattern underneath the glass that gives it a little elegance, and the texture makes it great to hold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qTQ8PxL8qsExhKzWBGxjq6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qTQ8PxL8qsExhKzWBGxjq6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside a better design, the 15 Ultra has much better durability. The phone uses Xiaomi's custom glass solution, and it is effective against tumbles. Other than a week of travel where I put the phone in the bundled case (I didn't want to push my luck), I used the 15 Ultra without a case, and it held up incredibly well to the rigors of daily use. In spite of a dozen tumbles in the month I used the phone — two from the dining table — it didn't pick up any visible damage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8kcCF4qD3Cz5FSajha7Ds6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra bottom view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8kcCF4qD3Cz5FSajha7Ds6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the subject of resilience, the 15 Ultra has IP68 ingress protection, and you shouldn't have any issues using the device in the bath or at the pool. While most 2025 phones have IP69 protection in addition to IP68, the 15 Ultra misses out in that area. Still, it isn't an issue in regular use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5fTSiWCKbuz44QSrkwzBs6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra camera island" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fTSiWCKbuz44QSrkwzBs6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons are located on the right, and the textured coating on the power button is intact this year. The positioning of the buttons is ideal, as is the fingerprint sensor — it's located at just the right place to unlock the device even while using it one-handed. On that note, Xiaomi switched to an ultrasonic module this year, and while I'm generally not a fan of these sensors — they're unreliable outside of Vivo and iQOO phones — I didn't have any problems on the device. It is fast to authenticate and doesn't have any issues even when you use the phone with wet fingers.</p>
<p>Overall, the 15 Ultra has one of the best-looking designs of the year, and while it is bulkier and heavier than its immediate rivals, Xiaomi did a great job with the in-hand feel, and it is comfortable to hold and use.</p>

<p>Xiaomi likes using 6.73-inch AMOLED panels on its Ultra devices, and that's been the case starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-12s-ultra-review">12S Ultra</a> back in 2022. The 15 Ultra retains the same size, but the panel gets a little brighter than last year. It still has 120Hz refresh, and goes up to 3200 nits in HDR content, but it's in outdoor use where the device excels — the AMOLED panel gets bright enough that even under harsh sunlight, there are no issues viewing the screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hKipWAH4pfUo3adzUhMc77" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hKipWAH4pfUo3adzUhMc77.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, Xiaomi did a great job calibrating the panel out of the box, and it has vibrant colors and excellent contrast. You have a good amount of customizability when it comes to adjusting the color balance — I used the original colour Pro mode — and you can have the balance change dynamically based on ambient light.</p>
<p>Just like its predecessor, the 15 Ultra handles HDR content really well, delivering saturated colors and good brightness levels. The built-in sound isn't that loud this year — you don't get an identical stereo channel at the top — but it is still decent enough for casual gaming and media playback in general.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZbhkGi5FRmDDCY5qrsuaB7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra home page against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZbhkGi5FRmDDCY5qrsuaB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has one of the best reading modes of any device; Xiaomi lets you set up custom colors or switch to a monochrome mode, and you can schedule it to kick in at a particular time or enable it automatically when you open an app. You get an always-on mode as well, and while Xiaomi's always-on styles aren't quite as extensive as what you get in ColorOS, you get a good selection nonetheless. <br><br>The 15 Ultra uses Xiaomi's custom Shield Glass 2.0 solution, and it is effective at safeguarding the panel against tumbles and scratches. I don't see any visible scratches on the panel after a month of use, and it weathered a dozen tumbles with ease.</p>

<p>Xiaomi is no stranger to delivering a great hardware package, and you get Qualcomm's latest silicon under the hood along with 16GB of RAM and either 512GB or 1TB of the latest UFS 4.1 storage. I'm using the 16GB/512GB model, and I didn't run into any issues in daily use; there's no lag whatsoever, and Xiaomi did a good job optimizing the software. <br><br>The 15 Ultra has much better fluidity than its predecessor, and it makes using the device fun. It handles gaming with relative ease as well, and I got reliable framerates in demanding titles without any noticeable jitter or lag. While Xiaomi is using a bigger vapor chamber this year, overheating continues to be a problem on the 15 Ultra; the device gets hotter than the X200 Pro, and it has the same issues as the Qualcomm-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, the phone got so hot that I wasn't able to run 3DMark's Steel Nomad stress test; the synthetic workload was abandoned at the halfway point, with a message saying the device overheated. This was an issue on last year's 14 Ultra as well, and it's clear that Xiaomi needs to tweak its thermal management. While overheating is a problem in demanding titles, the device didn't exit a game mid-way — that was only during a 3DMark run — and there isn't excessive throttling. <br><br>The rest of the hardware is outstanding; I didn't see any issues with cellular or network connectivity, and calls went through without any problems. The phone gets LHDC in addition to Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive and AptX HD codecs, and it even has Bluetooth 6.0. <br><br>The vibration motor is among the best around, and it delivers granular feedback while using the keyboard or navigating the interface. Qualcomm-based phones in general tend to run hotter than the Dimensity 9400-powered Find X8 Pro and Vivo X200 Pro, and that's true of the 15 Ultra as well; that said, it still does a fantastic job at gaming.</p>

<p>Xiaomi boosted the battery on the 15 Ultra, with the device now featuring a 5410mAh unit. As a result, it lasts considerably longer than its predecessor, and I didn't have to worry about battery anxiety even while traveling. It isn't as good as the X200 Pro in this regard — I'm beginning to think that no device can measure up to Vivo's offering in 2025 — but it does a great job in its own right, and I only had to charge the device every day and a half on average. <br><br>Like its Chinese rivals, the 15 Ultra uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide battery</a> to great effect, and you get better density and longevity. Xiaomi didn't change the charging tech, so the phone has the same 90W fast charging over USB PD as last year, and it even goes up to 80W wirelessly, but I wasn't able to test this particular mode as Xiaomi still doesn't sell the requisite charger outside China. <br><br>You get the usual safeguards, including optimized charging and an 80% charging limit, and it takes just over 50 minutes to charge the unit from flat. Even with heavy use involving several house of navigation and gaming, the phone lasted a day without breaking a sweat, and while it may not be the longest-lasting phone I used in 2025, it comes close.</p>

<p>Xiaomi continues to deliver an outstanding camera package with the 15 Ultra, and at the heart of the imaging system is the 1-inch Sony LYT-900 module. It isn't a variable lens this time and is locked to f/1.63, and it retains OIS. The sensor is similar to what Xiaomi used to great effect last year, and honestly, I'm glad the brand didn't change anything in this area. <br><br>A key differentiator this year is the debut of the 200MP Samsung HP9 module that handles telephoto duties up to 4.3x and beyond, and it is without a doubt the best sensor in this category — Vivo's X200 Pro has the same lens. It's joined by a 50MP Sony IMX858 tele lens, and a 50MP Samsung JN5 wide-angle module. Both tele shooters get OIS as standard, and up front there's a 32MP camera with autofocus. <br><br>The camera interface is unchanged, so I'm not going to talk about it too much. Like last year, you get the ability to shoot 4K60 via all the rear cameras, and the ability to do so from 0.6x to 4.3x is pretty great. You even get 4K120 with the main camera and 200MP lens, and it is a unique advantage that you don't get with any other phone. <br><br>Xiaomi is once again leveraging Leica optics and tuning, and you get two shooting profiles: Leica Authentic and Vibrant. The Authentic mode has a slight vignette and renders accurate details, but I like the tonal balance of the Vibrant mode, so that's what I used.</p>

<p>The wide-angle lens does a great job, and it manages to take detailed shots even in low-light situations. You get a similar color balance as the main camera, and I didn't have any issues taking wide-angle shots. <br><br>A big part of what makes the 15 Ultra great is its ability to take wonderful telephoto shots. The inclusion of two lenses means you get a 3x mode at 70mm focal length and 4.3x at 100mm focal length, with the phone relying on in-sensor zoom via the main camera to deliver 2x shots. Shots at 3x and 4.3x have excellent rendition and detail, and the device manages to take the same caliber of photos in low-light situations as well.</p>

<p>Another bonus is that you get good versatility when it comes to portrait imagery. This is where the Vivo X200 Pro comes into its own, and while the 15 Ultra takes detailed shots, there are issues. I noticed instances where it struggled with background segmentation and dialing in on the subject. <br><br>In the photo above of my colleague Derrek Lee, it took several tries to get a natural background blur without any artifacts, and even then it didn't retain focus on the phones held in his hands. This isn't an issue on the X200 Pro or Find X8 Pro, so Xiaomi needs to dial in some of the problems with portraits.</p>

<p>There are inconsistencies with HDR, with noticeable blooming at times. These problems should be straightforward to address with software updates, and I'll revisit this section in a month to see if the issues are sorted out. Clearly, the hardware is among the best of any phone available today, and Xiaomi just needs to dial in the tuning a little bit to make the device reach its potential.<br><br>Don't get me wrong; the 15 Ultra delivers terrific photos in just about any scenario — it's just that having used the X100 Ultra and the X200 Pro, I know what the underlying hardware is able to achieve. But even as things stand, the 15 Ultra does enough to measure up against the X200 Pro, and it easily outshines the Galaxy S25 Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-xiaomi-15-ultra-software"><span>Xiaomi 15 Ultra: Software</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cmwyZWWPWKGBQQXjjJVNC7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra Android 15 Easter egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cmwyZWWPWKGBQQXjjJVNC7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Xiaomi 15 Ultra comes with the latest iteration of the brand's software, and it is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. While there isn't any visual difference, the UI has much better optimization, and this is immediately evident when using the phone. <br><br>As is the case with every new Xiaomi phone, the software has its share of quirks. I got notification alerts even after enabling DND, so I had to manually decrease notification volume to not get constantly distracted by the device. Push notifications haven't been an issue (thankfully), but Xiaomi still doesn't do a good job with floating notifications, and I had to routinely pull down the shade to see incoming one-time codes and messages.</p>
<p>Like all other phone brands, Xiaomi is baking AI features into its software, and that includes the usual image editing tools like object eraser and the ability to remove reflections in photos. Both features are decent in their own right, but I still think ColorOS has the edge in this regard. The only AI-backed utility that I like is the built-in transcribing feature in the Recorder. It did a good job transcribing audio on the fly, and I intend to use it extensively at MWC. <br><br>Other than that, there isn't much else to talk about with the software. Xiaomi is clearly in need of an overhaul, and while you get a decent amount of customizability, the UI as a whole doesn't look as clean as ColorOS or even Funtouch OS. <br><br>When it comes to updates, the 15 Ultra will get four guaranteed Android OS updates alongside five years of security updates, and that's in line with what Xiaomi delivers on all of its high-end phones. Xiaomi at at the bottom of the list when it comes to rolling out platform updates, and that's something the brand needs to address.</p>

<p>I still think Vivo is doing a better job when it comes to tuning the cameras on its devices, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> doesn't have a 1-inch sensor, it manages to take fantastic photos and videos. It has the same 200MP tele lens, and I got outstanding portrait shots with the device — so much so that I used it instead of my mirrorless. I'm interesting in seeing what Vivo is able to deliver this year with the X200 Ultra, but outside of that device, I don't think there's anything else that has the ability to go up against the Xiaomi 15 Ultra's camera might. <br><br>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> is a good alternative to consider, and unlike the X200 Pro, it is available in the U.K. and other western markets. It has a clean design, a vibrant AMOLED, great battery life, and the quartet of 50MP cameras at the back takes excellent photos and videos. <br><br>In a similar vein, Honor's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a> combines great cameras with high-end internals. Honor leads the industry with its eye-comfort tech, and while the cameras on the device aren't quite as good as the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, they have clear advantages when shooting photos of moving objects and AI-assisted rendering.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-xiaomi-15-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>Xiaomi 15 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2gXUs4P77BsqjcoXKbEmC7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2gXUs4P77BsqjcoXKbEmC7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the latest internals and good gaming potential</li><li>You need one of the best camera packages around</li><li>You want reliable battery life and fast charging</li><li>You need a phone with a standout design</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want timely software updates and a clean UI</li><li>You want a phone that doesn't heat up too much</li></ul>
<p>The 15 Ultra solidifies Xiaomi's position in the flagship category. The phone doesn't differ too much to its predecessor, but you get a brighter AMOLED panel, better-looking design that's easier to hold and use, and a bigger battery that lasts a day and a half. <br><br>The phone includes a year's worth of tuning upgrades on the camera side of things, and the difference is evident. The introduction of a 200MP tele lens gives it a distinct advantage, and it takes much better portrait shots than last year's model. Image quality is inconsistent at times, and this was an issue on the 14 Ultra as well — that's one of the reasons why I prefer Vivo's tuning these days. Having said that, the 15 Ultra has one of the strongest camera packages, and it takes outstanding photos and videos most of the time. <br><br>Like previous years, Xiaomi's software is the only real limitation on the device; the brand needs to do a better job cleaning up the interface, and deliver new features. Xiaomi has shown that it can optimize its phones just as well as its Chinese rivals, and it now needs to prove that it can do the same with a visual redesign. <br><br>Overall though, the 15 Ultra has been a delight to use. I could have written this review after using the device for just a week, and in spite of its software foibles, I enjoyed using the 15 Ultra so much that I stuck with it throughout the month. The only other phone that impressed me as much this year was the X200 Pro, and just like Vivo's flagship, Xiaomi did a standout job with the 15 Ultra, and it is among my favorite phones of 2025.</p>

It has the same IP68 and 5ATM rating that you'll find in virtually every premium smartwatch, so you can rest assured that it's safe to use around water.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="how-water-resistant-is-the-oneplus-watch-3-2">How water resistant is the OnePlus Watch 3?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xrhfyJ4WfQ3V2nya8pUDj" name="oneplus-watch-3-workout-watch-face-with-shoes-02" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with a fitness watch face on a pair of workout shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xrhfyJ4WfQ3V2nya8pUDj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a> boasts both an IP68 and 5ATM rating. The IP68 rating means that it is water-resistant in fresh water sources up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. This also pertains to its resistance against dust. This means you can take a dip in the pool or soak in the tub without having to remove the watch.</p><p>The 5ATM rating, meanwhile, pertains to water pressure, confirming that the OnePlus Watch 3 can withstand water pressure up to a depth of about 50 meters, with “ATM” standing for “atmospheres.” Thus, you have further reassurance that it’s safe to swim with the device. However, it isn’t meant for deep diving or high-impact water sports.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 does, however, meet MIL-STD-810H durability standards as well, which means it can also withstand low pressure/altitude, temperatures as high as 158°F and as low as -104°F, temperature shock, solar radiation, humidity and heat, a 96-hour salt spray, vibration, impact, and even freezing rain.</p><p>Among its more than 100 sports modes, in fact, is one specifically for swimming. This mode can track your 100-meter pace, number of laps, distance, number of strikes, and swolf. There’s also a sports mode for skiing that can track speed, drop, slope, number of trips, and full and single trip distance.</p><p>Bottom line: the OnePlus Watch 3, which will overtake the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> on our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-for-battery-life">the best smartwatches for battery life</a>, is about as waterproof as you can get, though the term water-resistant is technically more fitting to use.</p>
<h2 id="where-and-when-to-heed-caution-2">Where and when to heed caution</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2nbcF59iBcEMuPVdBTuTGL" name="oneplus-watch-3-workout-rings-watchface" alt="Checking out my workout rings on a fitness-focused OnePlus Watch 3 watchface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nbcF59iBcEMuPVdBTuTGL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As with any water-resistant device that meets these same two ratings, you still need to heed some caution. For example, you might want to steer clear of the saltwater ocean, since saltwater can corrode electronic components in the watch, or any electronic device, for that matter.</p><p>Pools with chlorine should be fine, but if you’re in a pool with heavy chlorination, like at a community center or indoor kids’ waterpark, you might feel safer removing the watch as a precaution. You may want to do the same for spots like hot tubs and jacuzzis. While the rating suggests it can withstand these high temperatures, it’s always best to proceed with caution.</p><p>Always wipe the watch down after or rinse it off and wipe dry if you get sand on it at the beach, for example. And note that not every third-party band you might find for the OnePlus Watch 3 down the line will be water-resistant, or ideal to use in water. Try to stick to silicone wrist straps when submerging it in water: the ones that it comes with are fine for this.</p><p>Finally, note that water resistance degrades over time with any electronic device. So, while the watch might function beautifully for the first year or so, you’ll want to take extra care as it ages. This isn’t to say it’s no longer water-resistant. But things like cracks, scuffs, and scratches could impact the rating over time.</p>

It's packed full of neat features, including RCS chats and Gemini integration. However, it's the simple things that can really improve your time using Google Messages. One of those simple, handy features in Google Messages you may not have known about is auto-deletion for one-time passwords (OTPs).</p><p>No matter how many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-password-manager-passkeys-cross-save-sync">passkeys</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-authenticator-security-material-you-redesign">authentication apps</a> you use, chances are, you still run into two-factor authentication codes often. Those are the usually four or six-digit OTPs that help you sign into an online account or service. They're used immediately, but continue to clog up your inbox unless you delete them manually. That is, unless you set up Google Messages to trash them automatically using the steps below.</p>
<h2 id="otps-and-why-you-d-want-to-delete-them-2">OTPs, and why you'd want to delete them</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2998w5QMnSoSCZQYRfwFXJ" name="google-messages-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2998w5QMnSoSCZQYRfwFXJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fact of the matter is, usernames and passwords aren't enough to keep your online accounts secure. That's why many online services <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">require two-factor authentication (2FA) for extra security</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/definitive-ranking-two-factor-authentication-methods">best forms of 2FA</a> include unique QR codes or authentication apps, but the far-and-away most common form of 2FA is SMS authentication. In other words, SMS authentication is when you get a text including a code that will help you log in and verify it's really you.</p><p>That code is otherwise known as a one-time password (OTPs). Despite being incredibly common, there are a few problems with OTPs sent over SMS. Most annoyingly, they clog up your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> conversation list. You can manually delete them like any other text message, but the smarter way is to enable auto-deletion of OTPs in your Google Messages settings.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-automatically-delete-otps-in-google-messages-2">How to automatically delete OTPs in Google Messages</h2>
<p>Google Messages includes a handy setting that deletes your current and future OTPs after 24 hours. Considering most OTPs expire within an hour or less, it's essentially a no-brainer. Here's how to turn it on:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Messages app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong>, then press <strong>Messages settings</strong>.</p><p>3. Find <strong>Message organization</strong>, and tap it.</p><p>4. Tap the toggle beside <strong>Auto-delete OTPs after 24 hours</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MjqqoxQvtmeXZnmcx6Kjqh" name="Google-Messages-Organization" alt="Auto-deletion of OTPs in Google Messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MjqqoxQvtmeXZnmcx6Kjqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After that, your current OTPs that are more than a day old will be deleted immediately, and all future ones will be trashed after 24 hours.</p>
<h2 id="google-messages-is-packed-full-of-features-2">Google Messages is packed full of features</h2>
<p>All it takes is one toggle to make your Google Messages conversation lists a lot cleaner. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gmail-sms-qr-code-swap-confirmed-report">Google wants to move away from SMS verification codes</a>, they're here to stay for a ton of online sites, platforms, and services. That's why Google Messages' auto-deletion of OTPs is incredibly useful, and everyone with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> should consider enabling. It's one of the many features that makes Google Messages the default — and in many ways, the best — SMS app for Android.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-about-the-oneplus-watch-3-s-battery-life-2">What you need to know about the OnePlus Watch 3's battery life</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a> is a good-looking watch with a new coprocessor called the BES2800 for background RTOS tasks. If you're considering the OnePlus Watch 3 as your next wearable, one key factor to know is its battery life.</p><p>OnePlus says it packed the Watch 3 with the manufacturer's Silicon NanoStack battery, which lets OnePlus add a larger battery in a smaller space. It's the same battery technology OnePlus utilized in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>When you need to charge your wearable, a 10-minute charge provides power for a full day thanks to the VOOC fast charging. This is great when you're in a hurry and only need enough power to get through your day. But when you have time for a full charge, OnePlus claims you can get as much as five days on Smart mode, three days with heavy use in Smart mode, and 16 days on Power saver mode. The final number can vary depending on the features and apps used. OnePlus did not release a charging speed increase, but tests suggest it <em>appears</em> it can charge faster regardless of the larger capacity.</p><p>OnePlus puts all this power into a smartwatch that many might consider one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch" target="_blank">best smartwatches</a>. The latest model features a battery with a 131mAh capacity increase from the previous model while also being slightly thinner due to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025" target="_blank">silicon-carbon battery technology</a>. Beyond improving battery efficiency, this technology enhances durability in extreme temperatures while using less space.</p><p>Android Central's Michael Hicks said that in his initial testing, the battery lasted an estimated five days, even with daily workouts. He also said that the Watch 3 is longer-lived than the average smartwatch, and it gives power users who frequently make on-wrist calls, do a lot of GPS workouts, or stream music to Bluetooth earbuds more leeway. The 631mAh battery OnePlus went with makes all of this possible. He also noted that our tester charged the smartwatch from 20% to 100% in only 30 minutes.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 gives you great value for your dollar. It's rugged yet elegant, and in Power Saver mode, the battery can last up to 16 days.</p>

<p>So, you’re looking for a foldable phone. First off, this probably means you have a pretty hefty budget as these don’t come cheap. Second, you’ll want to take extra care to ensure you choose the right one after investing so much in it. One of the latest to launch is the OPPO Find N5, and when looking at the OPPO Find N5 vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, this is a big decision. Do you go with the familiar Galaxy world or consider something different? Here’s our comparison to help you decide.</p>
<h2 id="oppo-find-n5-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-the-design-and-basic-features-2">OPPO Find N5 vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: The design and basic features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ajo5PA4uV8xTbDzFTqDVt4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 outer panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ajo5PA4uV8xTbDzFTqDVt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OPPO Find N5, successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> (which was called the OPPO Find N3 in China), comes in black or a pearlescent white, equipped with a volume rocker, power button, and ringer switch. The outer LTPO screen is pretty big, measuring 6.62 inches with 2,480 x 2,248-pixel resolution with 2,100 nits of peak brightness and an adaptive 1-120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Once unfolded, the LTPO screen measures 8.12 inches with 2,616 x 1,140-pixel resolution, 2,450 nits peak brightness, and the same 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate. Along with Dolby Vision and HDR10+, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Harish Jonnalagadda says in this review</a> that the color vibrancy is “among the best of any foldable I’ve used.” But the real showstopper is that it’s incredibly thin at just 8.93mm when folded (a mere 4.21mm unfolded). It’s the world’s thinnest foldable you’ll find on the market today. In fact, Jonnalagadda says it feels like a regular phone most of the time because of his insanely thin it is.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 comes together (and unfolds) with a grippy housing made of Armor Shield. The hinge is a titanium alloy, 3D-printed Flexion hinge that has a reduced crease, which Jonnalagadda says is “barely visible.” He also loves that it allows the phone to lock at any angle between 50 and 150°.</p><p>This is complemented by the shielded aluminum alloy frame and the ultra-thin nanocrystal glass. The inner screen, meanwhile, is made from durable and resilient UTG with dual layers of anti-impact films and a dual-shielded flexible screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p3hjTAU3RjSKM9zDYmCss4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 inner panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3hjTAU3RjSKM9zDYmCss4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Combine this with the IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 water-resistance ratings, and you can be confident that this is a durable phone. It can withstand not only exposure to water but also high-pressure jets!</p><p>Along with the bright, high-resolution screens, you also get eye comfort tone, which helps reduce eye strain, particularly when using the phone in darker settings. There’s also 2,160PMW comfortable dimming for low-light environments, and a bedtime mode that reduces blue light when you need to unwind and are maybe doing one last Instagram scroll before bed.</p><p>Running ColorOS and with 512GB storage, the OPPO Find N5 is equipped with a 5,600mAh OPPO Silicon-carbon battery that affords up to 25 hours of continuous video streaming or 8.6 hours of continuous Zoom meetings. Basically, you’ll get all-day use from the phone; Jonnalagadda says it lasted longer than any other foldable he has tried to date, easily a day even with heavy use. It also supports fast 80W SUPERVOOC wired charging and an impressive 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging with compatible chargers.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 will come with five Android platform updates and six years of security updates, which is less than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 (which gets seven years) but impressive, nonetheless, compared to other brands. The big disappointment with this phone, however, is that there aren’t any plans to bring it to North America.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GF3QPWY4hxvMrmFA36Ljkk" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GF3QPWY4hxvMrmFA36Ljkk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design- and spec-wise, that’s a pretty tall order for Samsung to compete with. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is ultra-thin and light as well, but it’s 5.6mm thin when unfolded, so it’s slightly thicker for those who are taking notes. Available in Silver Shadow, Navy, or Pink (Black or White is exclusive through Samsung), it works with the Samsung S Pen Fold Edition, but it does not come with one in the box.</p><p>In terms of the screens, the outer screen is slightly smaller at 6.3 inches, and it’s a Dynamic AMOLED 2X LTPO that boasts 2,376 x 968 resolution, not nearly as high-res as the OPPO Find N5. The unfolded screen is also smaller at just 7.6 inches. Also a Dynamic AMOLED 2x LTPO, its resolution is 2,160 x 1,856, which falls closer in line with the OPPO model. Both screens afford an adaptive 1-120Hz refresh rate as well. You’ll get up to 2,600 nits peak brightness along with Samsung’s Vision Booster to assist when needed.</p>

<p>Constructed of armor aluminum with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, the phone only has an IP48 rating, which gives it a leg up in terms of protection against dust, but it’s missing those extra water-resistance ratings. Additionally, there’s a PET screen protector on the inner display. The FlexHinge was redesigned with a reinforced folding edge, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Andrew Myrick says in his review</a> that this phone is much easier to open than its predecessor and only shows a subtle crease down the middle.</p><p>Choose from 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB storage for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, which runs the Android 14 OS with One UI 6.1.1. It has a smaller 4,400mAh battery than the OPPO Find N5, but Samsung says it lasts all day, affording up to 77 hours of music playback and 23 hours of video. The phone doesn’t charge as quickly at just 25W wired and 10-15W wireless, but it does support 4.5W reverse wireless charging, useful if you have other Galaxy devices like Samsung Galaxy Buds.</p>

<p>So, you know how these phones compare in terms of the design, screens, durability, and basic specs. Now, let’s dive deeper.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 runs the ColorOS, which is based on Android 15, and comes equipped with a trinity engine and 16GB RAM, more than you’ll find in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. While it uses a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, Jonnalagadda says it runs just as well as non-foldables with the same base processor, for both demanding tasks and gaming. However, he did notice that it lacks the same thermal thresholds so there’s some throttling.</p><p>It has tons of AI goodies to compete with the likes of both the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 as well as other premium smartphones that don’t fold. This includes features like AI Translate, dual-screen interpreter, AI Assistant for documents, AI call summaries, Circle to Search, and, of course, the Google Gemini experience.</p><p>It's uniquely equipped with a 360° surround antenna with an AI driven adaptive antenna system that the company says can adjust the signal based on how you hold the phone. Jonnalagadda says the phone had great connectivity, even better than other phones he has recently tested. He chalks that up to this interesting antenna design that is clearly working.</p><p>There’s also a Mac Remote feature that allows you to use the phone to search, access, edit, and sync files on a Mac remotely once you download the O+ Connect to your Mac computer. You can also enjoy features like split view and boundless view, and leverage security features like theft protection and deletes files encryption.</p>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. Running Android 14 and supporting seven years of OS and security updates through 2031, it also includes the Samsung One UI 6.1.1 that adds further customization to the look and feel of the phone. The foldable is equipped with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy processor and has 12GB RAM along with a Vulkan engine to ensure a smooth gaming experience.</p><p>You get a similarly robust AI experience with Google Gemini and features like dual-screen interpreter that affords the ability to translate conversations on the spot. This even includes phone conversations.</p><p>There are super-fun features in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, like the ability to generate images within the Samsung Notes app using AI and the Sketch to Image feature. Speaking of which, as noted, it also works seamlessly with the Samsung S Pen Fold Edition, though you will need to buy one separately.</p>
<h2 id="oppo-find-n5-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-how-about-the-cameras-2">OPPO Find N5 vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: How about the cameras?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VR8H5qz7bUi9W43EFXXjr4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 back view with camera island" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VR8H5qz7bUi9W43EFXXjr4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the camera experience is tantamount to a premium phone, especially with the additional options you have when using a foldable device. Co-developed with Hasselblad, the OPPO Find N5 has a 50MP HyperTone wide-angle lens with OIS and a triple camera bump on its rear that Jonnalagadda says protrudes quite a bit, which means there’s a bit of wobble when you use it unfolded on a table. The cameras also include a second 50MP Samsung telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS and 8MP wide-angle, as well as an 8MP front camera.</p><p>The camera has features like AI telescope zoom and a telephoto macro camera along with LivePhoto, portrait mode, soft light portrait, new film style, and even the option to add your own personalized watermarks to photos.</p><p>You’ll enjoy plenty of other AI editing features like AI Clarity Enhancer, AI Eraser, AI Unblur, and AI Reflection Remover. A cool option unique to this phone is the FlexForm camera, which makes it easy to take selfies from different angles using the rear cameras, including a quick high-res selfie or waist-level framing.</p><p>Overall, Jonnalagadda says the OPPO Find N5 takes “outstanding” photos in daylight situations with good dynamic range and white balance, and natural colors without too much saturation or aggressive smoothing. He found macros photos turned out well, too, with the wide-angle lens being the weakest of the bunch but still taking decent pics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zUEBcjrcBUJwjP9dX5hD2n" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-13.jpg" alt="Camera open on Galaxy Z Fold 6 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zUEBcjrcBUJwjP9dX5hD2n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 has a 50MP wide-angle camera with 2x optical zoom, 12MP ultra-wide camera, 10MP cover camera, 4MP under display camera, and a 10MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. It’s supported by the ProVisual Engine, designed to ensure low noise and clear resolution when zooming. Leverage Super HDR for more detail as well.</p><p>You get tons of cool photo editing features via AI, including the ability to move, erase, or adjust an image, even fill in the background. There’s portrait studio, instant slo-mo, and a cool sketch-to-image feature with drawing assistance.</p><p>Myrick was disappointed that Samsung relied on the same hardware for its cameras as in previous generations, expecting a much better camera system for such a prestigious phone. With that said, he was able to get some great photos when conditions are good, but he notes that “as soon as a wrench gets thrown, you’re at the mercy of steady hands and steady subjects.”</p><p>Bottom line: while you can still get great photos with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, it doesn’t excel in this department. Myrick still feels Samsung is behind other foldable phone makers when it comes to the cameras.</p>

<p>Now that you’re ready to weigh the OPPO Find N5 vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, it seems the decision is simple. Not only does Jonnalagadda say the OPPO Find N5 is the best foldable phone he has ever used, he actually calls it one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> you can buy right now, period. But there’s the rub: <em>can</em> you buy it? The answer is no unless you’re in a country outside of North America that offers it.</p><p>If you are, the OPPO Find N5 excels in virtually every department a good phone should and, most importantly, a good foldable phone. When the only negative things to complain about include that it only comes in two colors and has one storage option, that’s saying a lot.</p><p>However, if you’re in North America and can’t get your hands on this device, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a viable alternative. It’s still a solid foldable phone that introduces you to foldables, keeps you within the Samsung Galaxy ecosystem if that’s what you’re familiar with already, and excels when it comes to all the great AI goodies you could possibly want. But it’s not the better phone.</p><p>If you’re in North America and want to stick with something similar to the OPPO Find N5 that you <em>can</em> buy, look into the OnePlus Open (called the OPPO Find N3 in China). It blew us away, and while the OPPO Find N5 is a step-up in many respects, the OnePlus Open is still one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a> available right now.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is launching the Galaxy A56 5G for $500 later this year, packing an Exynos 1580 chipset.</li><li>The Samsung Galaxy A36 5G and Galaxy A26 5G will hit shelves this month for $400 and $300.</li><li>All three phones will get "Awesome Intelligence," a suite of select AI features coming to the A-series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-the-existence-of-the-unreleased-galaxy-a56-a36-and-a26">a few hot weeks of leaks</a>, Samsung is officially announcing the Galaxy A26 5G, Galaxy A36 5G, and Galaxy A56 5G today, March 1. Notably, the Samsung Galaxy A56 5G will be available "later this year" at a $499.99 price point. Meanwhile, the just-announced Galaxy A36 5G and Galaxy A26 5G will be available starting March 26 and March 28, respectively.</p><p>Aside from hardware upgrades, all three A-series phones are debuting with major software improvements. For starters, the Galaxy A26 5G, Galaxy A36 5G, and Galaxy A56 5G will all ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, which is based on Android 15. From there, these phones will get six years of full OS upgrades, which is a first in Samsung's budget lineup.</p><p>The company is also debuting what it calls "Awesome Intelligence," a pared-down version of Galaxy AI that includes the essentials — including features like Best Face on the Galaxy A56 5G, and enhanced Object Eraser and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> on all models.</p><p>There's also a new "Filters" feature that mimics Apple's successful Photographic Styles tool, adding "custom filter creation by extracting colors and styles from existing photos for users to apply for a unique and personalized effect depending on mood and taste."</p><p>Samsung didn't bring the Galaxy A55 5G to the U.S. last year, and the Galaxy A56 5G could receive the same fate. If it does arrive in the U.S., it'll immediately compete with the pricier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> and the rumored Google Pixel 9a at the $500 price point. With a 5,000mAh battery, an Exynos 1580 chipset, and 8GB of memory, the Galaxy A56 5G could give those other phones a run for their money. On the back, you get a triple-camera system with a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 5MP macro camera.</p><p>The next step down in the A-series lineup is the Galaxy A36 5G, which nets you the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 mobile platform for the processor. That's paired with 6GB of memory and a 5,000mAh battery. In terms of cameras, you get a 50MP main sensor, an 8MP ultrawide camera, and a 5MP macro lens on the back. This phone is priced at $399.99 and comes in three colorways: Awesome Black, Awesome Lavender, and Awesome Lime (Best Buy exclusive).</p><p>The cheapest A-series phone, not including the already-released Galaxy A16 5G, is the new Galaxy A26 5G. It costs $299.99, and it's only available in black. This smartphone has a 50MP main camera, an 8MP ultrawide lens, and a 2MP macro camera.</p><p>Samsung's refresh of the A-series lineup also brings some consistency to the Galaxy A26 5G, Galaxy A36 5G, and Galaxy A56 5G. They all feature 5,000mAh batteries, 128GB of storage, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">IP67 dust and water resistance</a>. This year, the Galaxy A36 5G and the Galaxy A56 5G all have bigger screens. All three phones use a 6.7-inch AMOLED display panel with 120Hz refresh rate support.</p><p>You can buy the Galaxy A36 5G and Galaxy A26 5G starting later this month, and there's no timetable for the Galaxy A56 5G's availability yet.</p>

With Meta fully targeting the low end with budget hardware and free-to-play games, I'm relieved that at least three XR companies are swooping in to keep VR power users happy in 2025.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1894636466480771136">Gabe Follower</a>, several people "have confirmed" Deckard will arrive "by the end of 2025," running the same SteamOS as Steam Deck and priced at a whopping $1,200 for the full bundle with "in-house games" — and it'll still "be sold at a loss" despite that price.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Several people have confirmed that Valve is aiming to release new standalone, wireless VR headset (codename Deckard) by the end of 2025. The current price for the full bundle is set to be $1200. Including some "in-house" games (or demos) that are already done. Valve want to give… pic.twitter.com/alHzQuwNvc<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1894636466480771136">February 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>

<p>Unlike Valve Index, its long-awaited successor will be wireless and won't require a separate PC to play games. Valve clearly recognized the mass appeal of wireless, standalone Quest headsets and the recent popularity of portable PCs like Steam Deck when designing Deckard.</p><p>The key difference from Quest is that Meta makes strategic design cutbacks to target the lowest possible price point for mass appeal, while Deckard isn't holding anything back, with a price that reflects that philosophy. Does that make Deckard irrelevant?</p><p>Former Meta CTO John Carmack recently trivialized PC VR as a "boutique niche" and downplayed the critically acclaimed Half-Life: Alyx as less "important" than Beat Saber. Right now, mainstream VR fans are flocking to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a> and spending all their time playing Gorilla Tag and Horizon Worlds. Meta itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">pivoted to prioritize free-to-play content</a> because microtransactions make more money than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">high-quality Quest games</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whenever I post something critical of Meta’s handling of VR, there are always some old timers that pile on with “Yeah! More AAA PC VR Games is the way to win!”. To be clear — standalone VR was the biggest win that VR ever had, by a huge margin, and Beat Saber was far more…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1887535966421659731">February 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>So, in that context, you might assume that the ultra-powerful Deckard will be nothing but a PC VR novelty for a tiny ecosystem of vocal fans with too much money. But I'd argue it represents much more than that.</p><p>For starters, even if PC VR sales are much lower than Quest's, that was always in part because of the effort required to get Steam Link working and the extra PC cost. An all-in-one device with native Steam Link — instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/even-the-new-quest-link-software-cant-save-pcvr-for-me">Meta's often-irritating and buggy wireless workaround</a> — will give PC VR the same mainstream appeal as the Meta store. And we could see more VR-2D crossplay with Steam games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/among-us-3d-proves-non-vr-crossplay-should-be-future-of-quest-games">Among Us 3D</a> bridging the gap.</p><p>More importantly, with PSVR 2 flopping and Apple's unclear XR future after the exorbitant Vision Pro, we need more competition in the VR gaming space. Specifically, I think we need a AAA alternative to Quest to remind gamers that VR isn't fully becoming a kiddie metaverse. The "boutique niche" matters, at least to keep developers invested in the space.</p>

<p>Valve Deckard is just <em>one</em> potential Quest "rival" that'll provide a much-needed breath of fresh air for consumers <em>and</em> developers, even if its raw sales can't compete with the eventual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a>.</p><p>Another competitor is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>, Samsung's premium headset powered by Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr#section-what-is-android-xr">Android XR</a> platform, which could cost even more than Deckard. Google and Samsung have assured devs that they want to support VR games on Moohan; even if it's more of a Quest Pro or Vision Pro analog, Samsung's headset should appeal to people who want a better balance of games <em>and</em> apps, as well as a high-res virtual desktop space.</p>

<p>In some ways, I'm most intrigued by the third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta Horizon OS</a> headsets, like the upcoming ASUS ROG VR headset. Meta is sharing its software and gaming library with companies like Lenovo and ASUS, and the latter is specifically making a "performance gaming headset."</p><p>Prominent VR leaker Lunayian claims this headset is codenamed Tarius and that it "will likely be one of the first 3P Horizon OS HMDs to ship." Tarius allegedly has eye and face tracking, as well as advanced displays with either "QD-LCD with local dimming or μOLED."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Details on the upcoming ASUS ROG VR headset running Meta Horizon OS.It is codenamed Tarius, and will likely be one of the first 3P Horizon OS HMDs to ship.It is planned to include Eye Tracking and Face Tracking.

<p>Whether we get micro-OLED on par with the Apple Vision Pro or simply get local dimming like the original Quest Pro offered, it'll be a step up on most Quest headsets, not to mention eye tracking for improved performance via foveated rendering and better avatars for social VR with face tracking.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if this version ends up costing twice as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a>, but it'll feel like a version of Quest that's no longer holding back in terms of performance and cameras. Meta's concept art above seems to suggest the ASUS ROG headset will have an Elite-style strap built in, which any premium headset should have by default. Best of all, your Quest library will carry over to this headset because of Meta Horizon OS.</p><p>We don't <em>know</em> if this headset will arrive in 2025 like Moohan and Deckard, but we have a strong reason to hope!</p>
<hr>
<p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headsets</a> list has been too short and Quest-dominated for a long time. It's not that I dislike Quest, but I believe that competition is desperately needed to keep the VR space fresh and exciting.</p><p>I'm increasingly hopeful that 2025 will be the year that the VR world is shaken up. Aside from Valve Deckard, Samsung Project Moohan, and ASUS ROG Tarius, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-announces-high-end-xr-headset-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro">Sony's productivity headset</a> running Android XR and Lenovo's productivity headset running Meta Horizon OS. The latter two aren't especially exciting to me personally, but I know they'll appeal to folks who couldn't afford the Vision Pro.</p><p>Personally, based on the leaked info above, I'm going to take a long, hard look at my budget to see if I'll be able to afford Deckard later this year.</p>

When I switched jobs and didn't get to carry one around, I went out and bought one.</p><p>It was a device ahead of its time, and I was hooked. When Android came out, I also bought a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.androidcentral.com/forums/t-mobile-g1.5/" target="_blank">T-Mobile G1</a> and carried two phones around for a while because my BlackBerry Curve was just ... better. They weren't built better; they weren't faster or more efficient, and there were no amazing games. However, BlackBerry was the king of communicating with people because of that keyboard.</p>

<p>Android eventually caught up in its own way, and I stopped using my trusty old BlackBerry. I did flirt with the marriage of the two with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-we-know-about-blackberry-priv-android-slider">BlackBerry Priv</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/blackberry-key2-second-opinion">KEY2</a> (such great phones) but had to move on and experience the newer offerings from other companies. That doesn't mean I don't miss that small screen/physical keyboard experience, though, and the new Clicks Keyboard for Android might be the best way to return to what I love.</p><p>Before I go any further, I need to mention that I have a personal relationship with Michael Fisher (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSOpcUkE-is7u7c4AkLgqTw" target="_blank">Mr. Mobile</a>) and Kevin Michaluk (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/crackberrykevin/?hl=en" target="_blank">CrackBerry Kevin</a>), the founders of Clicks. That's not why I want one for my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr,</a> though, and I haven't even asked for an early model, so I have to wait until May.</p><p>This is also not a sponsored post, and I do not roll that way; I would never do business with people I know, no matter how much I want their product.</p><p>This is just Jerry being a fanboy about a new product. I want one because I think it's so damn cool and might let me use my phone the way I love to use my phone. At least, I hope it will.</p>
<p>I'm not a big accessories guy. I know that's a bit strange coming from a person who works at a place that tells you about and recommends the best accessories for your phone. I don't even use a case or a screen protector. If you told me I would be excited about a phone case last week, I would have chuckled. I did think the initial Clicks cases were cool, but they were only made for iPhones, which I never plan on buying.</p><p>That's changed now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/your-favorite-android-phones-are-finally-getting-these-once-iphone-only-nostalgic-cases">Clicks announced</a> it is making them for <del>real phones</del>, such as Android phones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 and 9 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr Plus</a>.

<p>A physical keyboard is a fast way to polarize Android users. There seems to be no middle ground; you either love them or you think they are stupid, clunky, and old-fashioned. That's a great thing because everyone should figure out what they like and don't like. If you haven't guessed already, I'm in the "love them" camp.</p><p>I think it's because of the way I use my phone. To me, my phone is the best way to communicate with the people I care about.

Right now, it's just a way to see the time and the weather because I'm not going to try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">using an app on that small screen</a> with my fingers. I know I can do a lot more, but <em>I </em>can't do a lot more. A keyboard extension can change that, and my Razr may turn into the modern-day equivalent of my BlackBerry Curve, running <em><strong>much</strong></em> better software. And if I need the bigger screen, I can flip that sucker open and do whatever I need to do. Heck, even <em>I</em> play games on my phone sometimes.</p><p>Most of the two billion Android users aren't going to care or be interested in what Clicks is offering, though I hope the company does well enough to offer the case for even more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. That includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> because my wife was a BlackBerry fan too, and she loves her little green Pixel.</p><p>Now I have to play the waiting game until my order ships. I hope it lives up to my unrealistic expectations or at least brings me closer to what I really want.</p>

I've also really enjoyed the camera quality, which is a pretty big improvement over its predecessor. It's not perfect, but I find it's more than adequate for my needs, to the point that I no longer find the need to carry a second smartphone with me just for the camera. However, there's one unique aspect about the Razr Plus camera system I thought I could live with, and I'm now realizing just how limiting it is.</p><p>I'm talking about the decision to go with a secondary telephoto lens instead of a more traditional ultrawide sensor. It's something we don't often see on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>, and I was admittedly very excited that Motorola actually put one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. But after about eight months with the phone, I find that I actually miss having an ultrawide sensor, and I really hope Motorola brings it back with the Razr Plus 2025.</p>

<h2 id="the-galaxy-z-flip-6-got-it-right-2">The Galaxy Z Flip 6 got it right</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3934px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RmXfJtcLokMupehfS4Ltw" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-10.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RmXfJtcLokMupehfS4Ltw.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3934" height="2213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The reason you don't often find a dedicated telephoto sensor on flip phones is likely due to the size constraints. Given Motorola's decision to include a very large cover screen, there's really only so much room for cameras as they already take up precious usable space on the external display. Adding a third lens would likely just not work with Motorola's current design, and so it has to work with the two is has.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a> went with a secondary ultrawide, and while the camera quality from both sensors wasn't great, I appreciated the versatility. Motorola switched things up last year with a 2x optical telephoto sensor, which takes decent photos, and I like that I can zoom in with minimal loss of quality. However, it's when I want to zoom out that I become disappointed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uLCGmMeES929A7PKut7VnF" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Razr-Plus-2023-1.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 next to the Razr Plus 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uLCGmMeES929A7PKut7VnF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 next to the Razr Plus 2023. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> I've tested over the past several years have included an ultrawide sensor, so my muscle memory keeps expecting to be able to zoom out when I want a wider shot. And it keeps not happening. It has made me realize just how often I use the ultrawide camera, which is probably about as much time as I spend zooming in. This is why I think this is the one thing that Samsung got right with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>Samsung's phone retained its dual camera setup with an upgraded 50MP primary sensor and a 12MP ultrawide. It's a fairly standard setup that you can find on the $300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>, but I can't help but feel like Samsung is able to achieve a lot more than Motorola, even with the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera.</p><p>The company claims the phone can capture optical-quality images at 2x zoom, likely due to the updated primary sensor, and I've been pretty impressed with the images the phone is able to capture, even when put side by side with the Razr Plus 2024.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="470" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=e1a28828-f601-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>In the photo above, the differences between the two primary sensors are pretty obvious, as they both have different takes on color science. However, you may also notice that the Razr Plus 2024 has a slightly narrower field of view, which doesn't really help given its lack of an ultrawide camera to get a wider shot.</p><p>Looking at the 2x zoom photo below, you can already see how the color science has shifted a bit on the Razr Plus. However, the Galaxy Z Flip, despite its lack of a dedicated sensor, still manages to retain plenty of detail and less noise, rivaling the quality of the Razr.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="470" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=64fe22cc-f602-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The next photo is where things get interesting. I zoomed in at 4x, which still uses the Razr's 50MP telephoto camera compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6's 50MP primary camera. While both photos appear quite fine, I notice that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 still manages to retain more detail and much cleaner lines than the Razr Plus 2024. There is a bit of a softness to it, which I imagine is due to the effects of the AI upscaling, but the image overall appears much nicer than Razr's image.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="470" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=31314256-f604-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>That said, there are times when the Razr Plus is able to achieve better clarity in an image when zoomed in, highlighting the drawback (if you can call it that) of not having a dedicated telephoto sensor. In the images below, you can still see that the Razr has a slightly narrower field of view, but when zoomed in, the details on the neon sign appear much clearer than on the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>If you look at the "Climate Pledge Arena" sign, you'll notice that the lines in the green letters are much clearer in the Razr images, while the sign is <em>slightly</em> blown out in the Z Flip 6 images, making those lines not as noticeable. It's a small detail and likely a result of the auto HDR on the Razr camera, which the Galaxy Z Flip 6 doesn't appear to utilize. However, the zoomed images also appear a bit sharper overall on the Razr.</p>

<p>Still, this highlights that the Galaxy Z Flip 6, despite not having a telephoto lens, can still hold its own when it comes to zoom. A combination of a newer sensor and tweaks to processing allows the phone to upscale images to a great degree, giving you nearly the same amount of clarity you'd get from a phone with a dedicated telephoto camera.</p><p>That is, of course, in addition to the secondary ultrawide camera, which gives you the option to take more dramatic shots of landscapes and scenery, which would otherwise be very difficult for the Razr Plus 2024 without physically moving to capture more of a scene.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="TAQdrkbmNPuKCHLQ8SPaFL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-ultrawide-camera-sample" alt="A building with a blue and yellow sunset sky" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TAQdrkbmNPuKCHLQ8SPaFL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, you can always simulate an ultrawide camera to some extent by using the panorama mode on the Razr Plus, but the effect takes more effort and time, and the result isn't really the same as what you would get.</p><p>Not everyone agrees that ultrawide cameras are the way to go, as highlighted by this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/18y63lc/anyone_that_prefers_the_ultrawide_camera_over_a/">Reddit thread</a>. There are plenty of people who prefer telephoto lenses, preferably if they go beyond 2x optical zoom, such as what you'd find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. That said, if a camera is limited to 2x optical zoom, it seems almost superfluous to have a dedicated sensor when you could just rely on the primary sensor and then save the secondary camera for an ultrawide.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DkeQJcsU43BapDyQvjQyWA" name="Motorola Razr Plus 2025" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2025 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DkeQJcsU43BapDyQvjQyWA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A leaked image of the Razr Plus 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AndroidHeadlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There have been a few leaks of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr Plus 2025</a> already and the phone doesn't look to have too many differences from its predecessor. Based on the leaks, it will still sport a large 4-inch cover screen with two rear cameras, although we don't know what those cameras will be or what upgrades Motorola has planned.</p><p>The company isn't known for having the most powerful or reliable cameras, but the Razr Plus 2024 shows that the company has the capacity to improve while also trying something new. When I asked last year about the decision to switch to a telephoto camera, Allison Yi, Motorola's executive director of Product Portfolio, explained that it was about the stats and a way to enhance the experience around content creators and bring the focus on people.</p><p>"It was a very big debate," Yi told me during the interview. "But from our perspective, it's all about the consumer. What do they want? What do they use? What is the most beneficial to them?" She explained that users opt to use telephoto lenses up to 5x more than they use ultrawide cameras.</p><p>That makes sense, but it doesn't fully explain the decision to then stick with an ultrawide sensor on the lower-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>. Sure, the cameras aren't as good, but the added versatility is always nice to have.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4752px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oy6csgRftfn4QqXbexjBxP" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-camcorder-mode-lifestyle.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oy6csgRftfn4QqXbexjBxP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4752" height="2673" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, I can't help but wonder if Motorola would be better off switching back to an ultrawide camera on the Razr Plus 2025 while highlighting a 2x optical zoom equivalent from the primary sensor, the way Samsung does. On the one hand, it would help with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-stealing-away-iphone-users">transition to a Razr from an iPhone</a>, many of which come with the ultrawide sensor. The base iPhone 16, for example, touts "2x optical zoom in" despite only having a wide and ultrawide sensor. The Razr, by comparison, would feel a bit limited to someone switching over.</p><p>But the most obvious reason the Razr Plus needs an ultrawide camera is that they're simply a great way to get more into a shot, letting users capture group selfies or get creative with action shots.</p><p>One day, I would love to see more flip phones with triple camera systems and dedicated telephoto sensors, but for now, we can get the best of both worlds with a standard wide and ultrawide setup.</p>

If you continue to be unresponsive, it will attempt to call 911 and send an automated message with your location to the emergency responder.</p><p>While this feature isn't new on the wearable, since it is already integrated into the Watch 3 in 14 countries in the EU and UK, it is now that users in the U.S. will finally have access to it.</p><p>The rollout of the "loss of pulse detection" is said to happen this month; however, this will only be limited to the Pixel Watch 3, and older generations will not see this feature.</p>

That said, Google has already offered extended software support since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a>, offering 7 years of updates with its newer Tensor chipsets, and Samsung offers the same software update promise with its latest phones, including the Galaxy S25 series.

The triple array also features quite a hefty camera bump, but it's still surrounded by a few of the company's signature Glyph lighting.</p><p>In a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-essential-key-ai-suite-leaked">rumor</a>,  tipster Shivam Kumar claims that a new action button on the Phone 3a will launch a whole host of things that are part of an AI suite called "Essential Spaces."</p><p>That said, our speculations will be soon put to rest as the Nothing is set to launch both these flagship models on March 4.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where there were no subway service interruptions due to scheduled or unexpected repairs on the rail tracks. This is exactly what the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Google are hoping to achieve in the future with their pilot program.</p><p>Google and the New York Subway took part in an experiment that involved sticking pixel phones on the inside of subway cars as well as underneath them (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-new-york-city-subway-is-using-google-pixels-to-sense-track-defects/">Wired</a>).</p><p>This experiment was conducted between September 2024 and January 2025 on four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/tag/new-york-city/">New York City</a> subway cars by Google's Public Sector division, with trains shuttled between Manhattan and the south of Queens. The aim was to see if phones could possibly replace or lower the need for human-led inspection along roughly 665 miles of New York City’s subway.</p><p>The publication added that the subway operators were equipped with "accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes" along with the Google Pixels. At the same time, the ones attached on the outside had additional microphones to go with them. Usually, all this keen listening and observing is done manually by inspectors.</p><p>Google seemed to be working on a special tech that would equip standard Pixel phones to perform more complex tasks like the above. Dubbed TrackInspect, this is set up to capture sound and vibration data, which is sent to a cloud-based system. These systems have AI capabilities that will then use this data to predict subway track defects.</p><p>Breaking it down, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-and-google-public-sector-announce-preventive-track-maintenance-pilot-program">the MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority)</a> states that the prototype "sends a soundbite or noise clip showing heavy vibration or noise, and then our inspectors follow up by walking the track and verifying any issue found."</p><p>The results of this experiment seemed to be extremely insightful. According to Brent Mitchell, Google's Public Sector vice president, 92% of the defects spotted by the TrackInspect program were similar to those tracked by human-led inspections. MTA stated that throughout this experiment, TrackInspect collected 335 million sensor readings, one million GPS locations, and 1,200 hours of audio, which was later ingested into a machine-learning model running on Google Cloud.</p><p>With this initiative, the MTA wants to look at possible ways of conducting safer inspections of miles-long subway tracks in the future, also fixing track issues faster without much disruption to their services. It is always great when technology carefully monitored by humans works its magic, making things more cost-effective and efficient while paving the way for other industries to consider this route as well.</p><p>While we don't know which generation of Pixels were used in this experiment, Android Central has reached out to Google for more insights about the equipment used and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung previewed what was on the way for the Galaxy Buds 3 series in One UI 7.</li><li>The company states users will find a more “intelligent” audio experience as the Buds “analyze” your surroundings to optimize your listening.</li><li>Samsung did not state when One UI 7 could arrive, especially after its phones were hit with yet another major delay.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>To end the week, Samsung showcased a few of the new features on the way for its Galaxy Buds 3 series with the next major One UI update.</p><p>In a press release, Samsung states its One UI 7 update for the Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro is designed to provide the best “audio experience” for users. Additionally, the company is interested in making its audio more “intelligent.” To achieve this, the post highlights its first new feature: Tailor Sound. This concerns personal hearing needs with the company stating it has updated its Adapt Sound tool with an expansion of ambient sound capabilities.</p><p>Samsung says this should make listening to music and the like more accurate and clear when on a video or voice call. It’s worth noting that the Adaptive Sound feature is only available on the Buds 3 Pro.</p><p>In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/galaxy-buds3-series-offers-enhanced-convenience-on-the-galaxy-s25-series">blog post</a>, the company says users will find an “advanced hearing test” to help the software create a personalized sound profile for you. However, if you’d rather not go through the hoops, Samsung will provide three preset profiles from which you can select the best option.</p><p>Next, Samsung introduced its upgraded optimized sound functionality. The post states the mics within the Galaxy Buds 3 series will “analyze” sound externally and internally to optimize what you’re hearing and its ANC capabilities (active noise cancellation). The Adaptive Noise Control is said to gauge your surroundings to automatically alter sound without the user’s input.</p><p>Samsung’s One UI 7 update for the Galaxy Buds 3 series is also bringing a few QoL (quality of life) updates. The first concerns personalizing the audio for specific apps. With One UI 7, users will be able to set their preferred audio settings for individual apps via the Quick Settings Panel. The Korean OEM says these altered settings will be applied automatically and put to use whenever the app you’ve altered is opened.</p><p>The Quick Settings Panel on your Galaxy phone is also gaining access to the Galaxy Wearables app. Samsung states from there, users can alter their wearable settings from their phone without needing to access the app separately. Lastly, the One UI 7 update brings additional interpretation aid via Galaxy AI. Through Listening Mode, your Galaxy Buds will pick up support for 20 extra languages for translations during conversations with users with a different native tongue.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Samsung still hasn’t given us an idea of when we can expect One UI 7 to roll out — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">on smartphones, that is</a>. The major OS has received its lumps for the past few months and it was reported that another delay was in the cards. Reports flooded in regarding Samsung’s “Natural” mode screen optimization feature. According to users, it was causing the screen to become far yellower than intended.</p><p>Samsung was forced to take back its patch and work to fix it. That forecast came true a few weeks later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">when One UI 7 Beta 5 arrived</a> in mid-February. That update came swiftly after its fourth beta hit just days before. Regardless, the fifth update features even more fixes and a solution to a crash bug plaguing the Visual Voicemail app.</p><p><br>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">stated in a blog post</a> that One UI 7 was coming “imminently.” This post was published in mid-January. The company said the update would arrive on Galaxy devices sometime during Q1 2025, which leaves only March.</p>

<ul><li>Google recently published a dedicated “Devices” page for consumers, letting them view every product they own from the OEM.</li><li>The page gives users insight into their device names, serial/IMEI numbers, and access to support for products they’ve “signed in to.”</li><li>Access to Find My Device network for phones was also spotted, giving users full access to location, locking, and sound capabilities for Pixels.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly rolled out a QoL update via its online store, letting consumers see insights about every owned product.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/27/google-store-devices-page/#more-663278">9to5Google</a>, the company recently published a new dedicated “Devices” page on the Google Store for products consumers own. The page states users can “manage” all “Made by Google hardware in one place.” By default, the page displays all of your owned devices; however, there are several tabs in case users can specifically see their phones, earbuds, tablets, watches & trackers, and smart home products.</p><p>When viewing your devices, the page will display them with the appropriate product picture (and selected color) alongside its name. If you’ve named your device, your custom name will show instead of Google’s name for the product.</p><p>The page also details information about your warranty and the date for when/if it already expired.</p><p>Users can view their device’s SN (serial number) or IMEI number if it’s a phone, as noted by the publication. The cards feature a “View More” button, which brings you a device-specific page. This lists similar details as the hard with the addition of when you purchased it. Users can quickly access Google Support from there about the device in question.</p><p>Google has included an “Add a device” option. The company states devices you’ve “signed into” — which are those tied directly to your account — will automatically appear on this new page. However, users can manually add “other devices to manage, but they may have limited functionality.” To do this, users will need that other product’s IMEI or serial number. If this is something you require, Google suggests <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/15938919?visit_id=01740768021397-8122275873028872310&p=your_devices&rd=1">checking out its support page</a> for more details.</p><p>As a side note, the publication noticed users could utilize Google’s Find My Device network when viewing a phone from the Device pages. It seems the page gives users the full Find My Device experience, meaning you can find, lock, or force your lost phone to make a chime.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">started rolling out</a> the Find My Device network for Android devices in the spring of 2024. The service was starting to appear on more devices for those in the U.S. and out on phones like the Pixel 8 and the Moto Razr Plus. One of the standouts of the feature was exclusive to the Pixel 8 series: the ability to locate the phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-find-my-device-powered-off">even when powered off</a>. Users were encouraged to toggle their Bluetooth and location services on before their phone lost power or was turned off.</p><p>Your powered-off Pixel would still transmit its location for “several hours.” As expected, the Pixel 9 series has retained this offline relocation capability through Find My Device.</p>

<ul><li>Google has leased a 7,000-square-foot location in Washington, D.C. that will become a Google Store later this year.</li><li>It'll be the eighth Google Store in the U.S., and the first in the nation's capitol.</li><li>There are three other Google Stores in the works, with a Santa Monica location set to open March 7.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Compared to Apple or Samsung, Google's retail footprint for its Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit devices is relatively small. While the company's products are available in a wide variety of third-party stores, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-to-expand-retail-footprint-with-austin-texas-store-on-the-way">only a handful of Google Store locations</a> in the U.S. Google has been improving on that in recent years, and a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.costar.com/article/31146599/google-search-leads-to-its-first-brick-and-mortar-store-in-dc-area" target="_blank">CoStar</a> , a real estate publication, says that the company's eighth store will be opening in Washington, D.C. this year.</p><p>The news comes from EastBanc, a commercial real estate developer that owns the approximately 7,000 square feet of space that Google picked for its next Google Store location.  The store, which will be located at 3235 M St. NW in the Georgetown neighborhood of D.C., is part of a 10-year lease, according to the report.</p><p>There are currently five Google Stores open for business, and they're concentrated in New York and California. The company also operates stores in Massachusetts and Illinois, which opened in 2024. Google was on track to open two stores in 2025, with those locations being previously announced. Now, the Washington, D.C. store is set to be Google's third retail location in the pipeline. It could open three Google Stores this year, bringing its nationwide total to eight, assuming there are no hiccups.</p>

<p>Google Store locations give potential customers the opportunity to learn more about Google's hardware offerings, with some hands-on elements. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel</a>, Nest, and Fitbit brands are just a few that typically have a prominent place in a Google Store. The company also offers repair and support options, which are crucial if it wants to seriously compete with Samsung and Apple's expansive retail and support networks.</p><p>Aside from the newly-reported Washington, D.C. location, there are Google Store locations planned for Santa Monica, California and Austin, Texas. The retail spot in Santa Monica is set to open March 7, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/locations?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Google's website</a>. Currently, all we know about the Austin store is that it'll be part of the Domain Northside retail hub, located at 11701 Domain Blvd.</p><p>Google is ramping up Google Store developments after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-nyc-store-first-look">opening the first one in Chelsea in 2021</a>.</p>

<p>While it's always exciting to compare the most expensive flagship phones, the midrange sector is arguably more competitive than ever. Apple's newest iPhone 16e is effectively a successor to the third-generation iPhone SE, and it tries to offer a pared-down iPhone 16 experience at the $600 price point. That makes it a fitting competitor to Google's Pixel 8a, a midrange Android smartphone available for $500 with plenty of powerful AI features.</p><p>There are a few reasons to consider avoiding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, but they all involve buying another midrange Android phone. The phone's successor, the Pixel 9a, is almost certainly set to arrive next month — and current Android midrangers like the OnePlus 13R could be a better value. But how does the Pixel 8a shake up when put directly against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16e-just-beat-google-and-samsung-to-the-punch">iPhone 16e</a>? That's what we're here to find out.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-iphone-16e-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. iPhone 16e: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iYiFZ2kfrjYSPRaxDjuh6B" name="google-pixel-8a-homescreen-04.jpg" alt="The colorful home screen of the Google Pixel 8a under some flowers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iYiFZ2kfrjYSPRaxDjuh6B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google and Apple took similar approaches in designing the Pixel 8a and the iPhone 16e. They're both closely related to past Pixel or iPhone flagships, while lacking some of the newer design choices or premium materials found on the latest models. Both phones are also slightly smaller than their flagship companions. The Pixel 8a has a 6.1-inch screen, smaller than the 6.2-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16e also has a 6.1-inch screen, and that's smaller than the 6.12-inch iPhone 16.</p><p>The small form factor may be ideal for people who enjoy compact flagships. In that respect, the iPhone 16e is the smaller choice, measuring 146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.80mm. By comparison, the Pixel 8a is bigger by every measurement, but its thickness is something specifically worth watching out for. Google's midranger measures 152.1 mm x 72.7 mm x 8.9 mm — that's over a millimeter thicker than the iPhone 16e.</p><p>Apple's midranger is considerably lighter, too, weighing just 167 grams. That makes the 188-gram Pixel 8a feel like a giant. This is especially odd when you consider that the Pixel has a plastic back and the iPhone has a glass back. In terms of design and build, the Pixel does have the advantage of comfort. Its curvy, pebble-shaped build conforms nicely to your hand without issue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AHGz9BYP7932QkqQcEJJaE" name="iphone-16e-side-view-render" alt="iPhone 16e side profile render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHGz9BYP7932QkqQcEJJaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1120" height="630" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moving to the displays, the Google Pixel 8a has the definitive edge. It has a 6.1-inch AMOLED panel with support for HDR10+ color and a 1,400-nit peak brightness rating. That's better in every way than the iPhone 16e's display, which has an OLED panel but only supports 60Hz refresh rate and a 1,200-nit peak brightness rating. Additionally, the iPhone 16e has a big notch at the top of the screen, whereas the Pixel 8a has a small hole-punch cutout.</p><p>In terms of durability, both phones are rated for IP68 dust and water-resistance. Google uses Gorilla Glass 3 on the front, while Apple is using its own Ceramic Shield glass. Both devices feature an aluminum construction and a USB-C port for connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6tcayRk63cRY9xtVSBnnQQ" name="google-pixel-8a-blue-with-flowers-01.jpg" alt="The blue Google Pixel 8a on a tea tray with blue hydrangeas above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6tcayRk63cRY9xtVSBnnQQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That about sums up the design differences between the Pixel 8a and the iPhone 16e. The former might have slightly larger display bezels than the latter, but that won't matter since the iPhone 16e has that big notch anyway. The iPhone 16e has the edge in compactness and weight, but the Pixel 8a gets the display win.</p>

<p>Midrange phones usually come with a few compromises, with the processor often being one of them. That's true of the Google Pixel 8a and the iPhone 16e. Both phones are incredibly capable, supporting Google AI and Apple Intelligence respectively, but they won't stack up to flagship-level chips. Google uses the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3 chip</a> here as the rest of the Pixel 8 series. At first glance, it might look like Apple uses the same A18 chip as the iPhone 16, but the iPhone 16e actually has a binned version of the chip with one fewer graphics core.</p><p>What does that all mean? In simple terms, it means that neither midrange phone will be able to hang with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. But you probably already could've guessed that from their prices. The important part is that both phones support their respective AI suites, Gemini Nano on-device and Apple Intelligence (with Visual Intelligence via the Action button).</p>

<p>Google likely offers the edge in software support, as the Pixel 8a is guaranteed seven years of OS updates. It's already gotten the boost to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and has been upgraded with new Circle to Search and Gemini features. Of course, it's not guaranteed to get every new feature, but the Pixel 8a has a solid foundation.</p><p>While Apple has a good <em>reputation</em> for software support, it doesn't provide a <em>guarantee</em>. Additionally, even the year-old iPhone 15 didn't get Apple Intelligence, so it's unclear how Apple's software support could be affected by the fast-moving pace of AI progress.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5C2GJycwViaKNcc7kiCKMJ" name="google-pixel-8a-camera-bar-bay-02.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8a in the Bay blue colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5C2GJycwViaKNcc7kiCKMJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Neither the Google Pixel 8a or the iPhone 16e have the best camera system on a smartphone, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a appears to be closest to flagship-caliber</a>. Google's using a 64MP main camera sensor with an f/1.89 aperture and optical-image stabilization. With sensor crop, it can provide 2x optical zoom quality, with digital zoom beyond that. There's also a secondary 13MP ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view to round out the dual-camera system.</p><p>That's one more camera when than the iPhone 16e has. Apple tries to use one camera sensor that's versatile enough to serve as a main, ultrawide, and telephoto lens. It's a 48MP, f/1.6 lens with OIS capable of shooting either 24MP or 48MP photos. Like the Pixel 8a, it uses sensor crop to mimic a 2x telephoto. Make no mistake, though: while this single camera is likely impressive, it won't match the performance of a good dual or triple-camera system.</p><p>On the front, the Pixel 8a uses a wide 13MP, f/2.2 sensor. By comparison, the iPhone 16e has a 12MP camera with an f/1.9 aperture. Both front-facing cameras will get the job done. In terms of security, the Pixel 8a has both a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-ultrasonic-fingerprint-sensors-just-dont-work-for-me">fingerprint sensor</a> and facial recognition, whereas the iPhone only has Face ID.</p>

<p>After breaking down the specs between the iPhone 16e and the Google Pixel 8a, it's clear that the latter provides more for $500 than the former does for $600. However, I still wouldn't recommend buying the Pixel 8a at its full MSRP — considering it's nearly a year old and the Pixel 9a is on the way.</p><p>Instead, look to buy the Pixel 8a for even cheaper than its $500 sticker price, which will make it that much better of a value than the iPhone 16e. Right now, the Pixel 8a is $100 off when you activate it with a carrier at Best Buy. The deals will almost certainly get better after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> is released, so waiting a few weeks to see what's new could be a solid plan.</p><p>The iPhone 16e's value proposition is tricky, making it difficult to recommend for anyone except those who absolutely <em>must</em> have an iPhone on a sub-$600 budget. Even then, I'd argue that it's worth looking into an older — perhaps even refurbished or renewed — flagship iPhone instead.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>For the iOS lovers out there</strong></em></p><p>It's somewhat difficult to recommend the iPhone 16e to buyers, unless you only have $600 to spend and really want an iPhone. Otherwise, the iPhone 16e's limitations — including the 60Hz, notched display and the lack of MagSafe — loom large. It's better than the iPhone SE it replaces in the iPhone lineup, but gets crushed by $600 Android phones. </p></p>

<hr>
<p>TECNO is firing up the teaser engine once again, but this time the company is showcasing an upcoming, razor-thin smartphone.</p><p>The company<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tecnomobile/status/1895398536558121221"> teased the device on X</a> showcasing what’s coming up at MWC 2025: TECNO’s SPARK Slim. The OEM posted a trio of photos, showing off just how thin the device is. In comparison to a pencil or a CD case, the SPARK Slim is vastly thinner; however, TECNO confirms the phone measures only 5.57mm thick. It remains unclear if this factors in its camera bump, which could take things up a bit.</p><p>Regardless, TECNO continues by highlighting the phone’s “futuristic design.” The silvery phone features rounded corners and relatively flat sides, given how thin the device is said to be. Additionally, TECNO draws attention to its camera housing, which appears to be a dual camera configuration in a pill-shaped bar. It seems very Pixel-esque, especially when you consider the look/feel of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series’ bar</a>.</p><p>TECNO states the SPARK Slim’s dual camera bar will consist of two 50MP lenses. The teaser didn’t expand on what cameras we could see, but perhaps we’re looking at a primary and ultrawide situation.</p><p>Elsewhere, the SPARK Slim is confirmed to have a 6.7-inch 3D Curved AMOLED display. To help you surge through the day will be a 5,200mAh “plus” battery.</p>

A press release detailed TECNO’s work at expanding its Skin Tone Database to accomplish the goal of “true-to-life representation” for a wealth of tones. TECNO is backing its Multi Skin Tone Card with the skin tone restoration engine to ensure all skin tones are “precise” and vibrant, even in challenging photography scenarios.</p><p>The major device prototype we’re waiting on is confirmed to be the Phantom Ultimate 2 tri-fold. TECNO claims the foldable is “ultra-thin” and features a Starry Optical Fiber material. MWC 2025 attendees may have a chance to see this slim foldable on the floor around TECNO’s area.</p><p>Interestingly, TECNO originally teased a super thin Phantom Ultimate 2 tri-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">back in 2024</a> during that year’s MWC. Consumers didn’t get a chance to see the device up close or behind glass as TECNO only highlighted it in teaser imagery and videos. The original concept material teased a phone with a 6.48-inch cover display and a 10-inch 3K OLED internal screen.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mwc-2025-what-to-expect">MWC 2025</a> is gearing up to run from March 3 through March 6.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google is working to change the SMS code authentication used to sign into a Google account to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gmail-sms-qr-code-swap-confirmed-report">have you scan a QR code</a>. Besides the several severe flaws with this idea, it's still good that Google is trying to make proving who we are a little more streamlined and less nerdy. If it weren't such a pain to do it, more services would offer MFA (multi-factor authentication), and more of us would use it.</p><p>Google's not alone here. Microsoft, Apple, and organizations like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fido-passwordless-security">FIDO Alliance</a> are working on the issue, too. These companies know that it's something that benefits everyone, and it needs to be done in a simple yet effective way.</p>
<p>Before discussing Google's new idea, you need to know what authentication is. I can tell you who I am and that is me providing my <strong>identity</strong>. That will never change and I will always be me even if I change my name. I'm still this person.</p><p>But sometimes I need to prove it and <strong>authenticate</strong> that I am who I say I am because it's super easy for me to lie. You don't want Joe Random to have access to your bank or other online account so proof is mandatory.</p><p>There are three types of authentication, and for a service to be secure it needs to use at least two. Using two methods lowers the chance that I'm someone else just trying to get into Jerry's account.</p><p><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Something only the real Jerry would know, like a password or a PIN.<br><strong>Ownership:</strong> Something only the real Jerry has, like an ID card or a software token on a phone.<br><strong>Inherence:</strong> Something the real Jerry is or does, like supplying a fingerprint or a retina scan.</p><p>You'll always need to use a password or PIN for one type of authentication, but for something to be considered secure, you need to use one of the other two types. That's where things can get messy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3413px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Ki6VkQ9S5YboYwKkaNYP4W" name="google-lens-search-with-camera.JPG" alt="Google Lens Search with your camera function" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ki6VkQ9S5YboYwKkaNYP4W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3413" height="1919" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google thinks it would be better and easier to show you a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-read-qr-code-your-android-phones-camera">QR code</a> you can scan to supply proof of ownership than send you an SMS message. It would definitely be more secure because SMS messages aren't difficult to spoof or "hack" into.</p><p>It also has two potential problems I can spot: it can require two devices and may only work seamlessly if you use an up-to-date Android phone. I'll give you a worst-case example:</p><p>I buy a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl">iPhone 16 Pro Max,</a> and I want to sign into my Gmail account. I can't use an authenticator app because I need access to set one up or switch to a new one in my Google account, so I have to use the fallback method. Google then shows me a QR code. A QR code on the screen of the <strong>only device I have</strong> and the one I'm trying to use to sign into my account. Can you spot the problem here?</p><p>The secondary problem is, what if I do have a QR code scanner on my new iPhone and scan the code? What happens next? If I have an Android phone with the latest version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-google-play-services">Google Services</a> installed, the process can be whisked away and handled automatically. It could be done through something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens</a> or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, so it works with one device.</p><p>Since I am trying to do this on my iPhone, I just have to use the fallback for the fallback and get an SMS. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-time-stop-using-services-force-you-use-sms-based-two-factor-authentication">SMS authentication is insecure</a>, but it's necessary. It makes sense to use this for Android phones and a Google account. Not so much for other devices.</p>
<p>This is the real problem with authentication. It's always going to require some extra steps, and those extra steps can be a pain in the you-know-what. Using your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/display-fingerprint-sensors-and-cold-weather-could-mean-problems">fingerprint scan</a> — something that never changes and is your identity, not a means of authentication — was a big step towards making all this less messy. Unfortunately, you can't use the fingerprint until you have it set up and Gmail doesn't support using it to get into your account for the first time.</p><p>I don't know how you "fix" this, but I do know that really smart people are working on it. We've seen things progress from an on-device keychain that holds auth methods to fingerprint scans, to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-brings-passkeys-to-android-and-chrome">Passkeys</a>, and now QR codes. Keeping SMS as a fallback option is smart, too, because every device with a phone number can get one.</p><p>Google still has yet to reveal all the details of how this will work, so we will likely hear more about it before it rolls out. In any case, we have reached out to Google for more information and will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>I think this will be fixed, even though I don't know how. Then, we will have to wait until every service we want to use adopts safe and simple authentication methods.</p>

<p>When you've used as many phones as I have over the years, there are some that tend to stick in your memory better than others. Apple's release of the iPhone 3GS sparked my love for smartphones, while jailbreaking laid the foundation for when I would later join the world of Android and rooting. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> was my first experience with a foldable phone, and now I don't leave home without one.</p><p>Although I had been hoping for Google to release a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, the original Pixel Fold didn't quite do it for me. Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/you-should-love-the-oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> captured my heart as it set the standard for what I think a book-style foldable phone should offer.</p><p>At the time, it was thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> with larger screens while offering better battery life, faster charging, better cameras, and the list goes on. Sure, it lacked wireless charging, and I had to jump through hoops trying to find the right stylus. But hey, it got everything else right. So much so that I didn't want to stop using it even as newer and more powerful phones came my way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QH2Pc5qGSmJ2kLAKXZ9ix4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to predecessor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QH2Pc5qGSmJ2kLAKXZ9ix4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, not all dreams are meant to be granted, and this is the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">OnePlus Open 2</a>. Following the news that it would not launch in 2025, I was rather dejected and wanted to figure out how to get my hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>. But without carrier subsidies to rely on, paying extra just to have it imported isn't currently on the cards.</p><p>So, instead, I wanted to see if the Open was still as good as I thought or if I was just living in the proverbial "reality distortion field."</p><p>Fast forward a week or so, and I think I've found myself stuck between fantasy and reality. From a hardware perspective, it's a pretty tight race between the OnePlus Open and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. That's a testament to both OnePlus and Google, as the Open was released in October 2023, while the 9 Pro Fold feels incredibly more modern than its predecessor.</p><p>The Open didn't fall short in terms of performance, which, again, is no surprise. It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and includes 16GB of RAM. Would I have wanted to see a OnePlus foldable with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>? Absolutely, but that's more of a feeling rooted in me wanting the fastest and most powerful phone possible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="nwoQLQvnNWYC4tzy8W9wW7" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-12.jpg" alt="App Drawer multitasking from OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwoQLQvnNWYC4tzy8W9wW7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the software, well, it's exactly what you'd expect from a OnePlus or OPPO phone. All of the "normal" stuff works fine, but I didn't come away feeling the same about multitasking. Don't get me wrong, I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-android-multitasking-ui-ranked">Open Canvas</a> is fantastic in a lot of ways, especially on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>. However, I also think that I still prefer Samsung's split-screen approach because of the way that I use foldables.</p><p>When it comes to the cameras, not much has really changed, as I still think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-z-fold-6-and-oneplus-open-camera-against-mother-nature-the-results-were-unexpected">it beats Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> in that regard. It's not better than the Galaxy S25 Ultra or iPhone 16 Pro Max, but it's right up there with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Of course, these all fall short when compared to foldable phones released in regions that aren't the U.S., but I digress.</p>

<p>There was one thing that's really left a thorn in my side since I started using the Open again — battery life. It's just bad. Initially, I thought it was because I was switching over from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. That's a new phone with a new battery, while I was switching to a phone from 2023 with a battery that has really been put through the wringer.</p><p>But then it got worse. Since moving my spare SIM over to the Open a little over a week ago, I've been unable to make it through an entire day without needing to recharge before bed. I don't mean that the phone's running out of juice an hour or two before. I mean that I take it off the charger between 7-8 AM in the morning, and I'm down to 20% or lower by 4-5 PM.</p><p>It's reached the point that I actually couldn't wait to be done using the Open so I could flip a coin and go back to either the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Galaxy Z Fold 6. And for the first time in who knows how long, I actually wish a modern phone had a user-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-removable-battery">replaceable battery</a>. Just let me swap it out or take it somewhere to be done in a day or two, and everything would be golden. Which isn't exactly something that I'd expect to say in 2025.</p>

<p>When it's all said and done, I think that at that moment, the OnePlus Open was the best thing since sliced bread. In a lot of ways, it still holds up, to the point that I'd be happy even if OnePlus were to just re-release it. Oh right, that already kind of happened with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">Apex Edition</a> that you can no longer buy.</p><p>For as much as I wanted to fall in love with the OnePlus Open again, that "spark" just isn't there for me. Maybe I will try to figure out a way to replace the battery and give it another shot. Or maybe I'll just wait and see if the Galaxy <del>Z Fold SE</del> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Z Fold 7</a> finally delivers what I've wanted from Samsung for the past couple of years.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini is gaining another Gemini Advanced feature — this time it's saved information.</li><li>You can tell Gemini a few things about yourself to help better inform its responses in a way that's personalized to you.</li><li>The feature is starting to become available for free Gemini users, but is not widely rolled out.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has earned a reputation for steadily migrating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> features to Gemini's free tier, and that continues with the rollout of Gemini's "saved info" tool — becoming available now for free users. While not fully rolled out yet, the feature has been spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1izm0h1/gemini_added_saving_info_to_free_users/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> on the Gemini web client and was first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/28/gemini-saved-info-free/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>Saved information in Gemini essentially serves as a basic memory that can help the AI assistant deliver more personalized responses. "Share info about your life and preferences to get more helpful response," the company explains. "Add new info here or ask Gemini to remember something during a chat."</p><p>Previously, Gemini's saved info tab was only available for Gemini Advanced users and locked behind the $20 per month <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a>. It's still restricted to the English language only, but it is now starting to appear for free users. Gemini users may see a pop-up explaining that the feature is available, or can manually find it by opening the <strong>Gemini sidebar</strong>, selecting the <strong>Settings gear</strong>, and clicking <strong>Saved info</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2930px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="CCVzKZbpDbPay2jw76qg6Y" name="Gemini-Advanced-Saved-Info" alt="The saved info section of Gemini's web client." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CCVzKZbpDbPay2jw76qg6Y.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2930" height="1640" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google shares a few examples of the type of information that Gemini might find helpful:</p>
<ul><li>Use simple language and avoid jargon</li><li>I’m vegetarian, so don’t suggest recipes with meat</li><li>After responding, include a Spanish translation</li><li>When trip planning, include the cost per day</li><li>I can only write code in JavaScript</li><li>I prefer short, concise responses</li></ul>
<p>The above examples show that saved information in Gemini doesn't have to be very personal to be helpful. However, something like "I'm vegetarian" could be useful while Gemini compiles responses or suggestions to your queries, especially those involving food. Gemini will remember these facts until you delete them, and there is an option to disable saved information altogether.</p><p>Google makes Gemini Advanced-exclusive features available to free accounts on a fairly regular basis. Recently, it added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-adds-document-upload-and-analysis-for-free-users">document upload and analysis for free Gemini users</a>. If you aren't seeing saved information in Gemini yet, it should appear in the app and web client over the next few days.</p>

Both include great app support, though some of the main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-vs-oura-ring-gen-3">differences between the Oura Ring 3 and 4</a> primarily include the next-gen ring's updated sensors for even better health monitoring, and the addition of automatic activity detection (AAD) for heart rate data.</p><p>If those aren't dealbreakers, however, it's worth considering the extra $50 off to go last-gen—especially if you're a casual smart ring user.</p>

<p>Ground-breaking battery life on a Wear OS watch is reason enough to buy the stunning new OnePlus wearable. The magnificent screen is mighty large, but the right band offsets the size and compliments it just nicely. Invest in two to three of the best OnePlus Watch 3 bands to have a versatile set of straps at your disposal.</p><p>For OnePlus loyalists who own the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> in Ocean Blue, the first-party OnePlus Watch Strap in Nordic Blue is a must-have. This fluororubber band is made of a similar material as the Pixel Watch Active Band, which is also hypoallergenic, waterproof, and velvety soft to the touch. It's my absolute favorite band in the world so I can't recommend the similar OnePlus Watch Strap enough, despite the considerable asking price.</p><p>A classic stainless steel band is another necessary piece. You have plenty of such options to wear with your OnePlus Watch 3, thanks to its compatibility with universal quick release connectors. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/spigen-modern-fit-band-samsung-galaxy-watch-review">Spigen Modern Fit Watch Band received a glowing review</a> from Android Central's Derrek Lee so that's the one we recommend wholeheartedly. Available in black and silver, it's wallet-friendly, looks brilliant, feels durable, and works just right. You even get extra links in the box in case you need to extend the strap some more.</p><p>After you've snagged a band or two, be sure to purchase a scratch-proof <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-watch-3-screen-protectors">OnePlus Watch 3 screen protector</a> as well. It's not a must, but tiny nicks and scrapes are impossible to avoid on a watch used regularly, so you might want to err on the side of caution.</p>

<p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/unlock-the-future-bmw-digital-key-now-available-on-motorola-edge-50-ultra-and-motorola-razr-50-ultra-motorola-razr/">announced</a> this week that it will be expanding BMW's digital key compatibility with two new devices. Starting this week, users with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch">Motorola Edge 50 Ultra </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-price-configuration-leak">Motorola Razr Plus </a>phones will be able to add the BMW's Digital Key.</p><p>Once the digital key is added to their device, users can simply walk. to their cars, tap on the door's handle, and unlock it. Additionally, when phones are placed inside the vehicle's charging tray, it will automatically start the car as well. This is enabled by the Near Feild Communication (NFC) feature developed for two Android-powered devices to communicate when at a distance of 4 cm or less.</p><p>Additionally, through the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15 </a>update for the Edge, users can access more capabilities via the BMW Key Plus. This gives them the ability to unlock their car hands-free by simply approaching the vehicle with the phone in their pocket. "The phone's ultra-wideband (UWB) technology allows the car to automatically unlock as you approach," the press release added.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can share access to this key with five other individuals,  "giving them the ability to unlock and turn on the car as well with seamless functionality across devices." It is important to note that, primary owners can restrict certain vehicle functions while sharing the digital key with family and friends.</p><p>This kind of tech can sometimes get tricky when you wouldn't want your car to unlock immediately in the presence of strangers, in those circumstances, "Users can opt for additional security measures, like turning off passive entry or requiring the phone be unlocked before the keys can be used."</p><p>To set it up, users need to <strong>Open the My BMW App and select: "Vehicle" (tab) > "Digital Key" > "Set up your Digital Key" </strong>and follow the instructions in the My BMW App.</p><p>Motorola joins a long line of devices that are also compatible with this digital key such as the Google Pixel series 6 and up, the Samsung Galaxy S20 and up, among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faq.bmw.ee/s/article/BMW-Digital-Key-Availability-Compatible-mobile-devices-xNANp?language=et">several others.</a></p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is taking an extra step to communicate its Watch 3 error with early buyers.</li><li>The company is including a physical, printed letter with Watch 3 pre-order shipments explaining the situation and customer options.</li><li>Buyers can either keep the watch, or return it. The company is working on producing new OnePlus Watch 3 units without the typo.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus made a mistake so small on its latest smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3, that the average person might not even catch it. The device is made in China, so it's inscribed with that fact — except an unfortunate typo reads "Meda in China" instead of "Made in China." It's on the back of the smartwatch, the part that touches your wrist, meaning it isn't noticeable while you wear it. To its credit, OnePlus is making sure everyone who pre-ordered a OnePlus Watch 3 is aware of the misstep and has the chance to get a replacement.</p><p>After becoming aware of the mistake, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-cant-use-meta-in-china-but-the-oneplus-watch-3-is-meda-in-china">responded to the issue on social media</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-pushes-open-sale-of-watch-3-after-meda-error">delayed new sales of the Watch 3</a> to make corrected models. Like many companies do, it owned the mistake on X (formerly Twitter), but that isn't always enough. Not everyone is on social media, so OnePlus is taking an extra step to communicate the situation to Watch 3 early adopters.</p><p>The company is including a physical, printed apology letter in the box with Watch 3 pre-order shipments, as shared by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1izjtob/oneplus_watch_3_arrives_with_a_apology_letter/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-typo-letter-3530576/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). The letter says that OnePlus "takes great pride in our brand and our strong reputation for product craftsmanship and design." It goes on to explain the typo and offer a few options for affected customers.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1izjtob/oneplus_watch_3_arrives_with_a_apology_letter">OnePlus watch 3 arrives with a apology letter</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS">r/WearOS</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The letter largely echoes the earlier statement OnePlus made on social media, but ensures all customers who pre-ordered the Watch 3 are aware of their options. Buyers can either keep the Watch 3 with the misspelled inscription, or return it — no questions asked. OnePlus jokes that the typo makes the early Watch 3 models "one-of-a-kind."</p><p>Despite delaying the sale of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a> until it can manufacture new watches, OnePlus is sending out pre-orders to buyers. Shipments include the Watch 3 and the accompanying letter, putting the onus on the customer to either keep or return it. A few OnePlus Watch 3 buyers in the above Reddit thread say they plan to keep it, as u/Marks12520 describes the gaffe as "not even noticeable."</p><p>The letter concludes with instructions for affected customers to contact OnePlus support if they need more help.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out an Android 16 Beta 2.1 patch to enrolled Pixel devices with a few bug fixes.</li><li>The short list of patches includes a fix for a problem that caused Pixel phones to reboot unexpectedly.</li><li>It's available as an over-the-air update for Pixel phones enrolled in the Android Beta Program.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released the second <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> beta to testers in the Android Beta Program two weeks ago, and is following that update up with a minor patch that fixes a few of the most annoying bugs. Android 16 Beta 2.1 is beginning to roll out now to enrolled Android 16 Beta 2 devices — which is supported by the Google Pixel 6 series and newer — and is described as a "minor update," per the update's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/release-notes#beta2.1" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p><p>Every pre-release software build is likely to have a few bugs or unexpected behaviors within, but the bugs squashed in Android 16 Beta 2.1 had the potential to be particularly frustrating. One issue caused Pixel devices on Android 16 Beta 2 to reboot unexpectedly, and another wouldn't let Pixel devices enter Doze mode. There are also fixes for choppy animations and "various other issues," according to Google.</p><p>Here's what Google's official Android 16 Beta 2.1 release notes say about the changes:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented devices from entering Doze mode. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/396603519">Issue #396603519</a>)</li><li>Fixed issues that caused some animations to appear choppy while configuring live wallpapers. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/397659072">Issue #397659072</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused devices to reboot unexpectedly. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/396541565">Issue #396541565</a>)</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, connectivity, and performance.</li></ul>
<p>Google's quick work of fixing bugs in Android 16 is a good sign that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-new-android-16-release-schedule-and-why-it-matters">the update is progressing as expected</a>. The company appears to be on track to reach platform stability for Android 16 beginning next month, with a final release coming sometime in the second quarter of this year. It released the second Android 16 beta on Feb. 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">with media, camera, and graphics updates</a>, as well as a few behavior changes.</p>

<p>Now that Android 16 is in the public beta phase, it's easy to get updates like Android 16 Beta 2.1. Pixel phones that are already enrolled in the Android Beta Program — with either an Android 16 developer preview or beta build — will automatically get Android 16 Beta 2.1 over-the-air (OTA) when it is available.</p><p>There's no official word on when the OTA for Android 16 Beta 2.1 will hit eligible devices, but it should be rolling out soon, if it hasn't already. To check for the update, open the Settings app and find the <strong>System updates</strong> tab. To <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">try out Android 16 Beta 2</a>, you can enroll a supported Google Pixel phone — Pixel 6 series and newer — in the Android Beta Program <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Now Playing has been broken for many Pixel owners dating as far back as November 2024.</li><li>The feature is a way of automatically identifying the names of songs playing around you from the lock screen.</li><li>Google finally identified the problem and has a fix coming with a future Android update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-now-playing-feature-google-pixel">Now Playing</a> is a handy Pixel feature that can identify songs playing around you automatically using an on-device library. When a song is playing, it'll appear on the Pixel lock screen, and you can go back and see the full list of songs you've heard throughout the day later. Unfortunately, the feature hasn't been working for many since Android 15 QPR2 rolled out, according to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/379008495?pli=1" target="_blank">Google Issue Tracker thread</a>. Luckily, a fix is now incoming, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-now-playing-fix-coming-3530449/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>The bug saw Pixel phones unable to recognize songs with Now Playing that it would have identified in the past. It's a tricky bug to discover, because Now Playing works in the background — unlike manual alternatives, like Shazam. Now Playing is a neat party trick for Pixel owners, though, and many users noticed it not working as expected in recent months.</p><p>On the Issue Tracker thread, a Google employee now confirms that a bug did indeed break Now Playing and that a patch is on the way. "Thank you for reporting this issue," the Google employee wrote. "We have a fix rolling out in an upcoming release."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kuFvM9PmU6gVVVTVSdNKLD" name="google-pixel-8-now-playing-lock-screen-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Now playing on the Pixel lock screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuFvM9PmU6gVVVTVSdNKLD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While that statement doesn't include specifics about what went wrong or when an update will roll out, it stands to reason that a patch could be included in the upcoming March Feature Drop for Pixels. As Android Authority notes, that update is already slated to include fixes for other annoying Pixel bugs, like the back gesture that doesn't always work.</p><p>The update represents a resolution for a problem that has plagued Pixel users for months, dating back to at least November 2024, according to the Issue Tracker thread. Per the thread, Google tried to fix the issue in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-3-gets-its-hands-dirty-fixing-a-slew-of-performance-issues">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 3</a>, but was only partially successful. Users reported that it still wasn't working as of the January 2025 stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> update or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">Android 16 Beta 1 version</a>.</p><p>Now, Pixel owners should only have to wait a bit longer to get Now Playing working on their devices again.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-voice-gets-a-handy-improvement-in-the-latest-update">Google Voice</a> is gaining two key features that will make using the virtual voice calling services easier for both personal and enterprise uses: call delegation and phone number transfers. The two updates are beginning to roll out now for all Google Workspace customers with a Google Voice Standard or Premier subscription, as separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/transferring-personal-google-voice-number-to-workspace-business-account.html" target="_blank">blog posts</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/google-voice-now-supports-call-delegation.html" target="_blank">announced</a> this week.</p><p>The first new feature, call delegation, is aimed at making it easier to collaborate in workspaces where everyone uses a Google Voice phone number. Essentially, Google Workspace admins can now "delegate" calls to other people — kind of like how call and extensions would work on a typical corporate phone line. When a Google Voice call is delegated to another person, Google writes that delegates will be able to:</p>
<ul><li>Answer calls on the delegator’s behalf</li><li>Place calls on the delegator’s behalf, including transferring the call to the delegator once connected</li><li>Transfer calls selectively to the delegator</li><li>Listen to voicemail messages and view voicemail transcripts</li></ul>
<p>Previously, there was no similar mechanism for transferring Google Voice calls from one person to another in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:297px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:215.49%;"><img id="HGZMub4AryQZf7L8Re4gCN" name="Google Voice now supports call delegation" alt="Call delegation in Google Voice." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HGZMub4AryQZf7L8Re4gCN.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="297" height="640" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The company explains that this is a highly-requested feature from Google Workspace customers who use Google Voice. It adds that in the future, call delegation will expand to make it possible for selected delegates to view call and voicemail history, as well as inbox management for chosen people.</p><p>The other update to Google Voice makes it possible to transfer a phone number from a personal Voice account to a paid enterprise Voice account. This is a big deal for Google Voice customers, as it establishes continuity — users may not have to switch phone numbers when moving from their own Voice account to their new company's Voice account.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.06%;"><img id="mVX2fnEPoqruA7cqVboAyR" name="Consumer to Enterprise Number transfer" alt="Requesting a number transfer for Google Voice." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mVX2fnEPoqruA7cqVboAyR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="961" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google calls the process "a significantly improved experience," and it can be done without contacting the company. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/legacy-google-voice-february-shutdown">Google Voice web client</a>, users can now navigate to <strong>Account Settings</strong> and find the <strong>Transfer your number to another Voice account</strong> area. Then, you can request the transfer by choosing a Voice number and entering your Workspace email for your business. After that, an administrator at your company can approve the switch.</p><p>Google Voice is a useful virtual voice calling service, and these updates make using it more akin to a traditional phone line than ever before.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> that include the sporty over-ear clips; you want true wireless earbuds that include a charging case; you want earbuds with around nine hours of battery life, or up to a full day with the intermittent use of a charging case.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you don't like earbuds with over-ear clips or you wear glasses and worry they won't be a good fit together;  you need earbuds that have an IPXX rating for water and dust protection, rather than general water resistance; you need earbuds with a physical headphone jack.</p><p>Although it's been a while since the Beats Powerbeats Pros were released, they've remained the best-sellers for the brand up through the recent release of a next-gen version boasting added fitness features. But if you don't need all the bells and whistles of a new product, the original Powerbeats Pro earbuds are solid, especially when you can grab them at such a competitive price.</p><p>The charging case includes a Lightning to USB-A charging cable with super quick charging. Per charge, the earbuds themselves get around nine hours of playback time, though Beats says you can get as much as a full days' worth when using the case. In addition to their over-ear clips, which make them a good option for runners or other fitness enthusiasts, they also come with four different-sized ear tips for optimal fit.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster has spotted One UI 7 beta builds for the Samsung Galaxy S23 on test servers.</li><li>This comes after beta builds appeared for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 earlier this week.</li><li>It's a sign that a One UI 7 beta program could soon come for the Galaxy S23 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung hasn't announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> beta programs for devices other than the three main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 models</a>; however, there are signs that point to an expansion.</p><p>A minor hint that Samsung could add beta programs for other devices soon is the appearance of One UI 7 beta pages on the company's official community forums for phones like the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Galaxy S23. The real indicator that a phone is about to get a One UI 7 beta is when beta builds appear on test servers — and that just happened for the Samsung Galaxy S23.</p><p>The first One UI 7 beta build for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a> appeared on test servers today, Feb. 27, according to Android tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1895139350037287348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1895139350037287348%7Ctwgr%5E3aeeb8ff406d8ae10924ec80a3f87c7b42e3a148%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidpolice.com%2Fsamsung-spotted-working-on-a-one-ui-7-beta-build-for-the-galaxy-s23%2F" target="_blank">Tarun Vats on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. The post identifies the build version of S918NKSU6ZYBG, with a CSC number of S918NOKR6ZYBG and a baseband version of S918NKSU6DYBG. While this doesn't amount to an official announcement, it's a good sign that a One UI 7 beta is coming for the Galaxy S23 soon.</p><p>That might not be great news for Samsung Galaxy S23 owners. If a One UI 7 beta program launches now for a phone, it'll likely be weeks or months before a stable version is ready. That means Galaxy S23 owners could be waiting until April or longer for a public release of One UI 7. For reference, the One UI 7 beta for the Galaxy S24 started in December and has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">gone through five releases so far</a>.</p>

First One UI 7 beta build spotted on test server for the Galaxy S23.

Build Version: S918NKSU6ZYBG/S918NOKR6ZYBG/S918NKSU6DYBG

Is Samsung gearing up for a One UI 7 beta program for the Galaxy S23 series?

Repost pic.twitter.com/7UIIqgPcWk<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1895139350037287348">February 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The apparent move comes shortly after One UI 7 beta builds appeared on test servers for Samsung's 2024 foldables. Both the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-z-flip-6-could-get-a-one-ui-7-beta-soon">appear to have beta builds in the pipeline</a>. This would suggest Samsung plans to run beta programs for some, if not all, of the phones set to get One UI 7.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Gboard recently achieved a major milestone as it crossed 10 billion downloads on the Play Store.</li><li>The company also reportedly pushed a small server-side update to Gboard, changing its Shortcut UI on Android.</li><li>A major Gboard update arrived last summer with "Emoji Sticker Combinations" through the Emoji Kitchen.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Gboard typically slips under the radar; however, it can no longer do so following a momentous achievement.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/26/gboard-10-billion-downloads/">9to5Google</a>, Google's Gboard app has recently crossed 10 billion downloads on the Play Store. This is a staggering number, considering it's 2x the number of active smartphones globally. The app's details on the store say it launched in June 2013, but the publication resurfaces its rebrand. Officially, the app was known as the "Google Keyboard." The company soon renamed it "Gboard" a few years later in 2016, having undergone several minor tweaks and updates over the past nine years.</p><p>The post also highlights Gboard's accomplishment alongside other Google apps to reach 10 billion downloads like YouTube, Photos, Gmail, and Maps.</p><p>Meanwhile, the publication spotted Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/27/gboard-shortcuts-button/#more-663358">rolling out a small UI change</a> for Gboard that mixes up its previous design language. Discovered in version 14.9, Gboard's shortcut button, which opens up its full shortcut menu, falls in line with the options users feature in the row above the keyboard.</p><p>It was noted that currently (if the update hasn't arrived), the shortcut button offers a colored background that adheres to your Android device's color scheme. With v14.9, that color disappears, leaving the filled in boxes to fall into a black or white color. The latter's color shift will depend on whether you're in light or dark mode.</p><p>While the shortcut is no longer contained within a circular housing like the mic icon, the button does blend in with the rest of your "favorited" shortcuts above the keyboard.</p><p>The post states this is a server-side update, meaning it could take time before everyone sees it. Android Central has spotted this update today, so it shouldn't take long before it's widespread.</p>

<p>One of the standout updates for Gboard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/june-2024-android-feature-drop">arrived last summer</a> when Google dropped its June feature drop. Specifically, the update hit the Emoji Kitchen, letting users combine emojis into an all new creation. These aren't to be used as typical emojis in texts, but rather as large stickers. The "Emoji Sticker Combinations" will fuse two selected emojis, displayed in the recommended field when selecting.</p><p>The company also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gboard-split-keyboard-layout-for-foldable-phones-and-tablets">solved a typing issue</a> on larger screen devices like foldables with Gboard. The app's update lets users split it into two halves, making it easier for your thumbs to reach the keys you need to without discomfort.</p><p>There are usually subtle updates to apps such as Gboard throughout an OS' lifespan and Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">is already pushing</a> for Android 16. The next major OS entered Beta 2 recently, keeping it on schedule for its intended Q2 2025 release. Perhaps there will be more for Gboard down the road with Google.</p>

<hr>
<p>As we wait impatiently for Meta to release its next generation of AR and smart glasses, Meta is tantalizing us with its new Aria Gen 2 glasses that very few people will ever get to try — but sound technically impressive and make us excited for the inevitable consumer version.</p><p>A follow-up to Meta's original Aria glasses released in 2020, the Aria Gen 2 glasses have no AR holographic capabilities but are crammed full of RGB, 6DOF SLAM, eye-tracking cameras, and even GPS tracking to interpret the world and your body's gaze and actions.</p><p>On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/project-aria-gen-2-next-generation-egocentric-research-glasses-reality-labs-ai-robotics/">Meta blog</a>, you can see a pair of videos of the Aria Gen 2 in action, including an impressive demo of a visually impaired woman using the familiar "Hey Meta" command to have Aria Gen 2 guide her with audio cues to the produce section of a grocery store to find apples. It looks like a next-gen version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/ray-ban-meta">Be My Eyes accessibility tool</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>.</p>

<p>"Project Aria from the outset was designed to begin a revolution around always-on, human-centric computing," says Richard Newcombe, VP of Meta Reality Labs Research. The first-gen version was recently used to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/egomimic-project-aria-georgia-tech-ego4d-robotics-embodied-ai/">provide visual data for a robot</a> in order to help it learn to perform human tasks, translating what we normally see and hear into data a robotic AI can use.</p><p>These smart glasses use custom Meta silicon to process SLAM, eye tracking, hand tracking, and speech recognition on-device. And they last 6–8 hours — a 40% boost over the last gen — with no weight increase and looking significantly skinnier than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a>.</p><p>They're still heavier than Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, with noticeably thick arms, but might blend in as somewhat "normal" glasses when the camera light isn't on, and seemingly doesn't need any kind of wireless puck like Project Orion.</p>

<p>"With Gen 2 glasses, we are building AI capabilities with a deeper understanding of the wearer's context and environment," says Mingfei Yan, Director of Project Management for AR research.</p><p>The Gen 2 version adds a PPG in the nosepad for continuous heart rate data, as well as a contact microphone "to distinguish the wearer’s voice from that of bystanders."</p><p>Meta is largely offering Aria Gen 2 glasses to researchers and students, allowing them to take this raw stream of multisensor data and do whatever they might think of. You can sign up to try out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfukXP5q6dclAAA3php-OCO1TcwFc5Opegrvw23wHwEbOFJbA/viewform">Aria Gen 2</a> at that link.</p><p>Recent leaks suggest that Meta is working on new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">Oakley smart glasses</a>, a $1,000 Hypernova prototype with AR capabilities, and a follow-up to Orion codenamed Artemis. Meta won't sell the Aria Gen 2, but some of its capabilities, sensors, and Meta AI upgrades could easily end up in new Meta consumer devices in the next year or two.</p><p>For now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> like Ray-Ban Meta and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> are helping us cope with the wait, and we'll have to see how much Aria Gen 2 DNA ends up on display at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-announces-connect-2025-and-first-llamacon">Meta Connect 2025</a>.</p>

<ul><li>A leak claims Nothing's new Phone 3a button will be called the Essential Key, which activates its new AI suite of Essential Space features.</li><li>Users can snap photos, capture voice notes, and more through various key pressing functions and the AI will "sort" and "categorize" them for you.</li><li>Nothing previously teased a new button, which was previously thought to be a dedicated physical camera button for the 3a Series.</li><li>The Nothing Phone 3a Series launches on March 4.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>An alleged discovery suggests the new Nothing Phone 3a Series button is more than we previously thought.</p><p>The leaks stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/first-look-at-nothing-phone-3a-pros-essential-key-and-its-features">SmartPrix</a> in conjunction with tipster Shivam Kumar, claiming the new button will be a part of an AI suite called "Essential Spaces." One of the suite's highlights is "Smart Collection," which seems to involve "sorting" and "categorizing" your digital data. Specifically, the post states the AI will sort images, audio, and text files you've amassed throughout your daily life.</p><p>The other side of this is Smart Collection's recognition, which lets it place your captured images, audio, and text files in the appropriate "Spaces."</p><p>The tipster's discovery adds that the AI suite will deliver "Focused Search" and "Flip to Record," a feature that will likely let users record voice notes. Then, there's "Camera Capture." Rumors claim this is only usable within the camera app as users can press this physical button or "Essential Key" to snap a picture. The result is said to be stored within Essential Space for easy rediscovery.</p><p>The Essential Key holds power over all of the AI suite's functions. A leaked splash screen states the Essential Key, located on the right side of the device, will "capture your thoughts on the go with the power of AI."</p><p>The publication claims users can press, long-press, or double press it for different functions. Pressing it once is used for capturing, similar to what was rumored for Camera Capture. Long-pressing is supposedly used for voice notes while double-pressing opens up Essential Space to see what the AI has stored for you.</p>

<p>Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-camera-button-official-teaser">teased a new physical button</a> for its upcoming Phone 3a Series early in February, which led us to believe it was a dedicated camera button. Now, it seems the camera is only a piece of the pie. The company's tagline read, "Your second memory, one click away." That sentiment is echoed in the recent leaks about the button, allegedly the Essential Key.</p><p>The post by SmartPrix claims Nothing is still fleshing out the AI suite and Essential Key functions. Rumors add a "full-fledged" version could arrive on the flagship Phone 3.</p><p>While all eyes are on the Phone 3a Series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">a quarterly report</a> video confirmed the Phone 3 is coming and will be a "milestone" for Nothing.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-leaked-memo">leaked email</a> from Nothing's CEO Carl Pei shed light on the company's newfound ambitions with AI moving into 2025. Pei stated the upcoming devices will offer “breakthrough innovations in user interface” alongside AI. The UI redesign is also designed to make the user's life "easier."</p><p>We don't have much longer to wait for the Nothing Phone 3a Series. The company has confirmed the phones will launch on March 4.</p>

<ul><li>Amazon announced its new AI assistant — Alexa Plus, which is said to be more conversational and intuitively understands the user's needs.</li><li>Alexa Plus can interact across different streaming, home devices, and shopping apps. While also effortlessly performing tasks like summarizing texts, emails, or complex topics.</li><li>Alexa Plus comes for $19.99 per month for those not subscribed to Amazon Prime but is free for Prime subscribers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon seems to finally be getting on the AI train, so to speak, as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence">launched </a>the new Alexa Plus this week. According to the company, this newly supercharged AI powered assistant is more intuitive, understanding the user's needs more effortlessly than the previous model.</p><p>The company claims that Alexa Plus is trained to not only summarize complex topics but also manage and "protect your home, make reservations, and help you track, discover, and enjoy new artists." Amazon seems to be bringing a multi-faceted approach to all of its products by integrating Alexa Plus within them. Users will be able to find or buy anything online with just a quick voice command to this AI-powered assistant.</p><p>Amazon further stated that it had to practically rebuild the new assistant using tech that connects a variety of large language models (LLMs), which will help it interact with other services across the globe. "To achieve this, we created a concept called 'experts' — groups of systems, capabilities, APIs, and instructions that accomplish specific types of tasks for customers," the release added.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pVh5D8oGiZ2Hn8wkiMVQAH" name="Amazon-Alexa-Plus-navigation" alt="Amazon Alexa Plus is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pVh5D8oGiZ2Hn8wkiMVQAH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This means that Alexa Plus can seamlessly connect to varied applications and services that are outside the Amazon universe as well. As a result, the company's assistant can cross-communicate with a wide range of apps, including streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu, and also home devices from companies like Philips Hue and Roborock.</p><p>Additionally, Alexa Plus can also be directed to complete tasks on the user's behalf behind the scenes. For instance, if your oven needs fixing, Alexa Plus will be able to look for the service provider online and arrange the repair based on your schedule — all without the user's intervention.</p><p>Like any other AI assistant on the market, Alexa Plus can answer questions like "What is the lowest point in any ocean on earth?” or just something vague like “What’s the song that Bradley Cooper sings at the start of that country music movie?" However, users can go a step further and upload documents, emails, or photos — via a desktop browser or the mobile app — for the assistant to analyze and summarize for them if needed, a feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-adds-document-upload-and-analysis-for-free-users">opened up to free users</a>.</p><p>Lastly, Amazon says that the user gets to control information that is shared with the AI assistant via a built-in Privacy dashboard on the app.</p><p>This new and improved Alexa Plus comes for $19.99 per month for those not subscribed to Amazon Prime. However, if you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, access to Alexa Plus is free, adding even more value to the subscription. It will roll out in the U.S. in the coming weeks for Echo Show owners, although you'll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCCNHWV5?ref=ods_surl_xaa_us">sign up for early access</a> to get it. Everyone else will receive Alexa Plus over the coming months.</p>

From Viture to Xreal, TCL Ray-Neo and a random assortment of other companies that didn't quite last, smart display glasses have been on a path to greatness for sometime but never quite achieved it. That is, until Xreal One came along.</p>

<p>Xreal has always made good, competitive products in the smart display glasses category, but Xreal One presses the reset button on what I thought smart display glasses could do.</p><p>That all starts from the moment you plug them in. A Quick flash of the Xreal logo appears, and just a second or two later, you're greeted with a giant floating virtual monitor in front of your face. You've likely heard this pitch before when reading about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a>, but all of those glasses only offer a slice of Xreal One's functionality, not the whole pie.</p><p>The real joy with Xreal One is the simplicity of the product. Three degrees of freedom (3DoF) is enabled by default, so the virtual monitor floats in real space from the moment you turn it on. There's no room for scanning to do or some special mode to enable. It just works, and it's the shot in the arm the product category has seriously needed.</p>

<p>Xreal One is available at Amazon and Xreal.com for $499.

<p>Xreal One is the best pair of smart display glasses I've ever used, full stop. I've used my fair share of them over the years, from TCL Ray Neo to Viture and several other brands you might not recognize, but none have done the job as well as Xreal has here. Aside from excellent design and technical specs, Xreal One nails the implementation and concept of smart display glasses in a way none of these brands yet have, and it makes all the difference.</p><p>When I first got my pair, I wasn't sure what to expect. Most smart display glasses feel like carbon copies of one another, and few of them work very well. Xreal One not only fixes some of the most major pain points — brightness levels, display edge fringing, weight, comfort, and display clarity — but it also adds near-perfect 3DoF tracking that's enabled by default.</p><p>Unlike some other smart display glasses that support the feature, Xreal One's 3DoF tracking doesn't constantly shift or slide over time. When I put on a pair of Xreal One glasses, the giant virtual screen appears in front of me and stays there no matter how much I move. Even if I get up and put the glasses down, the screen is where I left it before I got up. That's a win in and of itself, and it makes these finally <em>fun</em> to use instead of an annoying chore.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Xreal One not only fixes some of the most major pain points of smart display glasses — brightness levels, display edge fringing, weight, comfort, and display clarity — but it also adds near-perfect 3DoF tracking that's enabled by default.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's impossible to understate how important this is to this category of product. Most smart display glasses requrie some sort of external peripheral to provide proper 3DoF tracking. Even the ones that have 3DoF built-in — like TCL Ray-Neo glasses — often suffer from drift, meaning the virtual monitor will slowly move over time.</p><p>This makes 3DoF an <em>essential</em> part of the Xreal One experience, and it's something that just works out of the box without needing to switch modes or toggle something special. In addition to that, the X1 chip allows Xreal One glasses to deliver an industry-leading motion to photon latency of 3ms, meaning that any head movements made are completely lag-free.</p><p>While the default settings are wonderful, additional settings are a quick double-press of the power button away. This brings up a menu that looks and feels identical to a proper monitor. It's got all the toggles and options you would expect of a proper monitor, too, including special options that are only necessary on a pair of AR glasses including IPD adjustment — a first for smart display glasses.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The X1 chip allows Xreal One glasses to deliver an industry-leading motion to photon latency of 3ms, meaning that any head movements made are completely lag-free.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Xreal One is also the only pair of smart display glasses I've ever used that don't give me a headache when using 3DoF tracking. They employ a form of black frame insertion to keep motion resolution crisp. Previous pairs of Xreal glasses used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> all the time, which gave me a headache in a matter of seconds, but this pair offers a mode that employs DC dimming for folks who are sensitive to flicker.</p><p>With that said, Xreal One does use 240Hz PWM dimming when the default anchored mode is used. I haven't been able to use glasses like this in the past because of the low-Hz PWM rate, but I think the glasses' 3ms motion-to-photon latency helps make them usable. They're also <em>only</em> 500 nits of perceived brightness, and I've found that low-Hz PWM affects me most when brightness is greater than 1200 nits.</p><p>I've stuck with Viture One for years now as they were the only other pair of smart display glasses that used DC dimming and, even then, only at 100% brightness and with no positional tracking enabled. Xreal Air ticks all the comfort boxes for me and includes plenty of other calibration options to help make the picture look as good as possible.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Xreal One is also the only pair of smart display glasses I've ever used that don't give me a headache when using 3DoF tracking.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The viewable area is substantially increased over previous generations, with a 20% larger FoV at 50 degrees. In plain English, that means you can see the entire virtual monitor without having to move your head a bit to see the edges — a common problem among most smart display glasses. Edge fringing is completely gone, too, eliminating another common pain point.</p><p>Xreal One supports 3D video and an incredible ultrawide mode that has to be seen to be believed. The ultrawide mode makes the monitor 3-4 times wider than a traditional monitor, making multitasking a joy on a laptop.</p><p>You can customize the top button to perform one of several functions, including different ones for short-press, long-press, and double-press. I found that toggling between electrochromic tint levels was my favorite use of the double-press while single-pressing the button completely turned the display on or off so I could quickly see what was around me.</p>

<p>Electrochromic dimming isn't new to smart display glasses but there aren't too many pairs that employ the feature this well. The darkest tint level completely blacked out what was in front of me, making it super easy to see the display even in a sunlit area.</p><p>The frames are by far the most comfortable smart display glasses design I've ever worn, too. They use the same temple adjustment mechanism as some previous pairs of Xreal glasses — meaning they adjust to three different angles to fit different face shapes — and have a new nost pad design that's more comfortable than ever.</p><p>The weight is comparable with other smart display glasses like Viture One, but the design of the lenses — that trademark Xreal larger frame design — looks superb along with the new thinner optics. Xreal even curved the ends of the temples to keep them from sliding down your nose, a problem that occurs on some other brands' designs.</p>

<p>The biggest downside to Xreal One is the price. At $499, they're the most expensive pair of smart display glasses as of this writing. Tack on another $50 or so to that price if you need prescription inserts, and all of a sudden, you're spending more than what a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review" target="_blank">Meta Quest 3</a> costs. Considering these are just a wearable monitor, $500 can be a hard ask.</p><p>Of course, using a pair of glasses like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">will literally save your neck</a> if you find yourself traveling a lot or working from a coffee shop regularly. Looking down at a laptop is horrible for you and will cause problems over time. Wearing a pair of Xreal Ones will save you from neck pain since you can look straight at a big virtual monitor instead of down at a screen.</p><p>Furthermore, Nintendo Switch players will need to pick up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Adapter-Glasses-Charging-Android/dp/B0CZ6PX17L/">$40 Xreal Hub</a> to make it work with the glasses, and you'll also need an external power bank capable of 45-60W output. Any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best power banks</a> will do. All this nonsense is the Switch's fault — not Xreal's — since the Switch has to be docked to output video. Still, be aware that you'll need some extra hardware if you want to use this with a Switch. Other devices like the Steam Deck and simply plug-and-play.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EfiWxVZkc3HJNo7uwXBVzf" name="smart-glasses-review-viture-xreal-solos.jpg" alt="Comparing Viture One and Viture Pro smart glasses with Xreal Air2 Pro and Solos AirGo 3 in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EfiWxVZkc3HJNo7uwXBVzf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicho)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If $500 is too rich for your blood, Viture One is the best budget alternative. These glasses regularly go on sale for under $300 and have similar plug-and-play capability with laptops and the Steam Deck but don't offer 3DoF functionality out of the box. They also don't get as bright and have distortion on the edges of the displays, but they do offer DC dimming at high brightness, so they're great for anyone with PWM sensitivity.</p><p>Viture Pro is the closest competition based on display quality, offering a similar edge-distortion-free experience and a super bright OLED panel. They're regularly $100 less than Xreal One but don't offer native 3DoF support, just smooth follow. Viture offers a lot of fantastic accessories, though — like the Switch dock, which doubles as a power bank — plus the excellent new Viture Neckband that turns it into a full spatial computer. Xreal's best competition is the Xreal Beam Pro which is essentially an Android phone without a cell modem inside.</p><p>Xreal's upcoming Xreal One Pro glasses appear to offer an even better experience based on specs, including an even wider FoV, an optional camera module, and more. If you want to wait for the best of the best, they're expected to launch sometime in spring 2025.</p>

<p>I've been a firm believer in using smart display glasses instead of my laptop's monitor when I travel. I've tried bringing a more full-featured VR headset on trips, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-airplane-mode-size-complaint">they're just too big</a>. Xreal One is two <em>very</em> important steps closer to being a full-fledged spatial computer — native 3DoF and an industry-leading motion to photon latency, and that makes them more attractive than any other smart display glasses option available today.</p><p>Since I received the pair back in December, I haven't needed (or wanted) to use any other smart glasses. Throughout 2024, I used my Quest 3 as my main virtual monitor machine when not working at my desk, but Xreal One has all but completely replaced that headset as a daily work device for me.</p><p>These glasses have been a huge game changer for me in finding places to work in my house when my basement office isn't usable — either because it's too cold or the Radon levels are too high — and that's been reason alone for me to justify a purchase. If you're looking for the best pair of smart display glasses available, these are <em>the ones</em>.</p>
