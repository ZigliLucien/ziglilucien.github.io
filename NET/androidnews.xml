If you want to skip the Galaxy hype, now&apos;s your chance to jump on the OnePlus bandwagon. </p>

<p>Destined to earn a top spot in our list of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> of 2025, the OnePlus 13 utilizes the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and boasts excellent battery life, cutting-edge camera tech, and a sneakily-rugged construction with IP69 dust/water resistance.

<p>I&apos;ve been working at Android Central for quite a few years now, but the release of the OnePlus 13 marks the first time that I&apos;ve <em>ever </em>seen a smartphone receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">a 5/5-star rating</a>. Once you get your hands on the device, however, you&apos;ll quickly discover why.</p><p>Straight out of the box, the OnePlus 13 boasts an outstanding 6.8-inch OLED QHD+ display with a durable construction that&apos;s tough enough to withstand a full cycle in the dishwasher (I&apos;m not being hyperbolic — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/Pl5QVUadfbs"><strong>we actually tested it</strong></a>). Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the phone comes with the new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor (the same chipset that powers the S25 series), along with 12GB of RAM and all the latest Oxygen OS 15 software features. You also get some great battery life and charging speeds, while the flagship&apos;s camera tech could easily rival the best phones from Samsung or Google. </p><p>On the other hand, the OnePlus 13 isn&apos;t without a few faults. You don&apos;t get quite as many AI features as you would with the S25 Ultra, the software support isn&apos;t quite as extensive, and there&apos;s no stylus support. You&apos;ll also want to check with your wireless carrier to make sure that it supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>.</p>

<h2 id="missing-bluetooth-functionality-in-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-s-pen-caused-a-huge-uproar-among-fans-2">Missing Bluetooth functionality in the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen caused a huge uproar among fans</h2>
<p>It's funny how one little missing feature that less than 1% of users actually used (according to Samsung), caused such a big hullabaloo online. We all knew that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> dropped Bluetooth functionality from its S Pen. This seemed to disappoint many fans of the feature called Air Actions, which let you navigate the menus, snap a photo, and control other actions with just a press of the S Pen's button and a few gestures, without ever touching the display.</p><p>Then came a blog post on Samsung Business Insights which seemed to suggest that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mixed-reports-about-a-separate-bluetooth-s-pen-for-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-have-fans-puzzled">new version of the S Pen</a> would be available that would bring back Bluetooth functionality. This reignited hopes that the S25 Ultra could get Air Actions after all, but this was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-retracts-previous-bluetooth-s-pen-references-galaxy-s25-ultra">swiftly debunked</a> by none other than Samsung itself who quietly removed all mention of this separate S Pen from its blog post. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> even if it lacks this small perk from the previous model.</p>

<p>While using the S24 Ultra's S Pen as a remote shutter is a cool party trick, I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">don't think it really matters</a> in the grand scheme of things. By removing Bluetooth functionality from the S Pen, we got a lighter stylus and that's something many will appreciate. The S Pen Fold Edition for the Galaxy Z Fold series didn't have Bluetooth either, and I don't recall there being a big hue and cry about that.</p><p>On the matter of using the S24 Ultra's S Pen with the S25 Ultra, the basic functionality should still work. Remember that the S25 Ultra won't be able to charge the S Pen from the S24 Ultra because the new model doesn't have that tech built-in. It's understandable why people are so confused because Samsung's messaging hasn't been exactly clear. Even right now, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10004602/">support page</a> for the S25 Ultra's S Pen explicitly highlights this message, "Air actions are not available with the Galaxy S25 Ultra S Pen." This leaves room for interpretation that there might be an optional/ upcoming S Pen that could support Air Actions."</p>

<p>Google has announced a new voluntary exit program for employees who are part of the Platforms and Devices group — the same teams that are behind Pixel hardware and Android software.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/">9to5Google</a>, SVP Rick Osterloh sent a corresponding memo to the employees on Thursday (Jan 30) morning, and the search giant has further confirmed the publication.</p>

The said “voluntary exit program” is applicable for U.S. employees only for services like Android Auto, Android TV, Wear OS, and the recent Android XR platform alongside a wide range of Google and Chrome products, which all come under the same group.</p><p>The search giant is also offering a severance package for the new program. Here’s a statement from the memo, acquired by 9to5:</p><p>“The Platforms & Devices team is offering a voluntary exit program that provides US-based Googlers working on this team the ability to voluntarily leave the company with a severance package. This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year. There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.”</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that the program does not align with any changes to the product roadmap and is also not available to the entire organization, only to the employees in the U.S., as mentioned.</p><p>Considering Google’s handling of previous layoffs, this is a convenient move from the company as it allows employees to exit voluntarily. Since the merger of the hardware and software teams last year, employees are believed to have a better idea of their roles now. They may decide whether to stay "deeply committed" or move out—only they now have a convenient option to consider.</p>

<p>When it comes to upgrading an Android phone, it’s easy to get stuck in your ways. “I have always had a Samsung Galaxy phone and I want to stick with it.” That’s something we hear often. But the latest alternatives are giving Samsung a run for its money. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t get a Samsung Galaxy phone as your next snazzy device. The brand continues to make fantastic phones. But when looking at the Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13, you might find yourself wondering if it’s time for a switch.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-oneplus-13-the-design-and-basic-features-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. OnePlus 13: The design and basic features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="TnSftznBShisVRkjYUY3S5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-display-lock-screen-01" alt="Customizing the lock screen in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnSftznBShisVRkjYUY3S5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the larger phone in the new Samsung Galaxy S25 line, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus measures 6.7 inches with a 3,120 x 1,440 QHD+ dynamic AMOLED 2x screen. It affords a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and Vision Booster that ensures the screen is viewable in even bright sunlight.</p><p>Available in Silver Shadow, Navy, Ice Blue, and Mint finishes, the frame is made of armor aluminum and the screen of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. It boasts an IP68 rating so it can withstand both dust and water immersion. Nicholas Sutrich says in his hands-on of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> that he appreciates the curved corners that make it comfortable to hold along with the fact that it’s lighter in weight than the previous generation Galaxy S24 Plus.</p><p>You can get the phone with either 256GB or 512GB storage. It’s not expandable, so you’ll have to rely on cloud storage or offloading content if you need more. You’re best to save up for the 512GB version just in case.</p><p>The phone has a 4,900mAh battery and it supports 45W Super Fast Charging 2.0 along with fast wireless charging 2.0 and Wireless PowerShare. It has an ultrasonic fingerprint reader on the screen, 2D facial recognition, and a new security feature called post-quantum cryptography that is designed to further safeguard your personal data.</p><p>Samsung continues with its promise to offer extended support for the Galaxy S25 Plus: you get seven years of OS and security updates, so the phone will not only last far beyond as long as you want it, but it will also have great resale, trade-in, and hand-me-down value.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yvL4fzCNNRMgcc6cCBh9FN" name="oneplus-13-display-home-screen-03" alt="A customized home screen on the OnePlus 13 with a mountain wallpaper from the Backdrops app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvL4fzCNNRMgcc6cCBh9FN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparison, the OnePlus 13 has a larger 6.82-inch LTPO OLED Aqua Touch screen bosting 3,168 x 1,440 resolution, 1,600 nits brightness (4,500 nits peak brightness), and dynamic 1-120Hz refresh rate. The screen also includes Intelligent Eye Care 4.0 to help reduce strain on your eyes. Sutrich says in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">his review of the OnePlus 13</a> that it’s “the best display of any phone on the market,” easy to see in direct sunlight, which he tested on a beach in The Bahamas.</p><p>The Aqua Touch screen is designed to allow you to easily manipulate the phone even if your hands are wet or there are water droplets on the screen. This could be a game-changer for those who live in rainy or snowy climates, or for use in the field. It also has a Glove Mode for operating it even while wearing thin gloves.</p><p>Available in Midnight Ocean, Black Eclipse, and Arctic Dawn finishes, the screen is made of the company’s Crystal Shield super-ceramic glass. Visually, Sutrich calls it the “most beautiful phone I’ve ever used” (referencing the blue vegan leather model he was given for review). OnePlus, for its part, says the Ceramic Guard screen offers better scratch and drop protection than Gorilla Glass.</p><p>A stand-out feature is that the phone supports both the IP68 and IP69 ratings, which means it can not only withstand dust and be submerged, it can also withstand high-pressure water jets. This means you can take it on a boat, while jet skiing, or even literally toss it in the dishwasher and it will purportedly come out unscathed. In fact, Sutrich tested this theory, running it through a sanitizing cycle on his dishwasher for four hours, then taking it into a sauna and it continues to work just fine.</p><p>A bit heavier and thicker than the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus given its larger size, Sutrich finds the flat side rails on the front and back with the curved edge of this phone makes it easy and comfortable to hold. It comes with the same 256GB or 512GB storage capacities, so make sure to get the bigger one and look into cloud storage options if you think you’ll need more.</p><p>The battery is another stand-out here: it has a massive 6,000mAh battery and, like other OnePlus phones, lasts an incredibly long time. It also supports 80W (yes, you read that correctly!) SUPERVOOC charging, with the charger in the box (yay!) You can increase this to up to 100W with OnePlus’ SUPERVOOC 100W dual-port power adapter, which is sold separately. It also supports 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging. Again, you read that correctly. So, this phone not only lasts a long time, at least a few days per charge, but it recharges at blazing speeds.</p><p>“I am constantly surprised when I plug it in for 10 or 15 minutes,” says Sutrich, “and see that it’s already in the 80% range…If you’ve never used a OnePlus phone before, you’re going to be absolutely blown away by not only how good the battery life is, but also by how fast it charges. It puts every leading flagship phone to shame.”</p><p>While there’s no Qi2 support without a case, whereas the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus does offer built-in Qi2 support, OnePlus does offer a wide range of cases with Qi2 support and appears to be one of the only phone brands, if not <em>the</em> only phone brand, to be doing so. You’ll need a case either way, of course, but it’s worth noting.</p><p>The phone has traditional security features, like an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the screen, but nothing specific that will blow you away. Ongoing support is not as robust in comparison to Samsung, as you’ll only get four major Android updates and security updates for six years. But that’s still impressive.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-oneplus-13-the-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. OnePlus 13: The specs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-oneplus-what-can-these-phones-do-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. OnePlus: What can these phones do?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TMRESzEBxjtH3UiNPSVnQ7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-AI-select-01" alt="Using AI Select on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus to get context-sensitive actions from an image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TMRESzEBxjtH3UiNPSVnQ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that you have an idea of the bare bones specs of these two phones, it comes down to the most important question: what can these phones do, how well can they do them, and what makes them stand out?</p><p>Running on the ultra-fast and responsive Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus can keep up with even the most demanding tasks and use cases. You get a significant boost in performance from previous-generation processors, which is necessary to run all the on-board AI features that this phone has to offer. While others rely on the cloud to process certain AI functions, this processor allows the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus to do more locally. That even includes features like Generative photo editing.</p><p>Loaded with the Android 15 OS, Samsung also overlays its One UI 7, which affords access to plenty of cool Galaxy AI features along with customization and personalization options for the look and feel of the phone. Some new features include AI Agent: long-press the power button and you’ll instantly open the Gemini assistant, which works with native app integration. This means no matter what app you’re in, Gemini will assist with what you want, related to that specific app. Sutrich played around with this feature during his review and said it works well. He used it, for example, to find specific recipes within an hour-long YouTube video and it accomplished this with ease.</p><p>A neat new feature with Samsung One UI 7 is Now Brief, which shows AI-powered insights for your sleep, the weather, your daily schedule, and more. You’ll get Auto Suggestions, like a reminder to turn on the smart washing machine based on your usual weekly routine. Multimodal Search, meanwhile, lets you run searches in unique ways, like humming a song to be reminded of its name.</p><p>The most important factor with this phone is its heavy AI integration. You can be more productive and enjoy better context awareness as you switch among apps and use Gemini and other AI tools at your disposal. This includes everything from getting help composing an e-mail in the right tone, to searching for ideas for your next vacation, using Circle to Search to identify what jacket the person in that YouTube video is wearing, and more. Circle to Search now also recognizes phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and URLs so you can instantly open what’s needed. Overall, the phone better understands natural language, so it’s easy to communicate as well.</p><p>Along with the processor, Android 15, and Samsung One UI 7, all this runs smoothly thanks to the 12GB RAM. So, you can enjoy everything from streaming and capturing video to mobile gaming and more. Speaking of gamers, there are features specifically for them, including an improved cooling system, ray tracing, and a Vulkan Engine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ScGycu6KQsWdQYudxvvbhA" name="oneplus-13R-white-in-washing-machine-02" alt="The IP69 certified white OnePlus 13 in a washing machine with clothes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ScGycu6KQsWdQYudxvvbhA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does the OnePlus 13 stack up? Very strongly. It runs on the same Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile processor. The phone handles switching among apps at a blazing pace, with little to no lag. Sutrich says it exhibits the best haptics he has experienced on a non-Pixel phone. “I have never seen the phone falter once in its impeccable performance, whether that’s normal day-to-day scrolling or playing games at 120 fps.” He also calls multitasking “the best I’ve seen among any flagship phone.”</p><p>The OnePlus 13 has plenty of AI features as well, including intelligent search, AI Notes, and deep Google Gemini integration, just like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. However, much of the work is done via cloud computing, so you need an Internet connection, which is one downside.</p><p>It comes loaded with Android 15 and adds OnePlus OxygenOS 15 for its version of personalization, customization, and unique features. You get many of the same features you find in the Galaxy S25 Plus like Circle to Search and intelligent assistance for everything from composing messages to booking vacations, with the intelligence fueled by both Gemini and, with this phone, OxygenOS.</p><p>There’s a cool feature in this phone called BeaconLink that lets you essentially use the device as a walkie-talkie to communicate with another person with the same (or compatible) phone that is up to 200 meters away. This is great if you’re in an area that doesn’t have good mobile coverage, like on a boat or campsite.</p><p>Features in this phone will appeal to gamers as well, including the 12GB or 16GB RAM, depending on which variant you choose, Adreno 830 GPU, and overall fast and snappy processor along with efficient cooling.</p>

<p>The latest premium phones don’t just have fabulous cameras. They also have tons of pre- and post-editing tools you can leverage to get the best images and footage possible. Many of these tools use AI, and that’s true for both of these phones.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus has a 50MP wide AF OIS main camera, 12MP ultra-wide camera, 10MP 3x tele AF OIS camera, and 12MP wide AF front “selfie” camera. The 30x space zoom is impressive so you can capture less grainy, more detailed images from even far distances. Other features include HDR portraits, a nightography mode, and more. For video, you can record 4K video at 60 frames per second using the ProVisual Engine.</p><p>You’ll find all the same AI photo editing features that were in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Samsung Galaxy S24</a>, along with a few new ones. A standout is an improved version of Audio Eraser for videos, which can remove background noise, including conversations, in videos to isolate just the sounds you want. Sutrich tried this as part of his review and was pleased with the results.</p><p>There’s also a new feature called Auto Trim that will intelligently remove things like “ums” and “ahs” in your speech along with blank spaces. Use keywords and the AI will pick out which clips or sound bites aren’t essential and remove them for a cleaner editing experience. For videos taken at night, you’ll be able to better capture moving subjects without worry that the footage will be under or over-exposed.</p>

<p>Switching over to the OnePlus 13, OnePlus relies on Sony cameras for the OnePlus 13, which affords a massive step up in performance. Sutrich says it’s “easily one of the best smartphone cameras I’ve ever used.”</p><p>The set-up includes a 50MP main camera, 50MP telephoto camera with an incredible up to 120x zoom, 50MP ultra-wide camera, and a 32MP front camera. You can take 4K video at 60 frames-per-second and enjoy features like portrait mode, night scene, panorama, time-lapse, and more. Dual Exposure is worth noting, which can capture moving subjects with incredible clarity, along with Action Mode that accomplishes fantastic detail in action shots. Clear Burst lets you hold down the shutter to take multiple photos to capture that perfect moment.</p><p>What really sets this phone apart when it comes to the cameras are all the useful and effective AI photo editing tools. There’s AI Detail Boost, AI Unblur, and even a feature that removes distracting objects from a photo. In most cases, you’ll find similar equivalents with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, as well as other phones like Google Pixel devices. But one that works wonderfully and I haven’t seen in other phones is the AI Reflection Eraser. This will intelligently remove distracting reflections from a photo so you get a clearer image of something with glass or another reflective surface.</p><p>Bottom line: Sutrich says there “wasn’t a single category where I saw the OnePlus 13’s camera falter.”</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pm3DpFcaQkKZYM6wkynkSm" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-03" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pm3DpFcaQkKZYM6wkynkSm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes down to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. OnePlus 13, the OnePlus 13 is all-around the better phone. In fact, Sutrich says in his review that it’s “the best-built Android phone on the market, full stop.” You won’t find a better phone. Considering it’s the same price as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, the decision is simple.</p><p>Now, there are still reasons to stick with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. If you are familiar with the Samsung ecosystem and feel more comfortable with it, you might want to stay with that. This is especially so if you have Samsung smart devices in the home, and/or a Samsung Galaxy Watch and/or Galaxy Ring. If so, it makes sense to have a Galaxy phone as well and be able to enjoy everything the ecosystem has to offer.</p><p>You also get longer support with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, including a whole three more Android updates and an extra year of security updates. Considering you will probably upgrade to a new phone in another three or four years anyway, this isn’t a big deal. But you will be able to resell or hand this phone down to a friend or family member and be confident they’ll get the most out of it.</p><p>It's important to note that brands like OnePlus have really upped their game with their latest devices. The OnePlus 12 ranked among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> we have reviewed to date, and the OnePlus 13 will undoubtedly be replacing that model for the top spot.</p><p>There’s nothing specific to learn about how it works, since it’s incredibly intuitive. It’s the most durable consumer-level phone you’ll find on the market yet it’s still sleek and downright beautiful. While we wish it had more storage and Qi2 support built in, these are minor complaints, and really the only ones we can find with this phone.</p><p>The cameras and camera editing features, software, processing speeds, and performance are all top-notch with the OnePlus 13. If you’re looking for a new premium Android phone you can hang onto for many years to come, and that will give you access to multitasking, AI features, capture great photos, and even go into the hot tub with you on your next vacation, the OnePlus 13 is the one to choose.</p><p>You’ll still get a great device with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, including wonderful cameras, powerful processing and onboard AI features (that’s a huge plus worth noting), decent battery life, a sleek look, and extra-long software support. But overall, for most users who aren’t tied to a specific platform, the OnePlus 13 is a winning choice.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is admittedly not the most exciting hardware upgrade we were hoping for, but some of the new Galaxy AI features make you want to give it a second look. One in particular that caught our attention the most during our hands-on with the S25 series is the new Audio Eraser feature. Samsung says this will let you remove unwanted sounds from any video stored on your S25 device, and you can even fine-tune which sounds you wish to subdue or remove altogether.</p><p>If you've pre-ordered a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, here's how to use the Audio Eraser feature in your Gallery app.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-2">How to use Audio Eraser on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Gallery</strong> app on your S25 device and find the video you wish to edit.</p><p>2. When previewing the video, tap the <strong>Sparkle icon</strong> from the bottom to take you directly to the Audio Eraser page.</p><p>3. Alternately, you can tap <strong>Edit</strong> (pencil icon) below the video, and the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the far right on the next screen. Then, tap <strong>Audio Eraser</strong> for the AI to analyze the video.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4375px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.03%;"><img id="oymJNY3vAr4RWt63qyeEHe" name="audio-eraser-galaxy-s25-series-1" alt="Audio Eraser on S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oymJNY3vAr4RWt63qyeEHe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4375" height="3064" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>3. After a few seconds, you'll be presented with a few options. Tap <strong>Auto </strong>to autmatically remove any background noise in the video.</p><p>4. Depending on the types of sounds in the video and how legible they are, Galaxy AI will give you up to six options to manipulate.</p><p>5. You can then choose individual sounds like <strong>Voices</strong>, <strong>Noise</strong>, <strong>Music</strong>, etc., and adjust the intensity for each.</p><p>6. The <strong>Hear original</strong> button in the upper-left corner of the screen lets you quickly compare your edits to the original audio.</p><p>7. Once you're satisfied with your edits, tap <strong>Done</strong> and <strong>Save copy</strong>. This preserves your original video in case you need it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ex5Bc8nxVQwGpYDMakpErk" name="audio-eraser-galaxy-s25-series-2" alt="Audio Eraser editing menu on S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ex5Bc8nxVQwGpYDMakpErk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Audio Eraser can detect up to six types of sounds such as Voices, Music, Wind, Nature, Crowd, and Noise. Samsung cautions users that it's possible for the AI to not recognize all sounds, every single time, as it largely depends on the source audio quality and recording condition of the video.</p>
<h2 id="audio-eraser-is-not-the-sole-reason-to-get-the-galaxy-s25-but-it-s-compelling-2">Audio Eraser is not the sole reason to get the Galaxy S25, but it's compelling</h2>
<p>If you've used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a>, then you would have noticed that this Audio Eraser feature in the Galaxy S25 series is a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> on the older Pixels. The big difference though is that Samsung's implementation works completely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a> and doesn't send anything to the cloud for processing, according to Samsung. You can manipulate a many more types of sounds (six in total) compared to what Google offers. Audio Eraser can work on any video that you have stored on your device, so it doesn't have to be recorded by the S25 device itself.</p><p>The big question probably on you mind right now is, will Audio Eraser come to the Galaxy S24 series or older flagships? This is something Samsung hasn't confirmed nor denied yet. You can try out the latest beta of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">One UI 7 on the S24 series</a> if you come under the supported regions, but make sure you backup all your data first. I don't think Samsung will release Audio Eraser for older Galaxy flagships as it's one of their new marquee feature that it will want exclusively for the new phones.</p><p>This could be due to hardware processing restrictions or simply because it might want to force users to upgrade. Either way, if you must have this cool new feature, you'll have to spring for the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phone</a>.</p>

However, the higher-priced Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra models both support UWB.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-uwb-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-2">Everything you need to know about UWB on the Samsung Galaxy S25</h2>
<p>Samsung's latest trio of flagship phones pack a few hardware and connectivity upgrades, including Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 support. However, the base model, 6.2-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> still does not include an ultra-wideband (UWB) chip. Meanwhile, both the mid-tier, 6.7-inch Galaxy S25 Plus and high-end, 6.9-inch Galaxy S25 Ultra models feature a UWB chip.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-uwb-galaxy-s21-series-and-which-models-support-it">UWB</a> is a relatively new technology that became mainstream with recent Apple and Samsung phones, and is also found on other handsets. Essentially, it's a near-field radio communication protocol optimized for both data transfer and location. With better range and precision than Bluetooth, UWB is ideal for finding other UWB-enabled trackers and devices.</p><p>For instance, Samsung's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-announcement">Samsung SmartTag 2</a> — an item tracker that you can attach to keys, wallets, or anything else — has a UWB chip for precision finding. While older, standard versions of the SmartTag relied on Bluetooth, the newer model uses UWB. However, for this use case and many others, you'll need a Galaxy S25 Plus or Ultra phone rather than a base Galaxy S25.</p>

<p>Additionally, some other apps use UWB to connect with products and accessories if your phone supports the connection protocol. Some car manufacturers will let your phone work as a car key if it supports UWB, like BMW, Audi, and Ford. Tile is another example of a third-party accessory maker that uses UWB to connect with trackers.</p><p>For those who need UWB support, choosing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus </a>or Ultra is a must. Unfortunately, Samsung's cheapest Galaxy S25 model still does not include a UWB chip.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini 2.0 Flash is rolling out now for free users in the Gemini app.</li><li>It replaces Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental, which was once exclusively for subscribers, and will eventually replace Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro.</li><li>Google One AI Premium subscribers still get a larger context window and exclusive features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is now making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> available for free users in the Gemini app, replacing the placeholder Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model, and eventually older Gemini models. Gemini 1.5 Flash and 1.5 Pro will stick around for "the next few weeks" so users can continue their conversations. After that, Gemini 2.0 models — starting with Gemini 2.0 Flash will replace them.</p><p>Previously, the Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model was exclusive to Gemini Advanced subscribers in the Gemini app. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> members still get exclusive perks, like a one-million token context window (good for up to 1,500 pages of file uploads), Deep Research, Gems, and more. Free users get access to Gemini 2.0 Flash conversations and image uploads.</p><p>Google describes the Gemini 2.0 Flash model as offering "fast responses and stronger performance across a number of key benchmarks, providing everyday help with tasks like brainstorming, learning or writing." Comparatively, the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model it replaces was described as "an early preview and might not work as expected."</p><p>Presumably, the future Gemini lineup will include Gemini 2.0 Flash, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">Gemini 1.5 Pro with Deep Research</a>, and Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced — with the latter two models being paid offerings for Gemini Advanced users. All users now get improved Imagen 3 image generation, which "delivers richer details and textures" and "follows your instructions with greater accuracy," according to Google.</p><p>Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">became available for Gemini app beta testers last month</a>. It's unclear when we might see Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced, or other 2.0 models, become stable. The stable Gemini 2.0 Flash model is already available on the Gemini web client and is rolling out now in the Gemini app, with free access available for the first time.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is tinkering with a new shade for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-dark-mode-google-search-desktop">dark theme in Search</a>, giving it a subtle color twist. It’s not exactly in-your-face, but more like a quiet refresh that might fly under the radar for most.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/28/google-blue-dark-theme/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the new look swaps the usual dark gray for a richer, more vibrant blue. It’s a small but noticeable tweak, showing Google is always fine-tuning things to make Search easier on the eyes, especially in low-light settings.</p><p>It’s unclear exactly when this new look rolled out, as per 9to5, but it might’ve been quietly live for a while—maybe even a few weeks.</p><p>Right now, Google Search and the Android app use a dark gray theme, and while it gets the job done, some folks find it a bit dull. To spice things up, Google's experiment is a richer, bolder blue theme that’s noticeably deeper and more vibrant than the current one.</p><p>The switch to this new color scheme amps up the contrast between text and background, making things easier to read.</p><p>Spotting this change might be tricky. The current dark theme is mostly dark gray, while the new version shifts ever so slightly toward a faint blue tint. Luckily, 9to5Google shared some side-by-side visuals that highlight the tiny but noticeable difference between the two.</p>

<p>If you’re not spotting the new theme yet, here’s a hack: log out of your account and hop into Incognito mode.</p><p>The new dark blue theme is also popping up in the Google app for Android, but only for those rocking the latest beta version. It gives the Home and Search tabs a fresh background color, which tweaks how your search results look in the app.</p><p>In the Google app, the blue dark theme isn’t just about the background—it’s also giving the search bar and bottom navigation bar a lighter blue makeover, creating a cool contrast with the darker backdrop. But not everything has caught up yet; spots like the ‘Saved’ and ‘Notifications’ sections are still rocking the old gray look.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fitbit is giving kids a gaming gift for the new year that keeps them active in two new interactive ways.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/The-Pulse-Fitbit-Community-Blog/Fitbit-Ace-LTE-new-games/ba-p/5717831">community post</a>, Fitbit announced that users with an Ace LTE will soon download two new games: Shutterbug and Gnome Heisters. A press release to Android Central revealed that these two games are designed to ensure kids remain "active and engaged" while enjoying the relaxation of these two colorful smartwatch games.</p><p>Available via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbitacelte/answer/14953102">Fitbit Arcade</a> collection, Shutterbug is all about turning kids into photographers for their expressive new clients: bugs. The company states kids can "test their point-and-shoot photography skills as they’re tasked to take the perfect shot of bugs hiding in different locations."</p><p>All bugs in the area must be found and photographed before you can move on to the next level.</p><p>The next game, Gnome Heisters, is all about being meticulous and calculative. Fitbit states that, in this game, users need to help gnomes "complete escapades" so they can brag about pulling the greatest heist ever.</p><p>To ensure your child's Ace LTE is prepared for these new games, ensure the latest software (Season 3) is downloaded/installed. After, the waiting game begins as Fitbit states the update has started making its rounds this week. So, checking your Ace LTE periodically is recommended.</p>

<p>The Fitbit Ace LTE had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-debit-card-school-returns-update">major content drop</a> a few months ago that brought two games: Spirit Garden and Sproutlings. The former is a relaxing mindful game with guided practices while the latter is about raising and nurturing pets. During that update, Fitbit stated that it worked to improve the gaming experience for kids by adding "haptic feedback and ear-catching sounds."</p><p>The company also extended support for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-school-time-parental-android-feature-detailed">School Time</a>" to parents with kids who own an Ace LTE. Similar to its functions on Android, School Time on the Ace LTE lets parents set a period where the more fun capabilities of the device are unavailable. As the name implies, parents can set this time to revolve around school hours to make sure their child is attentive and engaged in schoolwork.</p><p>Additional updates for handling digital payment methods and "Daily Quests" are available on the Ace LTE, as well.</p>

<p>DeepSeek is a Chinese AI laboratory that has recently released the DeepSeek R1 AI model. It's an AI ChatBot based on Meta's free and open-source <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q3-2024-earnings">Llama 3.3,</a> trained by the DeepSeek team.</p><p>You're going to read a bunch of terms like LLM (Large Language Model) and reasoning, but what it all means is that researchers and engineers worked on writing software that can be "trained," either through manual input or by actually searching the internet, to find the answer to a question and present it in a way that sounds like a real person wrote it. The software can separate different problems from a single question and tackle them individually. It's pretty cool.</p><p>You've probably used something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-one-year-later">ChatGPT</a> or Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>. DeepSeek R1 is just like that, and some people think it's even more accurate than OpenAI's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-o1-lets-ai-think-before-answering">ChatGPT reasoning models</a>.</p>

<p>DeepSeek is good, but it's not perfect. It will return incorrect results and it's censored by the Chinese government. If you do try it, don't bother asking about the Uyghur people or Tiananmen Square.</p>

<p>There are two reasons: it's new, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deepseek-already-had-a-usd1-trillion-impact-and-its-just-getting-started">costs a lot less</a> to develop than similar AI models. A <em><strong>lot</strong></em> less.</p><p>As an end-user who is not an investor or Nvidia shareholder, I don't care about the costs. While it was far less than the amount OpenAI spent, it's still an astronomical amount that you or I can only dream of having access to. Technology is that way — companies choose to spend money to develop something instead of feeding starving kids. It's not going to change.</p><p>I will say one thing about the cost: Is anyone surprised that China was able to produce something of comparable or greater quality than a Western product at a fraction of the cost? Labor costs, taxes, environmental protections, and bureaucracy all add up. China has all of this figured out for the time being.</p><p>Other than the price, the simple fact is that DeepSeek R1 is new and works well. It debuted in December 2024, quickly gained popularity in mobile app stores, and now everyone is talking about it. It's the very same thing that happened when ChatGPT was first made public. We find new novelties interesting as a species.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-privacy-issues-with-deepseek-ai-should-you-try-it-2">What about privacy issues with DeepSeek AI? Should you try it?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1170px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.74%;"><img id="C7vVpqcpM2yDUZYnPejsyM" name="DeepSeek-privacy-policy" alt="DeepSeek's privacy policy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7vVpqcpM2yDUZYnPejsyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1170" height="734" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/data-protection-day-is-a-great-day-to-stop-using-deepseek">there are plenty of privacy issues</a>, and the same issues you would find with the same type of products from Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc., apply to DeepSeek. You are entering data into the machine every time you type in the box. How that data gets treated is very importan,t and companies need to be fully transparent about how it is collected, used, and stored.</p><p>DeepSeek is actually pretty good with this. The company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chat.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%20Privacy%20Policy.html" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> spells out all the terrible practices it uses, such as sharing your user data with Baidu search and shipping everything off to be stored in servers controlled by the Chinese government.</p><p>You can download and install DeepSeek locally to bypass some of this data collection, but not all of it. In any case, the company is likely betting that you either won't care or just won't read the privacy policy. I applaud both their audacity and transparency.</p><p>There is speculation that DeepSeek is also doing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-ai-china-privacy-data/" target="_blank">some very sketchy things</a>, especially through the mobile app. Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and META also do some very sketchy things through their mobile apps when it comes to privacy, but they don't ship it all off to China. Our official company guidance from IT is not to install it on a work-provided device and to not use our company Google accounts to sign into DeepSeek's website. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/us-navy-restricts-use-of-deepseek-ai-imperative-to-avoid-using.html" target="_blank">U.S. Navy has stated</a> that the service can not be used in any capacity by any service member.</p><p>Better safe than sorry. You need to think about these issues before you try DeepSeek. Don't let the hype and fear of missing out compel you to just tap and opt-in to everything so you can be part of something new. Not because DeepSeek comes from China, but because you should do this for <em><strong>every</strong></em> new awesome thing you read about on the internet.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1460px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="759HG5MKU7Z9hYmwewvnQQ" name="white-house.JPG" alt="The White House" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/759HG5MKU7Z9hYmwewvnQQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1460" height="821" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: whitehouse.gov)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's possible, and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/white-house-evaluates-china-ai-app-deepseeks-affect-national-security-official-2025-01-28/" target="_blank">already being investigated</a>.</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says that DeepSeek is being investigated to determine the national security implications of the service, and the administration's cryptocurrency czar, David Sacks, claims <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/deepseek-latest-news" target="_blank">intellectual property theft could be happening</a>. OpenAI is saying the same thing, claiming that DeepSeek secretly used its software.</p><p>President <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/trump-china-deepseek-ai-wake-call-rcna189526" target="_blank">Donald Trump says</a> this should be a "wake-up call" to the American AI industry and that the White House is working to ensure American dominance remains in effect concerning AI.</p><p>DeepSeek sends far more data from Americans to China than TikTok does, and it freely admits to this. The data is also potentially more sensitive as well. It's hard to say if someone in Washington will decide that DeepSeek is abusing our data or causing U.S. companies to lose too much money and ban the service outright. It might happen, and we shouldn't be surprised if it does.</p>

<hr>
<p>There's a lot that users awaiting One UI 7 can expect and a recent discovery shows that Google is making sure one of its apps is ready.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1884851908793311454">Tarun Vats on X</a>, a Google Maps update is here for those in the waiting room for Samsung's wider One UI 7 rollout (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/google-maps-now-bar-samsung-one-ui-7-update/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster noticed an update arriving for past-gen Galaxy phone owners marked as version 25.04.01.71725 for Google Maps. Vats states that this update adds support for the Maps chip in One UI 7's Now Bar and "Live Activities."</p><p>The post shows that users with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> (and likely in the One UI 7 beta) should notice Maps appear in the Now Bar. If it does, users will see brief information, such as its icon, how far you are to your next turn/destination, and an arrow for additional understanding. Users can also quickly exit Google Maps' navigation via the lock screen by tapping the button in the widget.</p><p>The Live Activities portion is the small indicator in the top left of your device's display on the home screen. It simply shows the distance and the direction you should be heading. Further, users can have a much larger navigation card on their home screen with the same information as the lock screen.</p><p>Users chimed into Vats' thread on X, stating the update has appeared on a Galaxy S23, meaning it will likely see Maps on the Now Bar once the update drops. Elsewhere, one user with a Galaxy S24 claims the update has been installed, but Maps is not functioning on the lock screen.</p>

<p>Google Maps integration with the Now Bar is nothing new as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-lock-screen-keeps-you-in-the-loop-on-sports-and-directions">Unpacked press release</a> stated as much last week. The latest Maps update provides extended support to past-gen Galaxy devices in the One UI 7 beta awaiting its full release. Users who've purchased a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> will see Maps, sports, entertainment, fitness tracking, and more via the Now Bar straight out of the box. Google also states that the Now Bar will support news articles, so you can quickly glance at what's happening.</p><p>Samsung's One UI 7 beta has progressed as users enrolled in the program got their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">hands on Beta 3</a> early this month. It was a significant update with a 1.2GB download size and a long list of bug fixes. Samsung was busy improving its Game Booster mode with playback setting changes, FPS setting alterations, and more. Some other QoL (quality of life) additions were implemented to aid the Quick Panel's closing operations.</p><p>The Korean OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">recently confirmed</a> that its One UI 7 (Android 15) update will drop onto past-gen Galaxy S devices "imminently." A blog post states the software is eyeing a Q1 2025 launch date for older smartphones after several of its elements/changes were "praised" by testers. Specifically, the company's AI features are reportedly sitting pretty well with users.</p><p>A Q1 launch gives us a time frame between now and March, so there's not much wait time left as Samsung polishes things up.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Qi2 became readily available for Android phones last year, but smartphones are often designed more than a year in advance of their release — that's partly why we've only seen a few Qi2-equipped phones debut, like the HMD Skyline. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-could-bring-qi2-revolution">2025 was supposed to be the year where Qi2 took off</a>, and it will be. But it's only because the Wireless Power Consortium bent the rules.</p><p>Qi is a ubiquitous wireless charging standard maintained by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), but it's aging. The standard only requires a minimum 5W charging speed, and doesn't utilize magnets or other fancy features. That's why the WPC designed Qi2 in coordination with big tech companies, like Apple, which effectively gave <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-favorite-magsafe-phone-grips-ranked">MagSafe</a> to the standard.</p><p>Qi2 has the Magnetic Power Profile, a magnetic connection method designed for precise alignment with chargers and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-magnetic-wallet-galaxy-s25-retail-listing">universal compatibility with MagSafe/Qi2 accessories</a> — or at least, it did.</p><p>We first spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-does-not-require-magnets">references to a version of Qi2 that did not require magnets</a> back in August 2024. After reporting on it, a spokesperson for the WPC swiftly corrected us, explaining that while the Qi v2.0 specification does allow for Extended Power Profile (EPP) devices without magnets to comply, these devices and accessories "cannot call itself Qi2 or use the Qi2 logo."</p><p>"Any packaging or marketing materials for such a device would have required language informing the consumer that this device does not include magnets," the WPC continued.</p><p>The WPC made similar statements in a more recent round of reporting around Qi2's magnet situation in December 2024, when the official X (formerly Twitter) account confirmed that all Qi2 devices must have magnets.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi Chris! A phone carrying the Qi2 logo is using the Qi v2.0 specification and Magnetic Power Profile or MPP.   So, yes, if it says Qi2 it must have magnets.

However, are two different power profiles that carry a Qi logo.  (1) Basic Power Profile (BPP) devices that charge at 5W,…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1870115419799072923">December 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Here's where things get confusing: the WPC has now completely tossed aside this premise. In January 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">the WPC announced a new branding</a>, called "Qi2 Ready." Essentially, it allows phones to use Qi2 tech without adding magnets — which renders every statement the WPC has made prior to this announcement irrelevant.</p><p>Phones branded as Qi2 Ready support Qi2 tech on the inside, such as 15W wireless charging, and leverage accessories to add magnetic connection. The WPC says these Qi2 Ready devices and accessories will deliver the full Qi2 user experience "in approved combinations."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> appears to be the first smartphones to utilize this Qi2 Ready standard, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">because it doesn't have magnets</a>. But that isn't actually clear. I've yet to see a single spec sheet, product page, or WPC listing for the Galaxy S25 that references Qi2 Ready. In fact, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/23212" target="_blank">official Galaxy S25 Ultra entry in the WPC database</a> lists the device as Qi2.1 certified — it doesn't mention Qi2 Ready or the lack of magnets at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1252px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.68%;"><img id="KfLQvtUCR7wwT2woMxfBp5" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-Qi2-Database" alt="The official Galaxy S25 entry in the WPC database." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLQvtUCR7wwT2woMxfBp5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1252" height="1248" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Wireless Power Consortium)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central reached out to Samsung about the uncertainty surrounding the Galaxy S25's Qi2 support, and the company returned the following statement via email: "The Galaxy S25 does support Qi2 wireless charging up to 15W — a case can be leveraged to take advantage of this capability."</p><p>Again, based on the WPC's original definition of Qi2, that shouldn't be possible. The newer "Qi2 Ready" workaround isn't mentioned at all, further complicating things. If that wasn't confusing enough, the WPC listed a Qi2.1 certification for a Samsung magnetic case that would round out Qi2 support on the Galaxy S25 — presumably one of the "approved combinations" it described — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/28/qi2-smartphone-cases-certified-database/" target="_blank">before subsequently removing it</a>.</p>

<p>Android Central also reached out to the WPC for clarification on the Qi2 specification, and asked about the confusion that the new standards could cause for consumers. We didn't hear back in time for publication, but will update this article when we do.</p><p>The saga surrounding Qi2 on Android is tough to follow, and that's the problem. Apple giving MagSafe to the Qi2 standard was supposed to create a unified ecosystem of chargers and accessories between iOS and Android phones. It was a rare gift from a company that likes to create so-called "walled gardens" and exclusive features for its users. Android OEMs and the WPC have squandered it.</p><p>We're now in a position where all iPhones are Qi2 certified with magnets, some Android phones are Qi2 certified with magnets, some Android phones are Qi2 certified without magnets, and most Android phones aren't Qi2 certified at all. Without sounding too dramatic, it's a borderline disaster.</p><p>Qi2 and the WPC are following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">bad precedent set by USB and the USB Implementers Forum</a> — there have been enough renamings and discrepancies that there are multiple Qi2 versions, and no one knows what any of them really mean.</p><p>Considering the lofty goals of the WPC, this outcome is extremely disappointing to see. "The Qi v2.0 standard will unify the wireless charging industry under one global standard, eliminating consumer confusion and enabling greater device interoperability," the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/standards/qi-wireless-charging/#:~:text=The%20Qi%20v2.0%20standard%20will%20unify%20the%20wireless%20charging%20industry%20under%20one%20global%20standard%2C%20eliminating%20consumer%20confusion%20and%20enabling%20greater%20device%20interoperability." target="_blank">WPC's website still states</a>.</p><p>Over a year after Qi2 was made available, wireless charging is more disjointed than ever.</p>

<ul><li>Google dropped a new easter egg on Search and, this time, is a retro throwback game called "Block Breaker."</li><li>Similar to the original game, Breakout, users have a single paddle, one ball, and four rows of Google-colored bricks in the company's version.</li><li>Google Search often drops its easter eggs out of nowhere, like its other throwbacks via Snake, Minesweeper, and Tic-Tac-Toe.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Every so often Google gets a little silly and adds in a secret easter egg for users looking for a little downtime.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-searchs-new-easter-egg-breaking-blocks/">Android Police</a>, Google Search has a new easter egg that takes you back to the days of retro gaming. Users can look up "Block Breaker" in Search and find its colorful logo and convenient play button. It's a game that reminds us of old phones with pullout antennae, rubber number pads, and a tiny screen. Google's version of this classic game keeps in theme with what you'd expect: a singular pad, one ball, and four rows of Google-colored bricks.</p><p>However, Google throws in different colored bricks and power-ups to make the game interesting.</p><p>Users hitting the right bricks can gain a bubble power-up that slows the balls down as they plummet back toward you. Another buff gives you two blasters on either end of the paddle that shoots up at the bricks. Then, there's the safety net — just in case you didn't see that third ball to your right.</p><p>Bricks with power-ups are clearly marked, so you know your next target. Additionally, on desktop, the game is displayed in a small, overlayed window (which you can also make larger). The left and right arrow keys slide you across the playing field while the up arrow sends the ball to kick things off.</p><p>The publication also drops a bit of history, stating Google's game, like all others, are reinvented versions of the original brick-breaking game, Breakout, by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak from Atari (known more as the creators of Apple).</p>

<p>Entering "Block Breaker" into Search will display the newest easter egg, as well as a library of Google's other games. Users can enjoy a session of Snake, PAC-MAN, Minesweeper, Tic-Tac-Toe, and more.</p><p>Google's no stranger to dropping unique and wacky easter eggs in Search regarding games or the time of the year — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-search-twosday-easter-egg">like Twosday</a>. In 2022, on February 22, people called it "Twosday" because the written date was all 2s. If you were on Search at the time and typed Twosday into its bar, you'd see results for the once-in-a-lifetime date alongside a bombardment of the number. This special occurrence isn't expected to happen again for another 400 years; well, 397 years, this February.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-mandalorian-grogu-google-easter-egg">magical, space-themed</a> easter egg dropped during Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian" hype in 2023. The cute baby Grogu was on Search that day for anyone who looked up information about the show. Grogu would enter on the bottom right of your screen and use the Force to yank your results off the page and pile them up.</p><p>The Force is truly strong with that one.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new year often prompts us to look to various smartphone OEMs for "what's next," and today (Jan 30), Nothing got candid about it.</p><p>Following the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/4BzC7ky0uw8">first quarterly update</a> of 2025 (near the 13:42 mark), a press release further confirms a launch date for the Phone 3a. According to Nothing, consumers should prepare to hear more about the upcoming midrange on March 4 at 5 am ET. Curiously, during the update, the company confirmed a slightly altered moniker for the device.</p><p>The device is confirmed as the "Nothing Phone 3a Series." Users interested in staying informed about the phone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.tech/">sign up at nothing.tech</a> for launch details when everything's ready. It seems things are lining up for MWC 2025, after all.</p><p>Nothing's co-founder Akis Evangelidis stated, "For the (a) Series we have a different set of users. When people buy a smartphone some are looking for the greatest specs, they want the latest innovations and processors." Evangelidis adds that the a Series phones are also designed for people who are "excited about tech" but also "happy with a great user experience."</p><p>The quarterly video highlighted how the Nothing a Series phones leverages its Community Members to create the product. The company states that it was something outside its comfort zone, but has found success. Nothing states the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> was an "amazing product" for testing and "pushing boundaries."</p><p>The video didn't end without a small teaser about the flagship Phone 3. Akis Evangelidis didn't expand much; however, he states that the device is on tap for a 2025 release and will be a "milestone" for the company.</p>

<p>Nothing is celebrating achieving $1 billion in lifetime revenue in January. The press release states this total has been built since Nothing's creation in October 2020. The company's financial officer, Tim Holbrow states, "Over half of that revenue has come just in the last year in 2024. And what’s most pleasing, is that’s exactly what we intended to do."</p><p>Holbrow attributes work done with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a>, Phone 2a, Phone 2a Plus, and the CMF Phone 1 for its most recent success.</p><p>Nothing confirms the launch date for the Phone 3a after it dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-or-phone-3a-could-be-coming-on-march-4">a mysterious teaser on X</a>. A pair of reflective black glasses showed what was on one user's screen: a message that read "launch March 4." The company then shared a few WIP (work in progress) sketches of an upcoming device, leaving users wondering what they should expect.</p><p>With its most recent update, we know the midrange is first.</p><p>Regarding the flagship sibling, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-leaked-memo">a leaked memo</a> by Nothing CEO Carl Pei detailed plans for the Phone 3. The device is on tap for a 2025 release, empowered by Nothing's AI software. The memo states that the device will "refine" the user experience designed to "make your life easier." Pei ended the memo by referencing a "landmark" product launch in Q1. This is likely the Phone 3a Series we've seen confirmed today.</p><p>Moreover, Evangelidis recognizes that the Phone 3 is a hot topic; however, the company is interested in getting the Phone 3a out first, before looking toward the flagship. After the midrange launches, Nothing will "focus quite rapidly" on its next flagship.</p>

Fortunately, thanks to the current sitewide sale over at Amazon, a great deal is exactly what&apos;s happening. For a super-limited time, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TZRP19J/"><strong>Beoplay HX noise-cancelling headphones can be bought at a whopping 40% discount</strong></a>, knocking the premium cans down to a much more reasonable $359.20. </p><p>As of writing, over 42% of the discounted headphones have already been claimed at Amazon, so if you&apos;re interested, don&apos;t wait to jump on this deal. </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a premium pair of headphones at a slightly less-premium price; you enjoy noise cancellation, a comfy fit, and elegant Scandinavian design.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a cheaper pair of headphones or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>; you&apos;d prefer Sony&apos;s top-rated and similarly-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">WH-1000XM5</a> (our favorite headphones on the market).</p><p>Sophisticated and versatile, these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> are built with audiophiles in mind.

<p>Or maybe you'd rather be in the orchestra, playing the instruments instead of conducting everyone's performance? Two new rhythm games on the Meta Quest platform let you do just this, and they've instantly rocketed themselves on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> list for their ingenious design. While these two share a few themes in common, their energy couldn't be any different.</p><p>Maestro is a semi-serious orchestra conducting simulator in which you play as a conductor and use your hands—not your controllers—to keep the group playing on time and in the right order. Get it right, and you'll be "unleashing the heavens" of music, as maestro Eric de Roch puts it. Get it wrong, and tomatoes will fly at you and your valiant troupe.</p><p>Trombone Champ Unflattened is all about silliness and fun, bridging the taboo sounds between notes in a way you can't fully appreciate until you've tried it. You don't even have to get the song right! Just play to your heart's content and make it to the end. The goal is fun, not winning, but there's room for both.</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-of-the-symphony-2">The magic of the symphony</h2>

<p>I've never been to a symphony in real life, but I've been part of a big band back in my school days. I never really understood the purpose of a conductor until I was in the shoes of one myself. Trying the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://maestro-game.com/mtm/">Maestro: The Masterclass free demo</a> convinced me that I needed to give this game a try, and I'm so glad I did.</p><p>Most music games give you an instrument to play from a first-person perspective. This is usually shown as music notes sliding down a linear path until you press the right button or slice the block the correct way. Everyone is familiar with the Guitar Hero interface, as I like to refer to it, and few games change up this formula for fear of confusing the player.</p><p>Maestro is both similar and different at the same time. Notes do progress from the back of the orchestra hall toward you as the conductor, but they don't all appear in one location. Rather, each section of the orchestra has its own set of notes and actions that will appear over their heads when the time is right.</p>

<p>It's your job as a conductor to take the appropriate action to tell the right sections of the orchestra when and how to play. A slow palm movement down will keep things quiet, while a quick jab of the finger lets a section know it's their time to shine.</p><p>Things start off simple enough but quickly get harrowing as song complexity and difficulty ramps up. Within a few songs, you'll be directing up to 120 musicians with your full range of movement. I've rarely had so much fun playing a rhythm game, and not with one that's a fully hand-tracked experience since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/unplugged-hands-preview">Unplugged: Air Guitar</a> debuted many years ago.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hCmgWbdnfQxNrgnH5LvCHQ" name="maestro-vr-official-screenshot" alt="Conducting an orchestra on the Broadway-themed streets of New York in Maestro on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hCmgWbdnfQxNrgnH5LvCHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Double Jack)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's more impressive to me is the breadth of actions you can perform. Unplugged works well because the camera can see your individual fingers at all times, so playing notes on a guitar is relatively easy for it to track. But Maestro uses your whole hand and your entire arm as you sweep across the landscape of musicians in front of you.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I had no idea I would enjoy conducting an orchestra so much, but the game's brilliant mechanics make you instantly feel like an expert.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's mesmerizing enough to play on your own, but even watching someone else play feels truly inspiring. The game dropped its first DLC, Secret Sorcery, just after the new year and represents an impressive list of songs that include favorites from "Harry Potter," "Fantasia," and more classical composers.</p><p>And while the main game mainly relies on a catalog of classical songs, I promise you won't get bored if classical isn't normally your thing. What begins as a normal orchestra stage quickly transforms into anything from the streets of New York City — in very Broadway-stage fashion — to the backdrop of the French Revolution, with cannons booming and fireworks popping as you hit the notes.</p><p>It's a stunning game that everyone absolutely needs to play, and like I said before, there's a free demo to try first. If nothing, Eric de Roch's character was enough to get me interested in the tutorial, and the gameplay finished sucking me into the glorious atmosphere that awaited.</p>

<p>There's little doubt you've heard of Trombone Champ. The game launched in September 2022 to critical acclaim and was nominated for a BAFTA award. It spawned countless YouTube videos where content creators hilariously played the trombone as terribly as possible. Everyone, apparently, loved it.</p><p>So why would you want to play it again in VR? Because, this time, you're actually <em>playing</em> a trombone instead of just sliding a mouse or joystick up and down. You'll hold both controllers as if you're holding a physical trombone and slide your leading hand forward and backward to change notes.</p><p>While it uses a similar sliding note UI from the flat version, it's not right in front of your face. Instead, you'll find it placed at an angle going away from you so that the notes float forward, similar to other rhythm games. Being on both sides of the screen encourages more movement and makes it easier to see what's coming up next.</p>

<p>Physically sliding the tuning slide forward and backward is an incredibly fun and visceral mechanic. This gives you true control over the notes and makes it more fun to play than just tapping a joystick up and down. Because of it, you'll develop muscle memory over time, so playing each note feels authentically like playing a note from a real trombone.</p><p>Of course, this is where the "real" portion of the game stops and, quite frankly, why it's so much fun. Very little in the game is taken seriously, and it is absolutely a fun-first approach. Songs can be completed without playing a single note correctly, and while you won't score very well, you'll have a blast the whole way through.</p>

<p>Music selection is incredibly varied, featuring 58 tracks that encompass everything from classical to literal meme internet songs. But it doesn't stop there! The Lunar New Year update that just launched features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPa58uP4PvI">full custom song support</a> <em>in-headset</em>, which means you won't have to hook up a PC or do any modding to get your favorites in game. Eat your heart out, Beat Saber.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It's the best $15 you'll probably ever spend on the Quest store.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Progression is pretty standard rhythm game fare, but you can always free-play if you don't want to follow the required progression track. My favorite part of the progression is how the game requires you to earn specific collectible cards to unlock different trombones and other items.</p><p>Each collectible card is usually about a real composer, musician, instrument, or other musical item, but all of them have hilarious descriptions and artwork. The game is weirdly obsessed with hot dogs and always interjects hot dog-related humor into these cards. It's as bizarre as it sounds, but in keeping with the rest of the game's theme, it's pure comedy.</p><p>Custom trombones can also make custom sounds, so they do something more than just look cool or funny. Laughter is medicine for the soul, and it's clear my soul is pretty healthy after playing this game. I've never laughed so hard at any rhythm game before, and it's become a weekly "prescription" for me since its launch in November.</p><p>Seriously, it's the best $15 you'll probably ever spend on the Quest store.</p>

<hr>
<p>DeepSeek AI is the new bot on the block these days, and this Chinese AI model is going head-to-head with other U.S.-based AI companies.</p><p>While understanding how this large language model is gaining its skills, in a recent X post, AI analyst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=803X112721&xs=1&url=https://x.com/Dorialexander/status/1884167945280278857&xcust=4-1-2591529-1-0-0-0-0&sref=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2591529/deepseek-ai-confirmed-to-be-powered-by-a-huawei-chip.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alexander Doria</a> confirmed the chip that powers DeepSeek. Doria stated that DeepSeek’s R1 large-language model (LLM) was first trained using Nvidia’s H100 but now it fully functions on Huawei’s Ascend 910C chip to generate responses. (via Tech Advisor.)</p><p>Even though the 910C chip isn't as dominant as the Nvidia's H100, the  Chinese company wants to keep the chip domestic instead of going with U.S. based cores, reducing their reliability on expensive chips. Presumably, DeepSeek is testing its LLM to operate as good as it did on Nvidia chips.</p><p>"910C are (slightly) less performant and, even more importantly, does not come yet with a good interconnect which is critical for training," Doria added.</p><p>This could potentially bridge the gap between companies needing expensive chips that could power their AI models, functioning on par with big tech AI.  Additionally, Doria stated that DeepSeek might train its next AI model (V4) using  32,000 Huawei 910C chips. However, it remains to be seen how the Chinese chip maker will meet this demand, however 'chip independence' is something that the Chinese companies are working on, to help them become autonomous.</p><p>The DeepSeek R1 is a reasoning model that's built on the V3 large language model and is claimed to be developed at a fraction of the cost—  under $6 million to train its model. When compared to U.S. brands like ChatGPT that shelled out millions of dollars to create almost the same AI experience.</p><p>"The next chip, the 920c, is aiming for B200 performance (the current Nvidia flagship)."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I feel this should be a much bigger story: DeepSeek has trained on Nvidia H800 but is running inference on the new home Chinese chips made by Huawei, the 910C. pic.twitter.com/6IAgQlQ3ou<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884167945280278857">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Despite using a moderately powerful chip, DeepSeek's AI is outperforming U.S AI rivals like chat GPT AI model. For instance,  DeepSeek V3, has become extremely efficient at complex tasks like coding and essay writing.</p><p>DeepSeek's impact has already started to take effect as Nvidia, took a massive hit on Monday, losing $593 billion in market value as tech stocks tanked, marking the biggest one-day loss any company has ever seen on Wall Street.</p>

One of my all-time favorite MP3 players was the iRiver iFP-180T, pre-iPod, circa 2002. The Activo P1 I’ve been using for some time has iRiver roots, both owned by Korean parent company Dreamus. With that pedigree, the Activo P1 looks more like an iRiver project than something from the angular, metal builds of Astell & Kern’s luxury-priced DAP laboratory.</p><p>Despite looking more iRiver than Astell & Kern, what the Activo P1 doesn’t do is skimp on A&K quality in build or functionality. In a time where people are trying to minimize distractions, a DAP like this could fit into your life nicely as your everyday carry, wired or wireless, standalone music source, though that Google Play Store access may tempt you to add non-music apps.</p>

<p>Launched on July 22, 2024, the Activo P1 is available for $430, which may seem like a lot of money for a digital audio player. That price point is “accessible” when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/best-mp3-players">compare it to the cost of some of Astell & Kern’s other digital audio players</a> — I’ll refer to them as DAPs going forward — which can cost upwards of $1,000 or more.</p><p>It should be noted that the P1 is sold as the P1 by Astell & Kern in North America, in a few other regions, and on Amazon.com. In the UK, Germany, Japan, China, and other parts of the world, it is sold as the ACTIVO P1. The body, accessories, features, and firmware are the same regardless of the name and region. The only material difference will be the packaging.</p><p>So, what exactly do you get for $430? Cracking the box open gives a hint of the refinement on offer. You’ll find the P1, a screen protector, one short and one long USB-C cable, the warranty card, and some vouchers to check out Roon. The exterior feels sturdy — a solid build that feels great in hand, with aluminum for most of the body and white plastic polycarbonate at the top and bottom.</p><p>You’ll get multiple ways to enjoy your music as the DAP plays files locally from the 64GB of built-in storage or the microSD slot, which supports up to 1.5TB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD SDHC and SDXC cards</a>. Then there’s the Bluetooth 5.3 connection, which supports various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">audio codecs</a> such as aptX HD, LDAC, LHDC, and the lower-quality AAC and SBC formats.</p><p>Of course, it’s the wired connections that are the stars of this show, with the P1 supporting almost every “physical” file format from WAV to FLAC to ALAC and no shortage of playback and sampling rates with up to PCM 32bit/384kHz, MQA, and up to DSD256 native decoding.</p><p>All of this is powered by an octa-core CPU, an ESS SABRE ES9219Q dual DAC chip, A&K’s Teraton audio solution, and an A&K simplified version of Android. Your file streaming is powered by dual-band WiFi 5 support, so you’ll have no problems downloading larger files or streaming them over the internet or from your local network with Roon support.</p>

<p>A nice touch in the design department is the ability to control the player via physical buttons. You get volume controls on the left side, and play/pause on the right so if the screen is off you don’t need to wake the player to control your tunes.</p>

<p>To test the sound quality of this high-end DAP, I used Sennheieser’s HD660S2, Drop’s HiFiMan HE-4XX, Campfire Audio Mammoth IEMs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review">Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/noble-fokus-apollo-review">Noble’s FoKus Apollo</a> hybrid driver over-ears (a first in over-ear design). I used the 3.5mm, 4.4mm, and Bluetooth connections for playback.</p><p>I streamed from Tidal and Amazon Music’s hi-res collection. I also played MP3 files and FLAC files with native DSD decoding. I love how the P1’s built-in music player’s folder structure identifies your MQA, PCM, and DSD files under its MQS tab so that you can get right to them. I also used the P1 as a Bluetooth DAC and USB-C DAC, connected to my 2017 10-core iMac Pro, playing ALAC files from my Apple Music library.</p><p>After listening to 24bit/96kHz “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” by Paul Simon, 48kHz MQA “How Long Blues” by Ray Charles and Milt Jackson, 2.8MHz DSD “Thriller” and “Human Nature” by Michael Jackson, and 11.2MHz DSF “Wicked Game” by Aisyah, I was definitely impressed with the audio quality from that SABRE Dual-DAC augmented by Astell’s Teraton Alpha solution, found in its higher-priced DAPs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="jSNM8WLWrhTyym7T4KaYEJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-human-nature-mj.JPG" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 showing the stock music player, playing "Human Nature" by Michael Jackson" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSNM8WLWrhTyym7T4KaYEJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The stock sound is beautiful, entertaining, and engaging. It has tight reproduction at the bottom and restrained clarity at the top, so you’re not met with sibilance or shrill horns on tracks rendered with those qualities from more analytical DACs mated to equally analytical headphones or IEMs.</p><p>Despite the restraint in the high frequencies, the vocal mids don’t feel cramped at all, and voices that register into those higher frequencies, like that of Aisyah’s in “Wicked Game,” are delightfully airy and ethereal.</p><p>Listening to hip-hop tracks from The Roots, Kendrick Lamar, and the Beastie Boys, the bass attack with the Boom Bap should satisfy any bassheads reading this. That 808 resonance is delicious, but if the stock sound’s bass isn’t boomy enough for you, there’s a 20-band PEQ with Q-factor bandwidth adjustments to fix that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VQgDHLisBYwm88LrWhJpUg" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-shown-with-headphones-iems.JPG" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 with headphones, IEMs, and true wireless earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQgDHLisBYwm88LrWhJpUg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>USB and Bluetooth DAC modes don’t allow you to use the 20-band parametric EQ. Still, your wired or Bluetooth connection directly to headphones or IEMs does, and it’s a glorious playground for tailoring the sound curve to your “sonic palette.”</p><p>In one instance, I was listening to a pair of headphones that appeared to have some issues with the lows being super aggressive and masking higher-frequency sounds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="HGbKHQkvnfPG9vN8kkhzDJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-peq-main.JPG" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 showing 20-band parametric equalizer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HGbKHQkvnfPG9vN8kkhzDJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>I used the Q factor to adjust the bandwidth in the 45Hz and 60Hz bands and was able to mitigate most of that bass bleeding into the mids and masking the highs. This may not work well with a single-driver unit, but this pair utilizes a hybrid driver design, combining dynamic and planar drivers.</p><p>Just like anything, the P1 isn’t a magic bullet for sound. Listening to it via crappy headphones or IEMs isn’t going to give you the best results, considering what you’re paying for the DAP. With any setup, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie900-review">spend the most</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/wired-earbuds-are-making-a-comeback-and-im-excited">on your IEMs</a> or headphones <em><strong>first.</strong></em> <em>Then</em>, buy a DAC or DAP with what’s left in your budget.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life-2">Battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="5R4fuaw8qbUDEnyyaRRgEJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-battery-protection-mode.JPG" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 showing the Power and Battery menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5R4fuaw8qbUDEnyyaRRgEJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is definitely a DAP you can listen to for hours without it being fatiguing, and the 2,700mAh battery supports that. I have the battery saver turned on so that the Activo P1 stops charging at 85%. With the music set to 75% max volume and mixed-use, playing from local storage, and utilizing Wi-Fi to stream Tidal tracks, I drained that battery by 60% in seven hours.</p><p>If you drain the P1, it is PD 3.0-compatible for fast charging speeds. Using a 65-watt PD charger, I charged the unit to 85% from dead in one hour.</p>
<h2 id="improvements-for-the-next-gen-activo-p1-2">Improvements for the next-gen Activo P1</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="J6dgrywHDvChNYkaSaVbNJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-homescreen.JPG" alt="Astell&Kern Activo P1 home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6dgrywHDvChNYkaSaVbNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though the addition of Android to the Activo P1 makes the interface a bit faster and smoother than A&K’s in-house DAP OS, it can be a bit slow to boot, taking around 40 seconds most of the time. Once booted, the automatic scan of your local and microSD folders is lightning-fast.</p><p>With all of the headphones I used, I had to crank the volume, so you’re likely to run the battery down a bit quicker than the 20 hours of continuous playback that Astell & Kern advertises on its Activo website. Even with the most sensitive IEMs that I’ve used with multiple DACs and have to keep the volume quite low, I had to listen at 80% to 90% of max. The P1 has 150 steps of volume adjustment, and I regularly listened at 100-125 with closed-back and open-back headphones, respectively.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="eMdxheZeXwLsTLJWkSr7EJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-volume.JPG" alt="Astell & Kern Activo P1 volume control screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMdxheZeXwLsTLJWkSr7EJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not something that necessarily needs improving, but it is worth noting that the P1 does get warm to the touch after a while—not uncomfortably so, but it is noticeable.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-activo-p1-2">Should you buy the Activo P1?</h2>

<p>Unlike some of Astell & Kern’s pricier options, the Activo P1 is aimed at those looking for an everyday carry device that you won’t feel like you have to “white glove.” It has no water-resistance rating, so be mindful of that if you live in wetter climates. In wet or dry climates, I’d pick up a case, which can be difficult to find. Activo sells a white silicone case, and I’ve found a couple of PU leather cases on Amazon.</p><p>The Activo P1 is an excellent choice for a “do-everything” DAP that can also augment your computer or laptop-based listening sessions as a DAC if the price tag isn't an issue for you. For a “budget” Astell & Kern digital audio player, the Activo P1 doesn’t feel cheap or compromised.</p>

He further described 2025 as a "pivotal year for the metaverse" and teased the company launching more "visually stunning content" soon.</p><p>Zuckerberg also noted that 2025 is the year we'll truly understand if AI glasses are a truly viable long-term product category for the company. Meta is said to be launching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">a pair of Oakley-branded smart glasses</a> this year which should help further drive the product category. Reality Labs still operated at a loss this quarter, with operating expenses totaling nearly $5 billion.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg was positive about the company's leadership in open-source AI despite yesterday's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deepseek-ai-is-crushing-the-competition-and-triggering-an-ai-stock-bloodbath">DeepSeek AI launch</a> from China. The CEO noted that its open-source model standardized many supply chain assets and is working toward delivering a further revenue-positive approach throughout the year with multiple expected Llama 4-related AI products.</p><p>Meta will be launching "a new, more personalized AI" this year the company expects to reach 1 billion users by the year's end. Part of the new improvements will include additional memory length whereby Meta AI will be able to remember commands you've given it and be able to reference those, making it feel more like a personalized AI assistant rather than something you ask random questions to.</p><p>This new AI will be different in every region and dialect, helping to give it a more authentic feel rather than a generic AI question-and-answer bank. Zuckerberg also hyped the release of an "AI engineer" sometime in 2025 that will be able to operate with mid-level engineer capabilities. He said this AI engineer will be a "profound" release with potential market opportunities in 2026 and beyond.</p><p>The company teased 2025 as the year "we get back to the OG Facebook" but didn't offer much clarity beyond trying to restore Facebook to its original purpose. Instagram, Reels, WhatsApp, and Threads all grew and are expected to continue to grow throughout 2025, especially given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-tries-to-capitalize-on-tiktok-uncertainty-with-new-edits-app">uncertainty around TikTok</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy S25 pre-orders in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and the Middle East are starting to ship early, according to buyers.</li><li>The shipments not only have barcodes created, but also have been picked up by their couriers, which is a good sign they may deliver earlier.</li><li>Some users are seeing expected delivery dates as much as a week earlier than the official Feb. 7 release date.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung revealed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> last week, and pre-orders opened on Jan. 22. For early buyers, there was quite a while between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/three-reasons-to-preorder-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-through-samsung-and-one-reason-why-you-shouldnt">pre-orders opening</a> and the Feb. 7 official release date for the Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup. Those that are eagerly awaiting the delivery of their new flagships may have reason to be excited, because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS25/comments/1icycaf/delivery_update/" target="_blank">multiple Reddit users</a> are starting to see their orders shipping already (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2025/01/29/galaxy-s25-ultra-pre-orders-shipping-super-early/" target="_blank">Droid Life</a>).</p><p>It's not uncommon for buyers to receive early shipping notifications way before their phones are set to be delivered. Typically, Samsung shipping notifications are sent out when the label is created — which is sometimes days before a new phone is actually picked up by a courier. This time, however, multiple users are seeing their packages moving through shipping networks in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and the Middle East.</p><p>Other smartphone companies, like Apple, have strict polices with partners like UPS and FedEx that prevent packages from being delivered early. Even if a pre-order arrives at its final destination early, it'll often be held at a courier location until the official release date. Samsung, by comparison, has delivered new releases to buyers early — yet another indication that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">Galaxy S25</a> pre-orderers may have something to get excited about.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1ico7in/my_phone_just_shipped_as_well_im_so_excited">My phone just shipped as well! I'm so excited🤩</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy">r/samsunggalaxy</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>As a warning, not all Samsung Galaxy S25 buyers are seeing their orders move through a courier network just yet. Some are merely receiving shipping notifications that a label was created. Once the package has been picked up by a courier and you get an estimated delivery date, there's a good chance your Galaxy S25 could be delivered early. Until then, it might be worthwhile to hold off on the excitement.</p><p>Some people who have placed pre-orders, including at Droid Life, are seeing estimated delivery dates as early as tomorrow, Jan. 30. So, we'll know soon whether these early delivery dates are the real thing or just a tease. It's worth noting that only orders directly from Samsung are likely to ship and delivery early — orders from Best Buy, Amazon, and carriers will probably be held until the official Feb. 7 release date.</p><p>As Droid Life notes, this is one reason to pre-order through Samsung, in addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">promotions and enhanced trade-in values</a>. However, some have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/160jq86/14_day_returns_not_even_close_to_matching_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">expressed concerns with Samsung's return policy in the past</a>, so there are pros and cons.</p>

<p>Ever since Fossil abandoned Wear OS, the Android smartwatch space has had a distinct lack of style. Fossil had software issues it couldn't overcome, but its traditional watch designs were always on point, while Samsung, Google, and Apple barely even try to court the luxury watch crowd today. And I believe the time is right for more hybrid Android smartwatches to fill that gap!</p><p>Over the holidays, I held a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch fashion contest</a>, and it was a wake-up call. As someone immersed in tech for years, I'd grown accustomed to how smartwatches look. But when my non-techy relatives ranked watches from prettiest to ugliest, they crowned the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-2-review">Withings ScanWatch 2 hybrid</a> the best — and called the rest of the smartwatches boring at best and unwearable or ugly at worst.</p><p>Even though Android watches rarely use squircles, we've reached the point that it doesn't <em>matter</em> that they're circular; they still don't look like "watches." Recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watches</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watches</a> maximize display space, so they look like gadgets instead of accessories — especially the smaller models.</p><p>Even the "Classic"-style models are too large, thick, and glaringly bright to blend in. And so these brands have instead pushed in the opposite direction, giving up on "watch" designs and launching massive, expensive models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> — knowing that their core audience and credulous tech reviewers will happily accept it.</p><p>The problem is that this strategy does nothing for folks who want smarts <em>and</em> fashion. Hybrid watches come the closest, but they're hard to find and rarely strike the perfect balance between the two. I suspect that's why, when you look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/global-wearable-band-market-q3-2024">Canalys' 2024 worldwide wearable sales</a>, basic watches still outsell smartwatches by a wide margin.</p><p>Samsung is no stranger to experimenting with multiple watch models every year, and I know it'll likely return to its Classic design with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>. But I wish instead that it would try something new: reach outside of the tech nerd space and pick up where Fossil left off.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3993px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gPfXqysR7az8zRb2RfVerQ" name="Fossil-Gen-6-Hybrid-Wellness-Edition-review-menu.jpg" alt="The main menu on the Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gPfXqysR7az8zRb2RfVerQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3993" height="2246" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you make a hybrid smartwatch, do you focus more on smarts or the watch? Brands like Fossil, Garmin, and Withings have all made valiant efforts at this question, but I don't think any of them have really nailed the formula.</p><p>Fossil spent years as the main Wear OS option while other brands abandoned it, giving users access to different sub-brand styles — Michael Kors, Skagen Falster, Kate Spade, and so on — with Google's signature apps and assistant. Its lineup included several hybrid models, from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/skagen-jorn-hybrid-hr-review">Skagen Jorn</a> to the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-gen-6-hybrid-wellness-edition-review">Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness</a>.</p><p>Fossil couldn't keep up with the software after the Samsung/Google Wear OS merger and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-group-quits-making-smartwatches">gave up on Wear OS last year</a>, leaving a huge gap in the market. Still, Fossil watches were never perfect, with performance and battery life issues; and its hybrid models didn't even necessarily <em>use</em> Wear OS, with limited smarts and functionality without a positive trade-off like longer battery life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xFrUyeZGXaFzQbJYPGPxVo" name="skagen-jorn-hr-hybrid-smartwatch-skt3102.jpg" alt="Skagen Jorn Hybrid HR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFrUyeZGXaFzQbJYPGPxVo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Skagen Jorn HR hybrid </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skagen)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Withings ScanWatch 2, which has a tiny OLED cutout inside a normal steel interior, Fossil used subtle, eye-friendly e-ink screens that covered the entire hybrid watch face, giving you more room for information. But aside from obstructing watch hands, you had to reckon with E Ink's slow refresh rate when scrolling through long notifications or menus. It was only best suited for static information.</p><p>Withings' tiny-display strategy pays off with longer battery life and a design that looks eminently "normal" when you aren't receiving notifications. If you want a watch that tracks your health data but wouldn't look out of place in a business environment, the ScanWatch 2 or its more expensive siblings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-nova-announced">ScanWatch Nova</a> are where I'd start.</p><p>Still, the ScanWatch 2's tiny screen barely fits any data, making reading notifications annoying. More importantly, for this discussion, you're mostly wearing this watch for health and sleep data. It's much more limited than what you're used to with a traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a>, with no apps or Assistant.</p><p>I also reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Garmin Vivomove Trend</a>, which looks surprisingly stylish from a brand that's well-known for its thick, sporty designs. However, the Trend had issues with a finicky touchscreen and slow performance, which seems to be a trend (no pun intended) with hybrid watches.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-d-want-out-of-a-wear-os-hybrid-smartwatch-2">What I'd want out of a Wear OS hybrid smartwatch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GVmCtt8AGjyFTU2VxA6QXH" name="scanwatch-nova-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova press photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GVmCtt8AGjyFTU2VxA6QXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The ScanWatch Nova looks more naturally watch-like but can't fit much data on its tiny screen </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Withings)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I suspect a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> owners don't actually use apps all that often. They want on-wrist calling, voice commands, actionable notifications, and health insights. They'd also presumably like longer battery life than the 1–2 days they typically get!</p><p>What I think could work is an actual hybrid <em>version</em> of Wear OS, the same way Google made a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-and-google-teamed-up-on-new-galaxy-watch-7-experience-for-kids">kid-friendly Wear OS for Galaxy Watches</a>. It could have a limited number of core Google apps and major third-party options — such as Gemini, Google Maps, Wallet, Messages, and music apps like YouTube Music and Spotify, for starters — that would each use a stripped-down UI to work on a smaller grayscale or E Ink screen.</p><p>We're getting closer and closer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">Gemini on Wear OS</a>, and I think that would be essential for an experience like this. You could tell the watch assistant to map you to a nearby coffee shop and have the next step and directional arrow pop up on a low-res screen. The same goes if you tell it to start a playlist and check the song metadata or ask it to pull up your Google Home controls; the idea is to have as little touch navigation as possible because it's harder to look through an app drawer without any color.</p>

<p>Even if we just got a fully health and fitness-focused watch like the ScanWatch 2 that sends your heart, blood oxygen, stress, ECG, and skin temperature data directly to Fitbit or Samsung Health, I bet a lot of people would buy into that option and eschew the extra Google smarts that burn through battery life.</p><p>Of course, Google and Samsung already make long-lived watches, but they're sporty, cheap squircles like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-tracker-finally-comes-to-us">Galaxy Fit 3</a> or the old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a>. They have their place for budget hunters, but there's no reason why we can't get the Fit 3's tech inside a steel watch with some actual class, even if it costs much more.</p><p>And that brings me to my other point about these hybrids: I don't want Samsung and Google designing them! Fossil had the expertise to create beautiful smartwatches and was only held back by the software. Google and Samsung have software expertise in abundance, but they need outside help on the physical side.</p><p>Just like Meta put its smart glasses tech inside of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Bans</a>, and soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">Oakleys</a>, Google and Samsung could employ the help of well-known luxury watch brands to launch their simplified version of Wear OS Think Rolex, Cartier, Omega, Patek Philippe, and so on! Heck, if Ultrahuman can sell a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-rare-luxury-smart-ring-with-premium-materials-massive-price">$1,500 luxury smart ring</a> in department stores, you'd think Samsung and Google could pull it off!</p><p>We've already seen luxury Wear OS watches from Tag Heuer, Montblanc, and (obviously) Fossil, but all with AMOLED displays that could only look like pale imitations of watch faces to their discerning customers — plus a lack of experience with software updates.</p><p>If it's Samsung (or Google) building the software experience, then we'll at least know these hybrid watches will get years of speedy software support instead of being immediately abandoned. And by going all-in on hybrid designs, Wear OS will be the "mature" brand for serious adults while Apple Watches remain known for their kiddy squircles.</p>

<ul><li>The Google Pixel 9a will debut on March 26, with pre-orders opening a week prior, according to a report from Android Headlines.</li><li>This is over a month earlier than the Pixel 8a released last year, but it follows Google's recent shift toward earlier release windows.</li><li>The Pixel 9a's base model is expected to cost the same $499 as its predecessor, with the 256GB configuration retailing for $599.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We've seen two top Android midrangers debut over the last few months, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>. Now, the highly-anticipated Google Pixel 9a will soon join those midrange devices in just a few months, according to a new report. Expected to bring a refreshed design with no camera bar and the same $499 starting price tag, the Pixel 9a could be a budget alternative to the pricier aforementioned midrangers.</p><p>A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9a-release-date" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> now claims the Google Pixel 9a will debut in March, with pre-orders for the device opening on March 19. The device will start shipping and become available in stores beginning March 26. Android Headlines' report cites an anonymous source for the Pixel 9a's release date, and the publication has a track record of accuracy.</p><p>The Pixel 9a's expected March release date is earlier in the year than the current Pixel 8a debuted in 2024. Google released the Google Pixel 8a in May last year, around the time of its Google I/O developer conference. However, Google also shifted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>' release date forward last year, and it makes sense for the Pixel 9a to follow suit. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O's greater focus on AI</a> rather than Android and smartphones could be another reason for the change.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1415px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.83%;"><img id="Ri5t9SatZcsjr9hhZCJW7X" name="google-pixel-9a-alleged-renderings-leaning.jpg" alt="A supposed rendering of the Pixel 9a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ri5t9SatZcsjr9hhZCJW7X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1415" height="790" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A rumored rendering of the Google Pixel 9a, now believed to debut in March 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a's competitors are more expensive than the Pixel 8a was, leading some to believe that the Pixel 9a could get a price hike as well. As it turns out, the latest leaks and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-storage-options-leak">reports predict that is — and isn't — something to worry about</a>. The base-model Pixel 9a with 128GB of storage is rumored to cost $499, just like last year.</p><p>However, the upgraded Pixel 9a configuration with 256GB of storage will retail for $599, which is a $40 increase compared to the current model, per the report. This could be the configuration most Pixel 9a buyers go for, as there's no way to upgrade the storage after purchase and 128GB is getting thin in 2025.</p><p>If anything, this report suggests we'll learn more about the Google Pixel 9a ahead of its expected March 2025 release. Rumors and leaks typically pick up as an announcement date gets closer, before the eventual official reveal.</p>

<hr>
<p>Happy Lunar New Year; Google is highlighting its latest Doodle as we ring in another year.</p><p>The company has published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doodles.google/doodle/lunar-new-year-2025/">Year of the Snake Doodle</a> page to celebrate the Lunar New Year and festivities in Asia (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lunar-new-year-doodle-3520946/">Android Authority</a>). Google runs users through a brief history about the Lunar New Year and why it's been so heavily celebrated for "over 3,000 years." As always, users may be familiar with the bright, passionate red that the Lunar New Year brings.</p><p>The company states that residents often clean their homes before adding touches of red. This color typically symbolizes good fortune and prosperity.</p><p>Moreover, the Lunar New Year is a time for friends and family to gather over a wonderful feast. Google says the celebrations often feature "traditional favorites" like fish, chicken, dumplings, mandarin oranges, and other mouth-watering goodness. Also, stepping into Chinese mythology, the New Year is often rife with fireworks and firecrackers, but it's more than just a loud hoorah into 2025.</p><p>The brief story glances over the mythology of Nian, a fierce beast from ancient China. It's said that the beast hated loud noises, thus the reason the Lunar New Year is packed with firey explosions in the sky of multiple colors.</p><p>We've stepped into 2025, the Year of the Snake. Those born in 1989, 2001, 2013, and 2025 all belong to the snake. If any of these years are yours, then Google says this is your time for "growth, creativity, and transformation."</p><p>Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://g.co/kgs/kUuLcfb">go to google.com</a> and search for Year of the Snake to enjoy a cute retro game.</p>

<p>Also, those in South Korea are also celebrating a Lunar New Year. So, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doodles.google/doodle/lunar-new-year-2025-south-korea/">Happy Seollal</a> to everyone in South Korea or who celebrate this time of year, as well.</p><p>Google is pretty quiet right now in terms of reveals, but it is busy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">developing the next major OS</a>: Android 16. The company recently dropped its first beta for interested testers with Pixel phones. Users can enroll to begin sifting through what's new and what's still planned for release.</p><p>The first beta introduced "Live Updates" to Pixels alongside some interesting video recording updates for Android.</p><p>Elsewhere, it seems that we could expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">some form of Qi2</a> to arrive on Google's future Pixel devices in 2025. The WPC (World Power Consortium) posted the details of its simpler "Qi2 Ready" method for Android devices this year. Phones that are Qi2 Ready will support the necessary tech <em>inside </em>for wireless charging with support for external accessories outside the phone. Google stated that it would join Samsung is delivering Qi2 Ready devices, but it might look a little different.</p><p>The company didn't <em>commit </em>to Qi2. What it said was that it would further the standard and help progress the next version, known as Qi v2.2.</p>

<hr>
<p>Right before the Galaxy S25 lands in consumer hands, Samsung has reportedly dropped a new accessory you might not want to miss.</p><p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/magnetic-wallet-gp-tou024sagbw/">now listed</a> its official Magnetic Wallet accessory for the Galaxy S25 series (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/29/samsung-launches-30-magnetic-wallet-for-galaxy-s25-ships-before-the-required-cases/#more-659267">9to5Google</a>). The product features the Qi2 connection ring at the top portion of the accessory and only comes in black. Samsung's store listing states users can purchase the Magnetic Wallet at a discounted price of $14.99.</p><p>The publication claims the accessory will "generally" go for $29.99.</p><p>The user-facing part of the wallet is where you'll store your important cards and other necessities when traveling.</p><p>It's unclear when Samsung will begin taking orders/shipping the Magnetic Case. The company displays the expected price, but there's only a "Notify Me" button available, instead of one to purchase. However, the publication claims that Samsung is "shipping this wallet now" and that it should arrive once consumers' pre-ordered Galaxy S25s reach home.</p><p>Regardless, users should sign up for email notifications so you're in the loop about this attachment.</p>

<p>Samsung officially stepped into the world of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">the Qi2 standard earlier in January</a>, a few weeks ahead of the Galaxy S25's reveal. The company confirmed via a press release that its Galaxy devices in 2025 will come with Qi2 support. Joining the WPC's (World Power Consortium) standard for Android brings 15W wireless charging and magnetic alignment to Samsung's phones.</p><p>While Android OEMs have struggled to adopt Qi2 properly, the WPC brought about a new branding called "Qi2 Ready." Essentially, devices that are Qi2 Ready will feature the required tech inside for wireless charging alongside support for external magnetic connections on the outside for accessories.</p><p>The WPC states that it's ready for an "acceleration in Android devices with Qi2 built in during 2025." Samsung will be accompanied by Google in producing Qi2 Ready devices this year. Google is going to go about bringing this support in its own way, so we'll have to see what happens.</p><p>With the Galaxy S25 series on the way (if you pre-ordered), users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">can begin looking</a> for some of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">the best cases</a> to protect their new tech-baby.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Tuesday, Google announced that it would be taking steps to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on Google Maps in the U.S. on its Google Maps platform.</p><p>For people in Mexico, the name will stay the same; however, for the US, it will be renamed as above.</p><p>“We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google">Google</a> in a post on X. This change comes after Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20, keeping a part of his campaign promise.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884012692048166951">January 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>As directed by the President, the Gulf of Mexico will now officially be known as the Gulf of America, and North America's highest peak will once again bear the name Mount McKinley," Trump's Interior Department said in a statement last week (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/google-maps-rename-gulf-mexico-gulf-america-us-users-2025-01-27/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>).</p><p>In the same X post, the tech giant said that once the Geographic Names Information System(GNIS) is updated, Google Maps will also reflect the name changes. GNIS maintains working relationships with the federal authorities and the government to "standardize geographic names for Federal use."</p><p>Google added that when there are varied names for the same place, the people residing in the local area will see the name designated to that country, while the rest of the world will see both options.</p><p>The company also said Maps will rename Denali back to Mount McKinley, which was changed during Barak Obama's presidency, paying tribute to the Alaskan natives.</p><p>It remains unknown when these changes will start showing up on Google Maps, as the company didn't give us the exact date that this will go into effect. Android Central has reached out to Google in this regard and will update the article when we have more information.</p>

The leak comes from X user @gadget_bits (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/28/nothing-phone-3a-specs-leak/">Gizmochina</a>). The device is likely to bear the A059 model number and be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> SoC—the same chipset that powered the recent Redmi Note 14 Pro.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨 ExclusiveNothing Phone (3a)Model number A059- Snapdragon 7s Gen 3- 6.8" FHD+ AMOLED 120hz display - 50mp +50mp 2x telephoto +8mp UW- 32mp front- 5000mAh battery- 45W fast charging- NFC, Glyph lights- Nothing OS 3.1 based on Android 15Worldwide launch on March 4 pic.twitter.com/1ixtDGmGzl<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884176023409004752">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The upcoming Phone 3a is also expected to feature a 6.8-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-or-phone-3a-could-be-coming-on-march-4">recent launch teaser</a> reveals a triple camera visor accompanied by a new glyph interface. The cameras, per the leak, indicate a 50MP primary sensor next to another 50MP telephoto sensor and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens.</p><p>For selfies, however, we can expect a 32MP camera.</p><p>Other (rumored) key specs for the Phone 3a include a 5000mAh battery capacity and 45W fast charging support. NFC, alongside the Glyph interface on the back, is also expected. The device will likely ship with Android 15-based Nothing OS 3.1 out of the box.</p>
<p>While the leak indicates that it could be a solid mid-range phone on paper, Nothing’s signature design elements are likely to add more value and variety to the segment. We expect more details to pop up right ahead of the March 4 launch event, and we also anticipate Nothing’s sub-brand CMF’s products to showcase alongside the Phone 3a — considering the company following last year’s launch pattern.</p><p>Nothing launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> next to a couple of CMF products around the same time last year — right around the Mobile World Congress event.</p>

It offers 1080p resolution, which is more than enough for most casual TV watchers, and the newer iteration of the Lite also comes with access to Alexa voice controls that can easily be used to control other Amazon smart home devices. It's also lightweight and portable enough for travel, making it a perfect packable solution for business trips and vacations alike.</p>

The package includes both the receiver and the Amazon Alexa Voice Remote Lite, offering a perfect easy-to-use solution for anyone with Wi-Fi, an HD TV, and credentials for one or more music and TV streaming services. Those who don't can still take advantage of the included free channels, as well as easy access to Alexa smart home voice controls. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-lite-latest-alexa-voice-remote-lite/dp/B091G4YP57" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="649e9074-f05c-4c15-aaa8-68c1bbbe9ea6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want an easy plug-and-play solution for accessing streaming services; you'd rather have a lightweight, portable TV option than cable boxes, gaming consoles, or other media devices; you're already a user of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a> within the Amazon ecosystem.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-new-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-soundbar-announced">Fire TV Stick that can stream in 4K</a>; you want the latest in Amazon's AI tech.</p><p>The great thing about Amazon's lineup of Fire TV Sticks is that they're simple to use. Owners just plug the HDMI receiver into their TV and into a wall charger with a micro-USB port, both included, and they're ready to watch. The Fire TV Stick Lite is no different, ringing in at Amazon's most budget-friendly price—and even more so with this discount.</p><p>The Fire TV Stick Lite and base-level Fire TV Stick both offer 1080p resolution, so those wanting 4K will need to upgrade to Amazon's three other options: the Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire TV Stick 4K Max, or Fire TV Cube. Additionally, the 4K lineup also includes Amazon's generative AI-powered FireTV experience, but really the Fire TV Stick Lite gets the job done.</p><p>The main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-vs-fire-tv-stick-lite">difference between the regular Amazon Fire TV Stick and the TV Stick Lite </a>is that this version isn't capable of controlling power or volume on other TVs, soundbars, or receivers, and that the non-lite version normally retails for $40 rather than $30. Otherwise, they're pretty much identical, so it might be worth jumping on this 40% off deal while it's available if external device control isn't a dealbreaker for you.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's new mid-range phone's launch looks like it's just around the corner. A recent Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group) certification revealed that a device with model number "<strong>SM-A566B_DS</strong>,"<strong> </strong>aka Samsung Galaxy A56 5G, was sent in for a Bluetooth Qualification Process (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-bluetooth-sig-certification/" target="_blank">Smartprice</a>). This hints that the phone is set for release at the end of Q1, which seems similar to the Galaxy A55 model that was released in March last year.</p><p>While we have little to no information on the specs of the device so far, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a56-13603.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a> gave us a full "unofficial" spec sheet of the phone based on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/fcc_docs_confirm_that_the_samsung_galaxy_a56_will_support_45w_charging-news-66269.php">FCC document</a>. According to the publication, the device is said to have a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, a tad larger than its predecessor, with a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels, 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR10+ with a brightness of 1000 nits. The screen will be protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus Plus and have an always-on display.</p><p>In November last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a56-renders-leak">full renders of the phone</a> were shown off by prominent tipster @Onleaks. The phone looked a lot like its predecessor in the images, featuring flat edges and rounded corners.</p><p>GSMArena's listing states that the device will retain the same camera specs as its predecessor, i.e., a 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide camera along with a 5MP macro camera that is said to be stacked vertically. The phone will also have a 12MP selfie camera. These cameras are said to support 4K video recording at 30fps and 1080p 30/60fps.</p>

<p>While there were rumors last year about the device's charging speed, now, FCC documents retrieved by the publication all but confirm that the device will feature 45W wired fast charging just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> (and notably faster than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a>). The publication also states that the model is expected to be powered by the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/exynos_1580_unveiled_with_cortexa720_cores_double_the_gpu_hardware-news-65051.php">Exynos 1580</a> chipset and a 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>Two leaks suggest that it could come with the new One UI 7, indicating that the device could come packed with more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which will be supported by Android 15 right out of the box. The publication further adds that the phone will come in Black and other colorways with  8/12GB RAM and 256GB storage.</p><p>However, since these are still leaks and speculations, they have to be taken with a grain of salt as we are yet to receive official confirmation from Samsung on the specs of the device. That said, it may not be long before the phone is officially unveiled.</p>

<ul><li>The Google Play Store is encountering an annoying crash seemingly without cause on Android.</li><li>Reports claim the app is delivering a "keeps stopping" error message, a classic popup when an app unexpectedly closes, on phones and tablets.</li><li>While Google has yet to formally acknowledge this issue, the most recent update for the Play Store involves Verified badges for VPNs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's app store is encountering an issue on Android devices that's hampering user experiences.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/28/google-play-store-stopping/">9to5Google</a>, the publication reports that the Google Play Store is encountering an annoying wave of crashes on Android. The crash doesn't appear to have vastly negative effects on the system's overall software (like a lockout/system freeze). What's been reported is an app error message, which states the following: "Google Play Store keeps stopping."</p><p>Anyone who's experienced an app crash on their Android device will recognize this quick message. Users are left with no choice but to close the app and re-open it in hopes that it doesn't become too frequent.</p><p>Google has yet to formally acknowledge these issues, likely because it's not affecting a <em>vast </em>majority of its users — not yet, anyway.</p><p>The post adds that the crash has happened on smartphones and tablets, such as the Pixel Tablet. The publication also reports that it's encountered the Play Store's crash "several times" in the "past 24 hours."</p><p>At the time of writing, we've not encountered an app error with the Play Store in testing via a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Moto Edge Plus 2023</a> or a base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motor Razr 2023</a>. Fortunately, the crashes don't impact the core functions of the store like downloading/installing. For now, if this is happening you and your device, waiting for a backend fix is likely your next course of action.</p><p>The Play Store hasn't had any <em>major </em>updates recently, aside from Google's introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-verified-marks-vpn-security-announcement">Verified badges</a> for "trusted" VPNs. The company detailed in a press release yesterday (Jan 28) that these badges are for companies with VPNs that have undergone an independent security review alongside displaying a committment to securing a user's data safely. These badges are arriving first for NordVPN, hide.me, and Aloha.</p><p>Others can begin taking the necessary steps for such verification.</p><p>Also, toward the end of last year, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ditches-share-apps-nearby-share-play-store">ditched the "Share Apps"</a> feature from the Play Store. The function worked thanks to Android's Nearby Share protocol, which lets users send an app over the air to a friend or family member's device for download. With it gone, we're back to sharing links — which isn't too bad.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has an interesting promotional offer in the U.K. for Galaxy S25 series buyers.</li><li>The company is offering a free "starter kit" with the purchase of a Galaxy S25 device in the region.</li><li>It includes a free case and charger, but users should submit a review of the device after the proposed return period to receive the gift.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s latest Galaxy S25 series is now available for preorder across several regions after a successful launch last week. The company is also offering a free starter kit in select countries, which includes a Samsung official case and a charger worth £128.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/27/samsung-giving-away-official-galaxy-s25-case-in-uk/#more-659081">9to5Google</a>, the current offer is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/?utm_source=Andrew+Romero&utm_medium=narrativ&utm_campaign=ju8olliq7vq8u&cid=opmc-ecomm-nrtiv-000-042720-000000-Andrew+Romero-ouefk6c5qi27z&nrtv_as_src=1&nrtv_cid=ouefk6c5qi27z&offerCID=reserve&btn_ref=srctok-f2b401cf4af586b0">available</a> in the U.K. region and is valid for the purchase of the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Users would need to preorder either of the devices only through the Samsung U.K. website from January 22 to February 6.</p>

<p>There is a 14-day return window for users who select the offer, post which Samsung will send an email with a link that further redirects to a review form. Users who placed the order will have 30 days from the date of delivery (of their respective Galaxy S25 device) to review their handset using the respective link.</p><p>After they submit their reviews, users won’t immediately get a confirmation email; rather, their reviews will get validated in the next 30 days after which they will be getting the aforementioned gift which likely includes a Samsung Standing Grip case and a 15W Duo charger, according to images seen on the offer page.</p>
<p>Colorways of the respective products that are being gifted may differ from the showcased image on the offer page. Users also have to bear in mind that each order is eligible for only one gift, and the email that is being used should be the same as that being used while purchasing any of the Galaxy S25 models.</p><p>Samsung has traditionally incorporated different kinds of launch offers every year during the launch of its flagship Galaxy S series. For instance, in the U.S., there is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-new-galaxy-club-program-for-galaxy-25-series">“New Galaxy Club” program</a> for users interested in buying the Galaxy S25 series. Users who purchase a Galaxy S25 series device are eligible to opt for this additional subscription to help them upgrade their device next year.</p><p>For instance, users who buy a Galaxy S25 Ultra or S25 Plus will need to additionally pay $8.33 a month for 12 months, after which they can opt for the successor model at a discounted price of up to 50%. The new program alongside existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">preorder deals for Galaxy S25</a> is a bonus, to say the least.</p>

Version 3.144 was spotted by a Reddit user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/27/pixel-buds-pro-2-first-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Unveiled with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series in August of last year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> hit the shelves by late September. The Pixel phones have received several software updates since then, but the earbuds have been left out—until now.</p><p>The first update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, spotted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/pixelbuds/comments/1ibusag/new_firmware_update_3144/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a>, bumps the firmware to version 3.144. Google hasn’t made an official announcement or shared a changelog yet, so we’re not sure what’s new.</p>

<p>While the update details are still under wraps, users have reported occasional disconnections in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/thread/320560541?hl=en&msgid=320565198" target="_blank">community forum</a>. As 9to5Google pointed out, a Product Expert responded to these issues, hinting that another update was on the way.</p><p>Along with the disconnection issues, some users have run into a bit of a snag with the volume controls. Apparently, the volume rocker or slider on their phones isn’t doing the trick, and only the controls on the earbuds themselves seem to work.</p><p>Even with some ongoing issues similar to the previous model, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 still stands out as a top choice for Android users.</p><p>The update is presumably rolling out in stages, so it might not show up right away for all Pixel Buds Pro 2 users. As per 9to5, the whole process takes about 10 minutes and happens in two parts: first, the update downloads while you're using the earbuds, and then it installs once you put them back in the charging case.</p><p>To see if an update is available, go to More settings > Firmware update in the Device details/companion app.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-97">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Eufy removed a blog post announcing Find My Device trackers from its website, suggesting it won't be making SmartTrack for Android devices.</li><li>The brand first quietly changed its target launch window from "June 2024" to "late 2024."</li><li>While some Google and Eufy pages reference the brand's Find My Device trackers, all other mentions are gone for good.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Eufy appears to have shelved plans for a Find My Device item tracker for good, as the company removed a press release announcing the SmartTrack Link and SmartTrack Card for Android from its website. The change was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/28/eufy-find-my-device-trackers-android-deleted/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, and appears to have occurred last month, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241129034025/https://www.eufy.com/blogs/smart-tracker/eufy-tracker-works-with-google-find-my-device" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> archive data.</p><p>Although some Eufy and Google webpages still reference the brand's to-be-released Find My Device trackers, the removal of Eufy's main press release suggests that it no longer plans to release the previously-announced devices. Originally intended as new additions to Eufy's popular SmartTrack lineup of personal item trackers, the SmartTrack Link for Android and SmartTrack Card for Android never saw the light of day. Eufy was one of five <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> partners Google announced with the network last year, joined by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-joins-google-find-my-device-tracker-debut">Chipolo</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/pebblebee-clip-review">Pebblebee</a>, Jio, and Motorola.</p><p>When the Find My Device-compatible variants of the Eufy SmartLink trackers were revealed in April 2024, Eufy planned to launch them in June 2024. Then, when the brand that target missed, the blog post's wording was changed to say that the trackers were coming in "late 2024."</p><p>Sometime in December 2024, the blog post was taken down from Eufy's website. The original link now redirects to Eufy's homepage. Although at least one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.eufy.com/s/article/What-should-I-do-if-I-cannot-find-my-phone-using-my-SmartTrack-Card-Link" target="_blank">support document</a> acknowledging the Find My Device network remains, the removal of the blog post suggests the SmartTrack Link for Android and SmartTrack Card for Android won't ever ship.</p>

<p>Eufy hasn't publicly commented on the state of its SmartTrack Link for Android and SmartTrack Card for Android trackers since they were announced. Despite quietly changing the trackers' launch window on the blog post and subsequently removing it entirely, Eufy didn't provide any updates.</p><p>The uncertainty regarding Eufy's planned item trackers continue the underwhelming nature of Google's Find My Device launch. There are limited products available, and our own testing revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">it could take days for lost Find My Device trackers to have their location updated on the network</a>. For now, it appears Eufy is canning plans to expand the market for Find My Device trackers with SmartTrack for Android devices.</p>

I&apos;ve been monitoring these offers since preorders went live last week, and I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s938uakexaa/"><strong>buying the Galaxy S25 Ultra directly through Samsung</strong></a> might be the best move for most folks. Of course, the deals on display may not be for everyone, so let&apos;s break down the pros and cons of preordering through Samsung. </p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is a super-powered smartphone with a glorious 6.9-inch QHD+ display, custom Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and some of the most groundbreaking AI features found on any Android phone to date. </p>
<p>Preordering the Galaxy S25 Ultra through Samsung guarantees you up to $900 off when you trade in an old or broken device, plus you'll get a free storage upgrade, some additional Samsung credit, and more.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s938uakexaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="aa3b314e-c89e-46e7-be9c-0de379f06877" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,419.99" data-dimension48="$1,419.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<h2 id="reason-1-the-trade-in-credit-2">Reason #1: The trade-in credit</h2>
<p>Samsung is offering up to $900 of trade-in credit when you preorder the Galaxy S25 Ultra through the official site, and it&apos;s being pretty generous with the devices it accepts. Both the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Z Fold 5 will get you the full discount, while slightly older phones like the Galaxy S23 Plus and even the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra will land you $600 of credit to apply to your purchase. </p><p>Sure, some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25 preorder deals</a> may offer a bigger trade-in discount, but they&apos;re typically coming from phone companies that require you to add a line to your wireless service. That may work for some folks, but if you want a simple, no-strings discount, Samsung has those other retailers beat. Play your cards right and you could get this premium smartphone for as little as $399.99. </p>

<h2 id="reason-2-the-free-stuff-2">Reason #2: The free stuff</h2>
<p>Preordering the Galaxy S25 Ultra directly from Samsung gets you a free storage boost at no additional cost. That means that you could get the 512GB phone for the price of the 256GB model, or 1TB of storage for the price of the 512GB. You&apos;ll also get a free Samsung credit worth up to $110 (depending on whether or not you signed up for the Galaxy Reserve program before preorders went live). </p><p>This bit of cash can be used at Samsung.com to buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">Galaxy S25 Ultra cases</a> and other cool accessories, and it&apos;s just automatically added to your purchase with zero hassle. If you buy the 256GB version of the phone, you&apos;ll also be eligible to get a free pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> earbuds (usually $249.99) when you bundle, but more on that below. </p><p>As if those rewards weren&apos;t enough, Samsung will also hook you up with three free months of Peacock Premium and SiriusXM streaming, plus two months of Adobe Lightroom. </p><p><strong>Bonus: </strong>this isn&apos;t exactly a free thing, but it&apos;s worth mentioning that buying through Samsung is also the only way to get access to the exclusive Titanium color variants. </p>
<h2 id="reason-3-the-bundles-2">Reason #3: The bundles</h2>
<p>If you were hoping to get a few Galaxy devices in one fell swoop, Samsung&apos;s preorder deals should not be missed. In the market for a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-how-we-test">Android smartwatch</a>? Add the Galaxy Watch 7 or Galaxy Watch Ultra to your preorder and you&apos;ll get a 61% or 69% discount, respectively, when you buy the 512GB phone. </p><p>Like I mentioned above, preordering the 256GB device will get you a free pair of Samsung earbuds, but you can also get up to 92% off the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro if you opt for a different storage configuration. The exact discounts will always depend on the amount of storage you buy, so play around with the different options to find the deal that works for you. </p>

<h2 id="on-the-other-hand-2">On the other hand..</h2>
<p>I would only recommend buying the Galaxy S25 Ultra through Samsung if you&apos;re prepared to do a trade-in. If you simply want to buy the phone unlocked, skip Samsung and check out the preorder deals from Amazon or Best Buy (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-256gb-titanium-black-verizon/6612779.p"><strong>where you can get a free $200 gift card</strong></a>).</p><p>It&apos;s also worth checking with your wireless carrier to see if they can get you a better deal. Preordering through Verizon, for instance, could save you some serious cash, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/the-best-atandt-deals-of-month-year-up-to-dollar1000-off-galaxy-s24-ultra-free-flagships-and-more">AT&T&apos;s deals</a> might even get you the phone for free with an eligible trade-in and new line. </p><p>Buying a new phone can be a tricky business, and with the Galaxy S25 Ultra&apos;s steep price tag, it&apos;s reasonable to be a little cautious. My advice would be to look around before you commit to a single deal, but if you&apos;re planning to ditch an old device, Samsung deserves a closer look than most. </p>

<ul><li>Samsung has reportedly removed all references to a Bluetooth S Pen for the Galaxy S25 Ultra following user confusion.</li><li>The company previously stated one was available and "sold separately;" however, that was not the case.</li><li>Samsung likely removed the Air Controls of its S Pen in 2025 after it stated less than 1% of its users with the S24 Ultra actually used them.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is doing a bit of damage control as its official news channels retract a previous S Pen statement.</p><p>After some conflicting information, Samsung has reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://insights.samsung.com/2025/01/24/how-to-boost-productivity-with-the-s-pen-on-your-galaxy-s25-ultra/">removed</a> its false Bluetooth S Pen feature section from a blog post (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/28/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-bluetooth-s-pen-post-deleted/">9to5Google</a>). As reiterated by the publication, Samsung's Insight post originally detailed a seventh "How to boost productivity" bullet point. This point highlighted the ability for users to utilize "Set Guestures" via a "Bluetooth-enabled S Pen," which was supposedly "sold separately."</p><p>The company's post explained that users could "press the button" on the side of the stylus to produce its Air Gestures. These gestures made it easy for users to prop their phone up in one place and use the pen to take photos and more.</p><p>Fast-forward to today and Samsung has removed all mentions of a Bluetooth-ready S Pen for the Galaxy S25 Ultra and its alleged availability for purchase.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2498px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="3P2KT5JTZZXouH5Ab5Cfoj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-s-pen-angled-view-close-up" alt="Angled view of all four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors with S Pens unsheathed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3P2KT5JTZZXouH5Ab5Cfoj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2498" height="1404" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung jumped on things quickly, especially after users discovered the post and started passing it around — though, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mixed-reports-about-a-separate-bluetooth-s-pen-for-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-have-fans-puzzled">reactions were mixed</a>. What matters worse was that, despite Samsung's reference to a Bluetooth S Pen, none of its official listings showed one for sale. The company only offered up its standard S Pen and the S Pen Pro for purchase.</p><p>Then, the company's wires were crossed as an executive informed another publication that the S Pen Pro was "compatible" with the Bluetooth/Air Controls — but that proved to be false, too.</p><p>With Samsung removing any mention of this ghost Bluetooth S Pen for the Galaxy S25 Ultra with Air Control support, perhaps that's the official confirmation we need. However, considering the odd mention and the following damage control, it makes us think that maybe this <em>is </em>on the way, but it just slipped out too soon.</p><p>It's a far-out-there hope. Instead, we should take a moment and ponder: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">does it really matter</a>? It seems like Samsung's removal of the S Pen's Bluetooth functions/Air Controls is a product of its cost-cutting procedures. A little less tech, a little less money to sink into things. Moreover, the company explained that less than 1% of its users <em>actually </em>used its Air Control features via the old S Pen. Android Central's Andrew Myrick did the math and that comes out to about 158,000 users with the Galaxy S24 Ultra that utilized the S Pen's gestures.</p><p>It's a shocking number considering Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1874802229586366801">sold 15.8 million</a> Galaxy S24 Ultra units between January and November 2024.</p>

<ul><li>Honor is drawing attention to its "playful" campaign where it jabs Samsung's "lack of significant upgrades" on the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</li><li>The Chinese OEM pokes fun at four areas and offers help with its camera zooming and lack of boosted power with gift boxes.</li><li>Honor's "lighthearted" campaign is likely done to spur more competition between the two OEMs as it hopes folks with buy a Magic 7 Pro, instead.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor is running a new campaign as it seeks to push the envelope for how its recent flagship phone may "edge out" Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>According to Honor, the new campaign is designed to give Samsung "a little help" with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> to bring it up to par. The Chinese OEM states this "humorous" campaign, called "Happy 25th Sam," offers a few gift boxes that its competition might need to keep up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>. Honor jabs Samsung, stating it needs help in the power department; so, it's first gift is a power bank.</p><p>The press release highlights the Magic 7 Pro's 100W wired SuperCharge and 80W wireless charging capabilities for its 5,850mAh silicon-carbon battery (in China).</p><p>Another gift box is packed with a camera, equipped with a lens of a substantial focal length. Honor pokes fun at Samsung's recent Galaxy S25 Ultra zooming capabilities with this lens, comparing it to the Magic 7 Pro with AI Super Zoom. This feature is said to keep a high image quality over longer distance shots (over 30x). Moreover, the OEM highlights the phone's "industry-first" on-device portrait large model. This AI-backed model, dubbed AI Enhanced Portrait and Harcourt Portrait, is designed to deliver "striking details."</p><p>The post adds that users can leverage the phone's HD Super Burst and AI Motion Sensing for quicker capture.</p><p>Lastly, Honor says (lightheartedly) Samsung's methods of letting its users access apps on the Galaxy S25 Ultra aren't good enough either. It draws attention to the "Magic Portal" on the Magic 7 Pro, which lets users access "over 150+ third-party apps with a simple circle gesture."</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Honor says its jabs at Samsung are meant to be "playful" as it voices the "lack of significant upgrades" in the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The company adds that it believes that its recent flagship can "stand strong" against Samsung, furthering its interest in spurring more competition in the industry.</p><p>The Honor Magic 7 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-announced-europe">recently debuted in Europe</a>, a few days before the Galaxy Unpacked event, sporting the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. Of course, with many key upgrades over the Magic 6 Pro — and with Samsung's launch looming — Honor's device was looked at as potentially competing with the other. However, it's not like the Galaxy S25 Ultra hasn't advanced, especially when you consider its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">true AI companion</a>" hopes.</p><p>Samsung made the AI on its recent Ultra a little more personal, incorporating "enhanced recognition" via Circle to Search, massive Gemini updates, and the Now Bar/Now Brief on its lock and home screens. More importantly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">an extreme gauntlet</a> shows that Samsung has improved the battery/charging aspects of the S25 Ultra.</p><p>Though the phone sports a 5,000mAh battery with 45W charging like the S24 Ultra, the newer model went from 0% to 70% charge in 30 minutes. Additionally, the device could fully charge in just under an hour — much quicker than the S24 Ultra which went over the 60-minute mark.</p>

Meanwhile, U.S.-based PS5 owners should get ready for that jealous FOMO feeling because these kinds of limited-edition launches never seem to make it outside of Asia.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/2833736934/Pbe3CEWfm">Weibo</a> post (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/playstation-branded-fitness-tracker-3520210/">Android Authority</a>) explains that one lucky user who shares the post will be sent the box. However, it's fair to assume that Sony will also sell this limited-edition fitness tracker more widely to other Chinese fans.</p><p>We don't know how else the Sony-themed Xiaomi Smart Band 9 Pro differs from the normal version, aside from the cool watch strap; maybe it comes with unique software that pairs with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ps5-review">PS5</a> or Sony-themed watch faces.</p><p>Some Xiaomi bands get global releases and you can technically buy the Smart Band 9 Pro in the U.S. But I wouldn't hold my breath if I'm a PlayStation fan outside of China. Not just because this is a niche giveaway, but because it's an annoyingly common trend for Special Edition phones, watches, and other nerd-branded accessories to never make it to the United States, even when they should.</p>

<p>Android phones have a surprising number of limited editions. OnePlus, in particular, has targeted major nerd fandoms with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5t-star-wars-review" target="_blank">Star Wars-themed OnePlus 5T</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-6-avengers-edition" target="_blank">Avengers-themed OnePlus 6</a>, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-nord-2-pac-man-edition" target="_blank">old-school Pac-Man fans with the Nord 2</a>.</p><p>The trend has died out somewhat in recent years. Samsung, for example, sold a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-note-10-star-wars-edition-unboxing">Galaxy Note 10 Plus Star Wars Edition</a> and a Galaxy S20 Plus BTS Edition, but nerds have been hung dry for recent generations like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>. Still, Chinese brands like TECNO and POCO announced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-spark-30-bumblebee-edition-hands-on">Bumblebee Edition</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-is-the-poco-x7-pro-iron-man-edition">Iron Man Edition</a> of their new phones in January 2025, so the practice is alive and well.</p><p>Why do these phones rarely make it stateside? In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/forget-fe-phones-id-rather-have-more-special-edition-phones">2022 rant on limited-edition phones</a>, I explained how the few brands that can break into the Apple and Samsung-dominated U.S. tech market can't afford the licensing fees here. For whatever reason, selling an Iron Man phone in China is affordable, while it's all but impossible in the U.S.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, we'd see more tech — or at least official accessories — that let your geek flag fly, whether as a gamer, comic book nerd, sci-fi fanatic, or anything else. Your typical smartwatch is much too compact to show a unique design, but an exclusive <em>strap</em> and <em>watch faces</em> — like Sony's PlayStation-themed band for Xiaomi — would easily work.</p><p>If Sony can partner with Xiaomi to make a PlayStation-themed watch band, why not Apple or Samsung? Both brands sell dozens of watch straps in different colors, but we never see anything official with that kind of brand synergy. And that same logic could apply to all manner of other major brands, with fanbases that would snap up limited-edition tech in a second.</p><p>At least you can usually find a phone case with your favorite character on it. But that never seems to apply to watch bands, and I wish that along with all the bands focused on style, athletics, or comfort, we had more bands focused on <em>fun</em>!</p><p>I don't want something too kitschy or garish, but I can imagine other nerdy logos in place of those PlayStation buttons, like the Rebel Alliance crest or Starfleet badge, that could look neat attached to your smartwatch. And if you ever needed to look more serious for an event, you could always swap out your band for a more fashionable and subtle one.</p><p>The bigger priority right now is making sure that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/does-your-fluoroelastomer-smartwatch-band-have-dangerous-compounds">your watch band isn't toxic</a>, obviously. But hey, giving us nerds more fun watch band options is a great incentive to make us throw out our old bands and try something new!</p>

<ul><li>Google’s Pixel 4a battery update is a disaster, causing crazy battery drain for many users.</li><li>The update also wiped older firmware, leaving no way to roll back to the previous version.</li><li>Google has acknowledged the mess and offered compensation: a free battery replacement, $50 cash, or $100 credit toward a new Pixel.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/older-pixel-4a-to-get-an-all-new-battery-performance-update">rolled out a battery update for the Pixel 4a</a>, and it’s been a bit of a disaster. A bunch of users are reporting crazy battery drain since installing it. To add insult to injury, Google wiped the older firmware as part of the update process, so there’s no official way to go back to the previous version. If you’re dealing with this mess, you’re pretty much stuck at the moment.</p><p>After discontinuing the Pixel 4a last year, Google had left the device without any software updates. But out of nowhere, about two weeks ago, the company released a surprise update meant to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tips-pixel-smartphone-battery-health">improve battery performance</a>. Part of the Pixel 4a Battery Performance Program, it was supposed to help some units last longer on a charge. Instead, it ended up making battery problems worse for a ton of users.</p><p>In other words, the update was a total flop—lots of Pixel 4a owners are now stuck with awful battery life. And if you were thinking about rolling back to an older version to fix things, Google just shut that door by pulling the download links for previous firmware.</p><p>Someone on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1iajsu3/google_removed_pixel_4a_firmware_images_from/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> noticed that the only Android image you can get for the Pixel 4a is the new update that Google forced everyone to install in order to tackle unidentified battery issues (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/26/old-pixel-4a-updates/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The update might keep the Pixel 4a running, but it's essentially rendered it useless for many users.</p><p>One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4a/comments/1i6u7h8/comment/m8fbhnf/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> reported their 4a draining from full to 2% in just five hours, despite minimal screen usage (under 20 minutes).</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4a-firmware-removed-3520326/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> points out that Google rarely removes older firmware, implying a serious underlying issue with the Pixel 4a update.</p><p>Google is owning up to the battery disaster caused by the recent Pixel 4a update and is trying to make things right. The company is offering compensation to anyone impacted. To check if you’re eligible, hop over to this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/workflow/15642495" target="_blank">support page</a>, type in your phone’s IMEI number, and follow the steps. You’ll get to pick between a free battery replacement, $50 cash, or a $100 credit toward a new Pixel.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted the arrival of a new "Verified" badge on the Play Store, beginning with "trusted" VPNs.</li><li>This new badge will be placed on apps that have gone "above and beyond" with protecting its users' data and security.</li><li>VPNs must undergo a strict process, one that includes time for an independent review, as well, to determine its safety and data handling.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is highlighting a new update for the Play Store that aims to give users insight into how "protected" their data is before downloading an app.</p><p>As detailed today (Jan 28) in a blog post, Google states the Play Store will soon display a new "Verified" badge on apps that have gone "above and beyond" in user data protection. Google states this verification will appear via a VPN badge provided to apps that have completed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appdefensealliance.dev/masa/masa-al2">MASA</a> (Mobile Application Security Assessment) validation — an independent app review process.</p><p>Furthermore, these VPNs have also followed Google's set safety and security guidelines.</p><p>There's more that apps need to do before they are granted a Verified badge and seen as "doing the most" to protect a user's data. The post says apps must have an "Organization" account type, meet the Play Store's target API level, and submit a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469?sjid=11285933864377771824-NA">Data Safety section declaration</a>."</p><p>This final portion is important as Google states should be joined by two opt-in choices: an independent security review and "encryption in transit."</p>

<p>As previously stated, this Verified badge is rolling out for VPNs that are "trusted" for protecting your data. The post adds that VPNs (virtual private networks) like NordVPN, hide.me, and Aloha are among the first to have gone through the necessary hoops to demonstrate a higher level of security/safety.</p><p>NordVPN states, "We’re excited that the new ‘Verified’ badge will help users easily identify VPNs that meet high standards for security and privacy. In a market where trust is key, this badge not only provides reassurance to customers but also highlights the integrity of developers committed to delivering secure and reliable products."</p><p>Per the company, this consumer-facing badge will be displayed when viewing a VPN app's full details page, above the install button. Additionally, scrolling down to the "Data Safety" contents will show another badge, explaining that a specific app has been independently reviewed for security and safety measures.</p><p>The company has been pushing for more commitment toward user data safety and security <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tightens-rules-android-app-developers">ever since it tightened its ruleset</a>. Google started clamping down on low-quality apps in the Play Store with its late 2023 rollout of revamped Android Developer criteria. The new rules required developers to have tested their app with at least 20 users for two weeks <em>before </em>publishing it on the store.</p><p>The Play Store has also shifted gears and started focusing more on user-created reviews to see how an app is performing — and if it's meeting standards.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Data Protection Day is today, Jan. 28, 2025, and it's a world event intended to help people remember to follow the best practices for data privacy and security. It's only a coincidence that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deepseek-ai-is-crushing-the-competition-and-triggering-an-ai-stock-bloodbath">DeepSeek</a>, a new and free AI chatbot with an extremely questionably privacy policy, vaulted to the top charts of the App Store and Google Play Store shortly before Data Protection Day began.</p><p>Chances are, you've heard the name DeepSeek over the last day or two. Within the tech industry and stock market, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deepseek-already-had-a-usd1-trillion-impact-and-its-just-getting-started">the attention around DeepSeek AI </a>has been more about the open-source nature of its models and the cost required to train them rather than their effectiveness compared to chatbots like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-scheduled-tasks-beta-rollout">ChatGPT</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. "Despite its strong performance, it also maintains economical training costs," DeepSeek claims in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1#S6" target="_blank">white paper</a>.</p><p>The short recap is that DeepSeek's latest open-source AI model, DeepSeek V3, quickly became lauded by researchers and benchmarks. It performs comparably to the top OpenAI models publicly available, despite the fact that DeepSeek V3 is free for users to access and is supposedly cheap to train.</p><p>"Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepSeek-V3 has emerged as the strongest open-source model currently available, and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet," wrote DeepSeek researchers in the conclusion of the white paper. The company's internal findings have since been supported by independent tests, hence why the DeepSeek AI app has blown up globally.</p><p>So, why are users mass downloading DeepSeek, and why should that give you pause on Data Protection Day?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mGEJq6HVFqMjDjiyAJc294" name="DeepSeek" alt="DeepSeek AI Assistant with R1 reasoning model running on Nubia Z70 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mGEJq6HVFqMjDjiyAJc294.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For starters, it's worth noting that much of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-can-save-tiktok-from-united-states-ban">fear in the U.S. about Chinese-based apps and services</a> is relatively unfounded. As an example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">TikTok stores all U.S. user data</a> in a secure Oracle cloud environment — it's not stored in China, and it's not even stored in TikTok's international servers in Virginia or Singapore.</p><p>It's the opposite with DeepSeek. To its credit, the company is being transparent about its data storage practices and privacy policy. It's all outlined on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chat.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%20Privacy%20Policy.html" target="_blank">DeepSeek website</a>, but it's not something you should be eager to agree to.</p><p>"The personal information we collect from you may be stored on a server located outside of the country where you live," the company explains. "We store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China."</p><p>This is problematic due to China's Cybersecurity Law and National Intelligence Law, which require companies in China to share data with the government when requested. Being that DeepSeek AI is based in China and all user data is stored there, it is completely possible that the company could share your information with the Chinese government and other companies.</p><p>In fact, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-ai-china-privacy-data/" target="_blank">Wired</a> report found that DeepSeek AI already appears to send data to Baidu, a Chinese technology giant specializing in search, and Volces, a Chinese infrastructure company.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qp68TBCXdkbxwUXJZKvSET" name="Deekseek-AI" alt="DeekSeek AI welcome page on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qp68TBCXdkbxwUXJZKvSET.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6016" height="3384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, DeepSeek's ties to China are not the reason you shouldn't use the app. It's a factor, sure, but the privacy concerns are much simpler than that. You shouldn't be willing to give up the data DeepSeek admits it collects <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/data-breaches-how-protect-yourself">to any private corporation or government</a>, whether it be in the U.S., China, or any other region.</p><p>Simply put, DeepSeek collects <em>a lot</em> of data. It might know your birthday, email address, or phone number, depending on how you sign up. If you use an Apple or Google account, it collects some information from those accounts, like access tokens.</p><p>More worryingly, the company receives data that has nothing to do with DeepSeek AI. Using the information you gave DeepSeek, it tries to match its profile about you to your actions elsewhere. The official DeepSeek <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chat.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%20Privacy%20Policy.html" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> outlines everything:<br><br>"Advertisers, measurement, and other partners share information with us about you and the actions you have taken outside of the Service, such as your activities on other websites and apps or in stores, including the products or services you purchased, online or in person. These partners also share information with us, such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help match you and your actions outside of the Service."</p><p>If that wasn't enough to spook you, DeepSeek also collects your keystroke patterns or rhythms, as well as your IP address. In other words, the company registers what you're typing, even if it's in another app or if you never enter your DeepSeek prompt.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ceAoG3XT8se7J2XpBifvz3" name="DeepSeek" alt="In-hand view of DeepSeek AI Assistant running on Nubia Z70 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ceAoG3XT8se7J2XpBifvz3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To be fair, consumers don't have a ton of leverage when it comes to using products and services in the U.S. That's why many of us simply accept the terms and conditions and move on. However, on Data Protection Day, DeepSeek gives us a great example of why we shouldn't do that. You're surrendering a lot more data than you probably thought you would by downloading a top-charting AI chatbot from the App Store or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a>.</p><p>More importantly, apply scrutiny of companies' privacy policies and data collection practices to more than just DeepSeek. No matter what U.S. politicians would lead you to believe, there's plenty more to worry about than just Chinese companies. Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Apple, and many more tech companies are all collecting varying levels of data from you, and it's worth thinking about what you're willing to share to access the latest AI models.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-122">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 Pro’s camera bar is reportedly peeling off, raising concerns about a possible design flaw.</li><li>Cases suggest the problem may let dust and water in, hinting at a structural weakness.</li><li>Initially quick to replace affected devices, Google’s support has since been criticized for dismissing complaints after the 90-day period.</li></ul>

<p>Google’s camera bar, first seen on the Pixel 6 series, was meant to be a standout feature. But with the Pixel 9 Pro, it seems Google might’ve missed the mark—users are reporting that the camera bar is peeling off the back of the phone.</p><p>Back in October, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1g65ybp/9_pro_camera_bar_popped_off/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> with a wonky camera bar caught everyone’s attention. The owner said the bar was coming loose from the phone’s body, which was pretty weird since they claimed it had been in a case the whole time and never took a tumble or got damaged.</p><p>This whole thing kind of screams “design flaw” or maybe a factory oopsie. Either way, it’s a reminder that even the fanciest devices can have some serious growing pains.</p><p>Now, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-9-pro-camera-bar-breaking-again/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> first reported, Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1ia6b3q/pixel_9_pro_camera_bar_is_separating_from_phone/" target="_blank">MohiFlaz</a> shared their frustrating experience with the Pixel 9 Pro. They went into full protective mode right away after buying the phone three months ago. They’ve been super careful with it too, with no drops or rough treatment. But despite all that TLC, the camera bar is still coming loose.</p><p>When the first incident popped up, Google was quick to send a replacement. But now, MohiFlaz is calling out Google for their less-than-stellar response this time around.</p><p>In the comments, the user didn’t hold back and vented about their experience with Google Support. As per the comment, Google Support basically shrugged them off because the phone is over 90 days old. So now they’re stuck between a rock and a hard place, probably looking at forking over some cash to get it fixed elsewhere.</p><p>In both cases, the camera bar started peeling from the top edge, opening up gaps that could let water and dust sneak in. Given how similar these cases are, it’s pretty likely Google knows about the 9 Pro’s structural issues. But despite that, the phone’s still sitting on store shelves, which makes you wonder if they’re just hoping no one notices.</p>

<p>We have reached out to Google for a statement and will update this post when we hear back.</p><p>Since Google hasn’t said much about why the camera bar is peeling off or how to stop it, it’s probably smart to play it safe. Slapping on one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">best Pixel 9 Pro cases</a> might be your best move.</p><p>The Pixel 9 series didn’t take down the big players, but it did set new sales records for Google. However, the last thing Google needs now is bad press, so handling unhappy customers with care will be key.</p>

The Chinese startup burst into the limelight back in December after debuting the R1, a model that uses self-checking mechanisms to reason and deliver accurate answers to complex questions.</p>

<p>Most chatbots today — like ChatGPT and Gemini — use inference models to come up with an answer, and they're trained on billions of inputs. While they excel at generalized queries, they struggle with solving complex coding and math problems, but this is slowly changing. OpenAI rolled out its o1 reasoning model at the end of last year, and it uses chain-of-thought — where it runs through multiple steps — to come up with an answer. <br><br>DeepSeek is challenging the status quo with its own solution. The DeepSeek R1 is a reasoning model that's built on the V3 large language model, and what's noteworthy about it is that it is claimed to be developed at a fraction of the cost of what U.S. entities are doing. Essentially, DeepSeek says it spent under $6 million to train its model, which is ridiculous — U.S. brands invested hundreds of millions of dollars in training each model, and billions in infrastructure. <br><br>Oh, and you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.deepseek.com/">don't need to pay anything to use it</a>. It's the latter point that's causing so much consternation; to give you some context, OpenAI charges $200 a month for ChatGPT Pro, which is built on the o1 model. With DeepSeek R1, you get something that's just as good — for absolutely free. This runs counter to the fundamental ideal of Silicon Valley, where the tenet is that if there's a halfway- decent product, the main goal is to monetize it. <br></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NPbycu6Qsu2DJFVLqAEmC4" name="DeepSeek" alt="DeepSeek AI Assistant with R1 reasoning model running on Nubia Z70 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPbycu6Qsu2DJFVLqAEmC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>DeepSeek is doing things a bit differently; it open-sourced the r1, so anyone can take a look under the hood to see how it runs, or modify it as they see fit. It's no wonder, then, that DeepSeek climbed to the top of the App Store charts after just a week of availability. Its introduction had a seismic effect on the sector as a whole; the U.S. stock market lost a cumulative $1 trillion in value, with NVIDIA alone losing $589 billion in market value — the most by any organization on a single day.</p><p>Obviously, the market will correct itself, and the panic will ease as U.S. companies seek out ways to catch up — OpenAI is already touting that it will roll out "better models." But what DeepSeek exceled at doing is democratizing cutting-edge AI and making it accessible to everyone, and that alone is the biggest signal that the next big breakthrough in this category may not come from Silicon Valley after all. <br><br>While I'm not keen on generative AI, I dabble with ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude occasionally, and they clearly have their use cases. Reasoning models, however, are actually interesting; they have the ability to use logical reasoning and understand context, so if you ask a follow-up question, you get relevant answers. The best part is that all of this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deepseek.chat">runs on your phone</a> — I had no issues using the AI assistant on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> and Nubia Z70 Ultra among others. <br><br>They're particularly great at solving math problems and creative thinking, and more than anything else, this is where DeepSeek's R1 fulfils its potential. And best of all, it doesn't cost you anything to use it. The breakneck pace of this industry and the staggering amounts of money being thrown at anyone building AI tech means we don't have to wait too long to witness the next big milestone.</p>

<hr>
<p>A Chinese AI startup called DeepSeek seems to be outperforming Big Tech’s models with way less money and resources, and it’s totally rattling the U.S. tech sector.</p><p>DeepSeek has sent shockwaves through global markets with its latest AI launch. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/tech-stocks-react-chinas-deepseek-sparks-us-worries-ai-race-rcna189394" target="_blank">NBC News</a>, the Nasdaq Composite dropped over 3%. The Dow managed to recover, closing up nearly 300 points after a rough start, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%.</p><p>Nvidia, a major player in AI, took a massive hit Monday, losing a staggering $593 billion in market value as tech stocks tanked, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-deepseek-sets-off-ai-market-rout-2025-01-27/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports. This was due to fears that DeepSeek has jumped ahead of the U.S. in the AI race. This marks the biggest one-day loss any company has ever seen on Wall Street.</p><p>DeepSeek isn’t holding back—the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1hqjimz/deepseek_claims_they_beat_openais_01_model_on/" target="_blank">saying</a> its AI is just as good, if not better, than the top U.S. models, all while costing way less. That bold claim has sent Nvidia and other AI chipmakers into a tailspin, with their stocks taking a serious hit.</p><p>Launched in 2023, this Hangzhou-based startup rolled out its first large language model before that year was even over.</p><p>DeepSeek started turning heads in the AI world last month after dropping a new model that it claims rivals top U.S. players like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-code-suggests-default-assistant-android">OpenAI’s ChatGPT</a>, while being way more efficient with pricey Nvidia chips for training on massive datasets.</p><p>The startup’s open AI model, DeepSeek V3, is crushing it on popular benchmarks. Despite its size, it’s super efficient, breezing through tasks like coding and essay writing.</p><p>Obviously, what’s got some U.S. tech watchers nervous is how this Chinese startup has managed to keep pace with top American generative AI players while spending way less cash.</p><p>If that’s true, it makes you wonder if U.S. tech companies are blowing through cash for data centers and chips when there might be a cheaper, smarter way to keep AI moving forward.</p>

<ul><li>A widespread issue impacted most Garmin watch users on January 28 and 29, causing devices to be bricked.</li><li>The cause appears to be related to the daily satellite data packet that is pushed out to all Garmin watches that use GPS tracking.</li><li>Garmin put a red banner on their website on Tuesday officially acknowledging the issue, with a temporary fix.</li><li>On Wednesday, Garmin promised that it had resolved the issue in the backend.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Update 3 (4p PT day 2): </strong>Garmin says that "We have resolved the underlying issue causing some devices to be stuck on the startup screen or a blue triangle" on a banner located on its Garmin Support page. This is a relief to all Garmin users, but may not be much solace to those who already had to struggle through watch crashes and difficult reboot procedures over the last couple of days.</p><p>Garmin says that if you "Press and hold the power/light button on the device until the watch shuts off," turn it back on, then sync it with your Connect app or plug it into your computer's Garmin Express app, it should solve your watch's issue and replace the malicious file that caused this issue.</p><p>If this still doesn't work, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=IWfNuaG0jn6d6oQ4HCVz29">this Support page</a> has step-by-step instructions for each type of Garmin watch, while acknowledging that you'll lose the data that wasn't already synced to your device due to the forced reset.</p><p>Even if your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> hasn't crashed yet, I urge you to sync your Garmin watch in the Connect app by tapping the blue circular-arrow icon next to the watch icon in the top-right corner. This will ensure your watch doesn't retain the old file. Either that or you can go into your watch settings and disable GPS for a workout profile. But ideally, this Garmin backend fix has ensured that this is no longer necessary!</p><p>I myself am thinking about unboxing and setting up my new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-garmin-instinct-3-went-amoled-sort-of-heres-every-new-trick-and-tool">Garmin Instinct 3</a>, now that the crisis is finally winding down.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2 (10a PT day 2): </strong>Now the<strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://connect.garmin.com/status/">Garmin Connect System Status</a> shows a "Limited" status next to Activity Uploads, as it appears that Garmin watch owners are still bricking their devices whenever they attempt to start an activity.</p><p>It's been over a day since the problems began, and both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/">Garmin subreddit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/">Garmin forums</a> are chock-full of complaints about the fiasco and Garmin Support's slow response.</p><p>Many users are now able to perform activities, but tread cautiously, as it's sometimes unclear whether or not your watch has replaced the satellite file responsible for this fiasco or not; definitely make sure to sync your watch with Garmin Connect manually, which should hopefully refresh the file with the latest version.</p><p>We've also found that users who manage to escape the blue-triangle bootloop, whether by hard-resetting it with the steps below or connecting it to Garmin Express on their computer, will still find persistent issues like missing workouts, gaps in their training plans, lost Body Battery or Daily Readiness data, and so on.</p><p>It might be best to avoid workouts entirely, or pull one of your old Garmin watches out of your closet and use that until everything has resolved itself.</p><p><strong>Update 1 (6:00p PT day 1): </strong>The<strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://connect.garmin.com/status/">Garmin Connect System Status</a> now shows "Online" status across the board; it previously said that Activity Uploads were down. However, some users are still reporting serious issues if they attempt to start an activity.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/garmin-watches-are-crashing-when-trying-to-start-gps.html">DC Rainmaker</a> has reported that the issue stems from a bad "satellite pre-cache file" wreaking havoc on watches. If your watch is synced with Garmin Connect, it should now have access to the proper file, in theory, preventing any further issues. But this won't help if your watch is already stuck in the bootloop.</p><p>The recommendation is still to hold down your watch's Light or Power button for up to 30 seconds to turn it off, then turn it back on and see if the problem is resolved. If this doesn't work, reset it again, then hold down both the START/STOP and BACK buttons while it's off; then press the Light button briefly to turn it on while still holding down the other two buttons. You'll hear two beeps; release the Start button after the first beep, then the back button after the second beep. This should theoretically free your Garmin watch from its endless loop (<em>source: </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=FMYxESEmhz9PKH0L1nMI97">Garmin Support</a>).</p><p>If your problem persists, you should get in contact with Garmin Support or use the Garmin Forums for more step-by-step guidance. And if you haven't experienced the blue triangle yourself, our recommendation is to wait to do any activities on your Garmin watch until you're sure the problem is resolved.</p><p><em>The original article is below:</em></p><p>Garmin watch users had a rough Tuesday morning dealing with their wearables, as most of them were in a frozen state.</p><p>Several users took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1ibz59m/have_a_useless_watch_now/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=whitespace&embed_host_url=https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/live/garmin-down-reports-surface-of-many-garmin-watches-crashing-are-you-affected">Reddit</a> to report that their Garmin watches have become practically useless and stuck on the boot screen. Some of these wearables have been displaying a blue triangle as well (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/live/garmin-down-reports-surface-of-many-garmin-watches-crashing-are-you-affected">TechRadar</a>).</p><p>According to the publication, this issue is affecting users in the UK, US, India, and France. Some devices that have been reported so far include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-garmin-forerunner-model-right-me">Forerunner models </a>(265, 965, 255, and 955), the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-venu-2-review"> Garmin Venu 2 </a>and 3, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmins-fenix-7-smartwatches-announced">Garmin Fenix 7</a>, and the Epix Pro Gen 2, but there could be more devices facing this issue.</p><p>There is not much information as to what caused this widespread issue; however, some users have been speculating that it could be a network-related error or that the company's systems are down. However, Connect Garmin's Status <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://connect.garmin.com/status/">website</a> indicated that Activity Uploads are down, with the warning "We are aware of an issue causing some devices to be stuck on the start up screen or a blue triangle."</p>

<p>"Just sharing - my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/garmin-forerunner-255s-music">Garmin Forerunner 255 Music</a> was faced with the infinity loop issue currently ongoing. No particular trigger, the one moment I received a Teams message, the other it was black-screen and rebooting. Happened at precisely 12 (midday)," a user told TechRadar in an email.</p><p>Reddit users have come up with their workaround of a hard reset even before the company addressed the issue. This even caused some users to lose their data on the device. Other users who contacted support say that they heard an automated message saying they are aware of reports of the blue triangle and they're working on a fix.</p><p>On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=IWfNuaG0jn6d6oQ4HCVz29">Garmin Support website</a>, you'll find a banner with the following guidance: "We are aware of an issue causing some devices to be stuck on the start up screen or a blue triangle. To resolve this, press and hold the power button until the device turns off, then power it back on, and sync with the Garmin Connect app or Garmin Express."</p><p>Garmin links users to this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=IWfNuaG0jn6d6oQ4HCVz29">"My Garmin Device Will Not Boot" page</a> if the steps above don't work. There, it reiterates that you should try holding down the power button for 15 seconds, but that if it doesn't solve the problem, "you will need to complete a factory reset," which will remove certain features like Garmin Wallet and your settings temporarily. All of your health and fitness data (prior to the crash) should be preserved, as long as you synced your watch to the Connect app recently.</p><p>However, we'd recommend you hold off on a factory reset until it's a last resort. It's possible that this issue will persist until Garmin resolves the problem on <em>its</em> side, which would mean a factory reset won't solve your problem.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-137">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Nothing has a new event geared up for March 4 — right around MWC.</li><li>The launch teaser hints at a new hardware launch that will include glyph interfaces.</li><li>It is still unclear what to expect from the launch event, but it is expected to be either Phone 3 or Phone 3a, and also a bunch of audio products.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The anticipation around Phone 3 keeps building up, and Nothing is now having a hardware launch slated this March as the company just teased. However, it is still unclear what the product is, but it surely looks like a phone launch.</p><p>According to the latest teaser, a new phone launch is likely scheduled for March 4 at 10 a.m. GMT. Like the signature Nothing products, the upcoming device will also have a glyph interface, likely right around the camera visor.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/9MmuzleJai<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884210887025959065">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While the Phone 3 from Nothing is long overdue, as its predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> came back in 2023, it still needs to be determined what we will see at the March event. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/27/nothing-phone-3-march-launch-date-teaser/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, however, it could be Phone 3a rather than the flagship Phone 3, per a recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/12ushabh/status/1883904862020338059">spotted e-commerce listing</a>.</p><p>A Flipkart e-commerce listing (now removed) teaser of the upcoming event has indicated that it is indeed a Phone 3a launch and not the Phone 3 itself. The launch time also hints at the same, as it just falls around the Mobile World Congress event happening from March 3-6 in Barcelona. For the uninitiated, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> was released during the same event last year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WIP 📱 pic.twitter.com/L3c5K356W0<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1882369936183665088">January 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Nothing has also shared some sketches of the upcoming product that the company is currently working on. There are a bunch of sketches, which don’t precisely reveal the product and it’s also a wild guess whether it is Phone 3 or the Phone 3a or whether it is a phone after all.</p><p>At a glance though, they appear to be sketches of a phone internal or probably some of the glyph interface we might probably get to see after the product launch.</p><p>Lastly, alongside the Phone 2a launch last year, the company’s sub-brand had also released CMF Buds and Neckband. The teaser could also mean that we might also see their successors with the hint of glyph interface integration for the first time on the company’s affordable range, which is a wild guess and to be taken into consideration with a grain of salt.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Xiaomi clearly knows how to make great-sounding audio products on a budget, and the Sound Outdoor is no different. The Bluetooth speaker is available in vibrant colors, and a big part of its allure is the 30W sound it is able to produce. Combine that with IP67 ingress protection, and you get a speaker that nails the basics. <br><br>As is often the case with Xiaomi's audio products, affordability is a key selling point of the Sound Outdoor. The speaker was introduced in China back in May 2024, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/mi-sound-outdoor-30w-ip67-upto-12-hours-playback-30-w-bluetooth-speaker/p/itm17099bbcfdd72">costs ₹3,999 ($46) in India</a>; a great value when you consider the feature-set. You can also pick it up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Portable-Bluetooth-Wireless-Waterproof/dp/B0D9ZXFX9C">on Amazon in the U.S. for $65</a>, and if you want to go the reseller route, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/i/1005006902377465.html">listed at AliExpress for $49</a>. If you want to buy it in the U.K., you'll need to shell out £35 ($44).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DsEi82iWP4FWY4fEa2dUj8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsEi82iWP4FWY4fEa2dUj8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like Tribit's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tribit-stormbox-2-review">StormBox 2</a> and most new products in this segment, the Sound Outdoor has a cylindrical design that makes it easy to take anywhere. There's a carrying hook at the top that allows you to dangle it from a bag, and the bright orange hue does a great job accentuating the otherwise-muted black color scheme. If you need a bit of vibrancy, the speaker is available in blue and red color variants as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9qhXjFx562ZRmFLD9zDTr8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qhXjFx562ZRmFLD9zDTr8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The outer surface of the Sound Outdoor is coated in fabric with a mesh covering, and it feels great to hold. You get rubber feet on one side, and Xiaomi's logo is emblazoned at the front, but as it's in the same color as the fabric, it isn't as visible. The playback controls are mounted at the top of the Sound Outdoor, and you get volume up/down along with a multifunction button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ARfR9234WnRda6RNTb3Kd8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ARfR9234WnRda6RNTb3Kd8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The back of the unit houses the power button, Bluetooth pairing mode, USB-C port (hidden behind a gasket), and a stereo pairing button. Interestingly, Xiaomi says you can connect the Sound Outdoor with 99 other speakers, creating an array totaling 100 units. But as the manufacturer sent over just the one unit for testing, I wasn't able to see if this feature is any good. Regardless, it should be good enough in stereo mode as well, so if you want a wider soundstage, picking up two of these is a good option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c5wKmMD6WFxabL5YJXqoZ8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5wKmMD6WFxabL5YJXqoZ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Either end of the Sound Outdoor has a passive radiator that does a good job creating a vibrant sound, and the speaker itself contains two driver units — a 20W woofer and a 10W tweeter. The combined 30W sound is among the best in this category, and it does a decent enough job in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kt6hnsjq4Ntqg7HVzNDth8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kt6hnsjq4Ntqg7HVzNDth8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi's audio gear has a characteristic sound with a bass-heavy sound signature, and that's the case with the Sound Outdoor as well. You get a good energy in the low-end along with clear mids and recessed highs, and the overall tonality lends itself well to casual listening. As the name suggests, this speaker's main attraction is that it can be used outdoors, and in that context, I have no issues with the sound.</p>

<p>To that effect, you get IP67 dust and water resistance, making the Sound Outdoor immune to any inclement weather conditions. I used it in the shower, and the carrying hook means you can easily dangle it on a shower caddy. Coming in at 597g, it isn't too heavy either, and the easy portability combined with the powerful sound makes it a great choice for use in the home or outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="H8KWAjywaQx4oMJebRehZ8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H8KWAjywaQx4oMJebRehZ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn't see any issues with Bluetooth connectivity either; the speaker has Bluetooth 5.4, and I paired it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>. You don't get any Bluetooth codecs outside of the standard SBC and AAC, but again, that's good enough in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="E4pLmoxjU5Eaqqf9Yhfbk8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E4pLmoxjU5Eaqqf9Yhfbk8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no problems with battery life either. The Sound Outdoor has a 2600mAh battery, and it lasted just over eight and a half hours in my testing, with the volume turned up (obviously). It charges via 15W USB PD (5W/3A), so you can use just about any charger with the speaker. However, as there's no fast charging, it takes over two and a half hours to charge the Sound Outdoor, so I'd suggest plugging it in at night.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vJEoFLg9XiVxdaJ5JPtTf8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJEoFLg9XiVxdaJ5JPtTf8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you need better sound, I highly recommend the StormBox 2 — it is my go-to portable speaker these days. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Bluetooth-Surround-Waterproof/dp/B0CW933QSJ">costlier at $69</a>, but you get a richer sound, better battery, and I like the design a little better. The StormBox 2 can also be used in stereo mode, and you get extensive customizability when it comes to the sound.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you want something that isn't as big, Xiaomi's Sound Pocket has the same design in a smaller and lighter chassis. The speaker also gets IP67 ingress protection, and while the 5W driver doesn't get anywhere as loud or detailed, it is decent enough in its own right. It also uses a cavity to create a louder sound, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Portable-Wireless-Bluetooh-Resistance/dp/B0CZRLRGM5">costs $39 on Amazon</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3tw2r6jeyDupM2R3m6W7f8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tw2r6jeyDupM2R3m6W7f8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the Sound Outdoor is another win for Xiaomi. The speaker looks good, has a great sound, and doesn't cost as much as its rivals. In short, this is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">best budget Bluetooth speakers</a> you can get today.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While TerraMaster always had a good selection of budget-focused models, the brand undertook an ambitious overhaul last year in a bid to target the high-end segment. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">tested the all-flash F8 SSD Plus</a> when it debuted, and came away thinking the brand did a great job not just on the hardware side, but also the software. <br><br>With the F4-424 Max, TerraMaster is looking to continue that momentum. The 4-bay NAS has the best hardware package in its category, including two 10GbE ports, a 10-core Intel Core i5 1235U platform, 8GB of upgradeable RAM, and four traditional drive bays in addition to two M.2 slots. <br><br>Combine that with the changes to TOS 6 software, and the F4-424 Max has the potential to be one of the best 4-bay NAS models you can buy today, particularly if you're looking to build a high-end Plex server. I used the NAS for over two months, and here's why I think it is a better choice than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a>.</p>

<p>TerraMaster unveiled the F4-424 Max in Q4 2024, and the NAS is now available globally. It retails <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">for $899 on Amazon</a>, and if you don't need dual 10GbE connectivity, there's a standard F4-424 with dual 2.5GbE ports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0CPP5GDZ3">that costs $499</a>. This variant is powered by the Intel N95 and shares a similar design. There's also an F4-424 Pro that has a Core i3-N305 and 16GB of memory along with dual 2.5GbE connectivity, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DDXLCLV7">that model is $649</a>.</p>


<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-design"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HtFwVJbGEMqsYf876PwAZU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HtFwVJbGEMqsYf876PwAZU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TerraMaster's earlier offerings stood out because of their distinctive aluminum enclosures, and while the design was intriguing, they didn't have the best thermal efficiency. The brand is addressing that with the F4-424 Max by switching to a more modest aesthetic, with a black chassis that doesn't attract as much attention.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8Qvy84U34AveBCWfWFG2dU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Qvy84U34AveBCWfWFG2dU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's notable is that the sides are ventilated — similar to what you get with the DS923+ — allowing better airflow into the NAS. The server is smaller than other 4-bay NAS models I tested recently, and as is always the case with TerraMaster, you get a 120W external power brick.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YRg75AWb3AX5WcdLq7rUYU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRg75AWb3AX5WcdLq7rUYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also like that there's now a 120mm fan at the back, and it does a fantastic job ensuring the drives don't overheat. As an added bonus, it doesn't get loud either. TerraMaster has a new design for the drive bays as well, with a push-to-latch mechanism that's easy to use. The brand finally switched to a tool-free drive installation, and this makes slotting in 3.5-inch HDDs significantly easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VNHpoK3JjGJrpmu5nFt2gU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VNHpoK3JjGJrpmu5nFt2gU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, there isn't much else at the front. You get the usual status LEDs, and while most NAS models have a USB port that lets you plug in a drive, that isn't the case here — all the ports are located at the back. Interestingly, even the power button is at the back, with TerraMaster opting to go with a clean look up front that doesn't look too busy. <br><br>The changes to the design deliver meaningful benefits. The F4-424 Max has much better ventilation, and the chassis doesn't stand out quite as much, blending into the background.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-ports-and-connectivity"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: Ports and connectivity</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ndARLRPwWhuh8wRnwmKMWU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ndARLRPwWhuh8wRnwmKMWU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the fact that you're getting two 10 Gigabit ports at the back of the NAS is the biggest differentiator, and it gives it a distinct edge — particularly when you consider that the DS923+ has dual Ethernet connectivity. You don't get the ability to add an additional port, but that shouldn't be an issue to anyone considering this NAS; with a 20Gbps addressable bandwidth, you don't have to worry about the network connection being the bottleneck.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GLwNVDPiGpr6jZ62RBaAgU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GLwNVDPiGpr6jZ62RBaAgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are two USB-A ports alongside a USB-C port, and all three get 10Gbps bandwidth. I would have liked to see the USB-C connector at the front as that makes connecting external drives easier, but other than that, I don't have any problems with the port selection.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xperaV7uGCk8XJCbgbcPaU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xperaV7uGCk8XJCbgbcPaU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The NAS comes with 8GB of DDR5 non-ECC memory pre-installed, which takes up one of the two SO-DIMM slots available. You can switch out the memory modules and increase it to 64GB (32GB in each slot) should you wish to do so. There are two M.2 Gen 4 slots available as well, and they're easily accessible by sliding the left side panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zgKtXeXfLD9fnX3ZpXBbZU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zgKtXeXfLD9fnX3ZpXBbZU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each drive bay accommodates 22TB NAS HDDs, so the total addressable storage is 88TB without including the M.2 bays. If you are thinking of going this route, I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-Enterprise-Internal-ST22000NT001/dp/B0B94NBBJH">22TB IronWolf Pro drives</a>; I use these in my main NAS, and they're terrific.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-real-world-testing"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: Real-world testing</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KoaEGNupWGorxXfBfFMvXU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KoaEGNupWGorxXfBfFMvXU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Powered by Intel's 10-core Alder Lake Core i5 1235U with integrated Iris Xe, there isn't any shortage of power here. If anything, the NAS is among the best of any 4-bay server I tested, and there have been plenty of standout products over the last two years. <br><br>There are no issues in daily use, and whether it's running a VM or managing an extensive Plex library, the NAS easily breezes through demanding tasks. It has hardware transcoding and effortlessly manages to transcode 4K videos, and I didn't see any issues in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gk8QogvhZ8Lypwh65KSZaU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gk8QogvhZ8Lypwh65KSZaU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, I didn't notice any problems with file transfers, with the NAS able to saturate the bandwidth of the IronWolf drives with relative ease. You'll ideally need to use M.2 drives like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN850X-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B0B7CQ2CHH">WD SN850X</a> to take full advantage of the 10GbE connectivity. <br><br>The TOS 6 software is much better than previous iterations, and you get native clients for most utilities, including media streaming, backing up data, and virtual machines. You get Docker containerization as well, so you can easily install just about any service you need if it isn't available as standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WMnLg77Qpov7X38XuspMNU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WMnLg77Qpov7X38XuspMNU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only issue in this area is that the software tends to be buggy at times, and the mobile clients aren't anywhere as polished as other brands. While there is a Photos client, it doesn't have any of the advanced features you get with DiskStation models. <br><br>It's clear that TerraMaster still has some work to do with the software, but I will admit that TOS 6 is a step forward — it delivers a cleaner interface and has much better usability. There's also the fact that if you don't like the software, you can just install TrueNAS Scale on the NAS.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-the-alternatives"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: The alternatives</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8H4XG8zH74V5MubFfC3dx5" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-20.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8H4XG8zH74V5MubFfC3dx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two years after its release, the DiskStation DS923+ is still a great choice due to the software feature-set. It definitely lags behind in terms of the hardware — every other NAS I tested has better connectivity — but the rock-solid software utilities combined with the robust mobile clients make the DS923+ an enticing choice, and it does a great job as a Plex server.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-should-you-buy-it"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LcxA6b5i3NqbAHpscm7ygU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LcxA6b5i3NqbAHpscm7ygU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a powerful 4-bay server</li><li>You want 10GbE connectivity as standard</li><li>You need hardware that will last a decade</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best software in this category</li><li>You need a great value</li></ul>
<p>Outside of a few software drawbacks, there isn't much to fault with the F4-424 Max. The hardware is clearly the main selling point, and the inclusion of dual 10GbE ports along with the powerful Intel chipset and upgradeable memory makes it a fantastic choice if you want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">best Plex NAS</a>. <br><br>While the TOS 6 software is much better than previous iterations, it's still missing that final bit of polish, and if you don't like the pre-installed software, you can roll your own — and that's enticing in its own right. I'm going to install TrueNAS and write a feature talking about how it holds up against TOS 6, but the fact that you can do so is in itself a big deal. <br><br>The F4-424 Max doesn't quite have the same value-focused pricing as its predecessors, but the upgrades to the hardware and software extensibility make it a good overall choice nonetheless.</p>

<p><em><strong>A BUNCH of people have asked:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Does the Samsung Galaxy S25 support the WPC's Qi 2 specifications? Can I use MagSafe stuff with it? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Alternatively:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Why doesn't the Galaxy S25 support Qi 2 without buying a special case from Samsung?</strong></em></p>
<p>It seems like everyone wanted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> to support Qi 2 with MagSafe so they can stick their new phone to things and charge it or do whatever else someone can come up with using magnets. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">I've got good news, and I have bad news</a>.</p><p>First, I want to say that while Samsung makes some great products, the company can be terrible regarding messaging. My dad would say they could wreck a box of ball bearings.</p><p>That could be intentional, maybe to keep an air of mystery surrounding new products, or because we like to pretend leaked information will always be true.</p>
<p>In any case, the Galaxy S25 does support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/standards/qi-wireless-charging/" target="_blank">Qi 2.1.0</a> (they insist the zero be added and is important) specifications, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/23254">listed</a> by the Wireless Power Consortium, which includes:</p><p><strong>1. Fast charging: transmitters and receivers can handle up to 15 watts of power.</strong></p><p><strong>2. Qi transmitters can be operated using USB power.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Better foreign object detection.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Choice of a single coil, coil array, or moving coil transmitter.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Technical bits and pieces from previous versions.</strong></p><p>Notice what's missing from these specs? Anything having to do with magnets. That's because when the Qi2 standard was restructured for version 2.0, the Magnetic Power Profile (what you might think of as MagSafe) was separated and is now its own standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xbXvngxxSw7oAWHpToARUV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-back-navy-iceblue-mint-02" alt="All four colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbXvngxxSw7oAWHpToARUV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>You can use the S25 with any Qi 2.1.0 or older charger, and it will charge. It just won't stick to anything because it's not magnetic.</p><p>If you want support for the MPP you will have to buy a case that has the magnets in the right(ish) spot.</p><p>Yay, technology!</p>
<p>Why is it like this? Couldn't Samsung have just slapped the magnets inside the S25 and called it a day? This is just a scam to sell pricey Samsung cases, right?</p><p>Probably not. I'm sure Samsung is very happy to sell you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">phone accessories like cases</a>, but I think this time there is more to it all. This was the easy way to try and give everyone what they wanted without reinventing the "guts" of the current Galaxy S series.</p><p>Qi2 with the MPP is a mostly open standard (meaning any company can license it and use it to build stuff), but it is based on something Apple first started doing. It's great that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23538131/qi2-wireless-charging-apple-samsung">Apple gave something like this away,</a> and I'm not complaining, but it means the phone was designed first, and the magnetic latching system was built around it.</p><p>Engineers at Apple put magnets and a receiver coil inside the iPhone where they would fit in the correct configuration and not interfere with any other components. Everything works great because it was all designed to work together.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ciTqDSkHMn8NkXmfZSQ8ZZ" name="magsafe-iphone-14-pro-max-pixel-7-pro-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-together.jpg" alt="Pixel 7 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, and Galaxy Z Fold 4 together" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ciTqDSkHMn8NkXmfZSQ8ZZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Qi2 first came out, I predicted it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation">destined to fail</a> because the magnet arrangement and power transmission were both part of the spec. It meant that if you wanted to use the Qi2 spec inside your next phone, you had to put the right magnets in the right places.</p><p>This was done so chargers would be universal; you could walk into Best Buy and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=qi+2+charger&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys">buy a Qi2 charger</a> and it would work on any phone. But it meant that most phone makers had to rework their phones so things would fit where they were required to fit. So, aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline</a>, we never saw any flagship phones using Qi2 because no company wanted to go back to the drawing board for a phone that's been in development for several years.</p><p>Some companies will never adopt Qi2 because they have their own proprietary version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomis-new-30w-mi-charge-turbo-fastest-wireless-charging-standard-yet">fast wireless charging</a>. They might add magnets to it, but you won't be able to use their charger on any other brand of phone and get fast charging speeds. It might not work at all. A standard prevents this from happening, and they are generally a good thing.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 was reworked</a>, and the magnetic part became its own standard, it meant that companies would and could adopt better, safer charging specifications. That's a great thing — the changes you don't care about can make a big difference when it comes to efficiency and safety.</p>
<p>Did Samsung do all this on purpose to get you to buy a case? We reached out to Samsung for an official statement and asked if they could share why they chose not to include the MPP on the Galaxy S25. If and when they answer, we'll update this article and publish the statement in its entirety.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps on Android Auto now centers the navigation arrow if you haven’t set a destination yet.</li><li>However, this tweak means that much of the map view around your car will be blocked by the destination box on smaller screens.</li><li>Luckily, the update still shifts the navigation arrow and driving route when a destination is set.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> runs on car screens of many sizes, and although it tries to take a one-size-fits-all approach, that doesn’t always work. As newer cars start shipping with much larger screens with different aspect ratios, Android Auto is occasionally updated to adapt. However, that isn’t always a good thing. Now, a slight tweak to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> view in Android Auto is causing some users to become frustrated, as documented in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1i905xk/google_maps_is_now_centered_on_the_screen/?rdt=43625" target="_blank">Reddit posts</a>.</p><p>Previously, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-android-3d-building-android-auto-sync">running Google Maps on Android Auto</a> without a destination set, the street a user is currently driving on — along with their navigation arrow — would appear off-centered. It was positioned toward the right, to make room for the destination box. The destination box is fairly large, and features the search bar plus a few suggested location. Paired with the settings and buttons to the left of it, the destination box eats into the viewable area of your map.</p><p>That’s where the off-centered street view came in handy. It ensured that the street you’re driving on could be viewed on the map even on small, squarish Android Auto screens. A new OTA update appears to have shifted the navigation arrow, denoting a user’s current position on the map, to the center. This makes it tricky to see what’s in front of you on the street being traveled.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1i905xk/google_maps_is_now_centered_on_the_screen">Google Maps is now centered on the screen</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto">r/AndroidAuto</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The good news is that the Android Auto update doesn’t seem to affect the view when a destination is set. While navigation is active, the navigation arrow and driving route are both shifted right so they are clearly visible. This makes it all the more puzzling why Google would change the user-interface for setting a destination, as Reddit users describe in the comments to the original post.</p><p>The shift only affects cars with smaller and square displays, as widescreen or larger screens have the room to keep the map view visible even while centered. Hiding or minimizing the search bar and suggestions list should help matters, but that’s now another thing Google Maps users on Android Auto have to worry about.</p><p>It’s possible that Google changes or reverts this update in a future one, as it has tweaked the position of the navigation arrow and destination box multiple times in the past. For now, it seems users will have to get used to the central placement of the navigation arrow.</p>

<ul><li>Google has made the PebbleOS source code available for download and free use.</li><li>Original Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky plans to launch a "new Pebble-like smartwatch" with "the same beloved features" as before.</li><li>These features include the trademark e-paper screen, long battery life, and "hackable" software for users.</li><li>Other groups, including the "Rebble" project for recreating Pebble's software, will be able to use Pebble's code for their own watches.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Pebble brand has been dead for nearly a decade, but Google is allowing its devoted fans and former engineers to resurrect PebbleOS by making the code open-source.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/see-code-that-powered-pebble-smartwatches.html">Google Open Source Blog</a> announced the news, sharing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/google/pebble">Github repository</a> for the PebbleOS source code. Although some "proprietary source code" was removed, anyone can take the remaining code and generate a new version of PebbleOS, with functionality like "notifications, media controls, fitness tracking, and support for custom apps and watchfaces" available.</p><p>Pebble watches have a beloved cult following that has persisted well after the company's 2016 sale to Fitbit — which Google acquired (along with Pebble's IP) a few years later. Our editor Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pebble-time-review">reviewed the Pebble Time</a> back in 2015, with a generally positive impression along with some dislikes of its unique design.</p><p>Now Pebble's former founder, Eric Migicovsky, has announced plans to bring back the Pebble brand, launching a new watch with "the same specs and features as Pebble, though with some fun new stuff as well."</p><p>On his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back">personal blog</a>, Migicovsky explains that he "asked friends at Google... if they could open source PebbleOS," and that "over the last year, a team inside Google (including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on this."</p><p>Now that PebbleOS is officially open source, Migicovsky and his "small team" can launch a Pebble clone — even if they can't <em>call</em> the watch "Pebble." Google still owns the name, after all! Considering some Pebble watch owners <em>still</em> wear these watches all these years later, they'll no doubt be eager to see how this new version stands the test of time.</p>

<p>"Lessons were learned last time," Migicovsky admits in his blog post, referring to how he oversaw Pebble's massive popularity burst on Kickstarter, the company's overambitious growth, and its failure to grow to match costs, leading to the need to sell Pebble to Fitbit.</p><p>His 2024 blog post <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/success-and-failure-at-pebble">"Success and failure at Pebble"</a> runs through where things went wrong. He highlighted things like the "too damn big" bezel on the Pebble Time and how they "failed to reposition" Pebble beyond the "hacker" crowd to productivity and fitness users. But the main issue seemed to be a simple case of spending too much money before Pebble was ready to earn enough revenue back.</p><p>With this project, it seems that the new Pebble team plans to stick to its strengths, with a geeky, niche watch that'll appeal to a core group of power users — similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing phones</a> in that space — rather than using massive resources to try and compete with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> or Apple Watches.</p><p>Some of the key features of this hypothetical Pebble successor are, according to Migicovsky's post, a sunlight-readable e-paper screen, long battery life, physical buttons for functions like music controls, and a "hackable" OS that lets you create your own watch faces and apps.</p><p>We're curious to see what new features this team will focus on. Health and fitness tracking are the most obvious growth areas for smartwatches these days, but that might require more resources than this small team can reasonably create.</p><p>I myself wrote last year about how I wished that a watch company would bring back <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-straps-failed-for-reason-but-deserve-second-chance">Pebble smart straps</a>; that's more about hardware than source code, but given how Pebble took such a unique approach, it'll be fascinating to see what old ideas make it into the new version.</p><p>Of course, the Repebble team isn't the only group invested in reviving Pebble. There's also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rebble.io/2025/01/27/the-future-of-rebble.html">Rebble community project</a>, which had been working on a RebbleOS replacement firmware and now have plans to use the PebbleOS source code within their new project. And any other group could shoot their shot at a Pebble-like watch if they want!</p><p>If you're interested in buying — or seeing more info about — Migicovskys mysterious new Pebble successor, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://repebble.com/signup"><strong>sign up</strong></a> on the site for email updates, with the promise to share "full details about the new watch and shipping timeline" and to "prioritize shipping to people on this list first."</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus is rolling out a significant update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> that adds a new app, a new feature, and the January 2025 security patches, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1779149502209327113" target="_blank">post</a> on its community forum. The update, with build number OxygenOS 15.0.0.500, is now becoming available in batches in all markets, including India, Europe, and North America.</p><p>The highlight of this iteration of OxygenOS 15 is the addition of a BeaconLink app. It works like a walkie-talkie and allows to call others nearby even if they don’t have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. While other OnePlus and Oppo phones already received the feature with OxygenOS 15, the OnePlus 12R is just now gaining support. There are limitations, of course — not every device is supported and range is limited to 500m.</p><p>The OnePlus 12R receives another OxygenOS 15 favorite as part of this update, and that’s Touch to Share. It’s an AirDrop alternative for OnePlus phones that’ll make it easier to share photos, files, and more across devices. Files can be shared with Android phones, plus iPhones as well.</p>

<p>Aside from those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15 features</a>, the update includes security patches from the January 2025 revision of the Android Security Bulletin. As such, it’s recommended that OnePlus 12R users update as soon as the new version is available. OnePlus says the rollout will be limited at first, but will open up after a few days. With that in mind, you shouldn’t have to wait long for builds CPH2585_15.0.0.500 (India), CPH2609_15.0.0.500 (Europe/Global markets), or CPH2611_15.0.0.500 (North America) to appear for your device.</p><p>It’s important to note that the update is only available for OnePlus 12R phones already running OxygenOS 15. If you’re still on Android 14, you’ll first need to upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based OxygenOS 15 before this patch will appear.</p>
