<ul><li>Meta seems to be testing out Community Notes for Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.</li><li>With this, it looks to create a more unbiased space for people to share varied perspectives on their platform.</li><li>As this feature is still being tested, it won't show up on the apps as yet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta seems to be taking varied perspectives seriously as it announced today (Mar. 13) that it has begun testing out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/x-removes-option-to-report-misleading-information">Community Notes</a>, similar to what X does on its platform.</p><p>With this feature, users would add more context about a certain topic as contributors on that platform. This will replace the now active third-party fact-checking feature on all of its apps. However, like X, users would first have to sign up to be contributors for this feature. These contributors will be allowed to write and rate notes on content across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.</p><p>"Around 200,000 potential contributors in the US have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.meta.com/technologies/community-notes?utm_medium=vanity&utm_source=meta.me-cn">signed up</a> so far across all three apps, and the waitlist remains open for those who wish to take part in the program," Meta explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/testing-begins-community-notes-facebook-instagram-threads/">press release.</a></p><p>The presser added that it will initially use X's open-source algorithm and build on it for Meta's platforms.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZzMzkyMpvmFoiLqi23iKGL" name="Meta-Community-Notes" alt="Community Notes on Meta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZzMzkyMpvmFoiLqi23iKGL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To be a contributor, users need to be over 18, have an account that’s more than 6 months old, and be in good standing, meaning not flagged for misuse. Other than that, the profile should be two-factor authenticated as well.</p><p>As users start contributing, Meta says the author's names will remain anonymous to protect their privacy and show up as "People added a community note" under the said image/topic. Contributors will be able to submit notes on anything, including stuff posted by Meta, politicians, and other public figures. However, they won't be able to add to advertisements.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="xHn9Fe3Zs9CoHCdtiwpQUL" name="Meta-Community-Notes" alt="Community Notes on Meta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHn9Fe3Zs9CoHCdtiwpQUL.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for how it works, once contributors add their viewpoints on a certain topic limited to 500 characters, it won't be published on a post "unless contributors with a range of viewpoints broadly agree on them."</p><p>"No matter how many contributors agree on a note, it won’t be published unless people who normally disagree decide that it provides helpful context," the presser explained. Additionally, when community notes are added to a specific image/topic, it won't flag the post the way that fact-checking would.</p><p>Meta adds that these notes will not showcase the opinions of the company but will attempt to create a more unbiased platform for people to voice their opinions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="rpnTAevui8FPRFR9D2zbML" name="Meta-Community-Notes" alt="Community Notes on Meta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpnTAevui8FPRFR9D2zbML.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Community Notes will be showcased in six different languages commonly used in the United States. This includes English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French, Portuguese, and other languages will be expanded over time. That said, this feature will first be tested out in the U.S. starting Mar. 18 and then be rolled out to a wider audience.</p>

<ul><li>Google is said to be testing a new UI for incoming calls on its phone app.</li><li>An APK deep dive reveals that it might be ditching the usual swiping up and down mechanism to answer voice calls.</li><li>The new UI looks a lot like how older versions of accepting calls, with a side-to-side mechanism.</li></ul>
<p>Google is reportedly testing out a new way to answer calls on its Phone app. It might be letting go of its usual sliding up and down motion to answer/reject calls to something that looks a lot like a blast from the past.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-incoming-call-ui-changes-apk-teardown-3534690/">APK teardown by Android Authority</a> revealed as much when tested with a phone running on the Phone app's version <strong>v166.0.735169223</strong> beta, the publication added.</p><p>Google apparently wants to change things up with Android 16, and this could include the way we answer phones as well. But instead of bringing a new-looking UI, it seems like it's hitting us with some old-school memories.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hopXtUiQYy8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>As seen in the above video by the publication, it looks like we might be in for a more side-to-side gesture of picking up a call.  It features a pill-shaped bar at the bottom of the screen, with an icon in the center— which can be dragged to the left to decline and right to accept a call. Additionally, you also see a "Message" option above the pill-shaped bar, to send people a text if you choose to decline their calls.</p><p>While Google has stuck to the same UI for years, it would take some practice for the fingers to stop swiping up to pick up a phone call. It remains unclear when this feature will show up on the app itself.</p><p>However, if this change does occur, it can change the way people answer calls not just on Pixel devices but also on all other phones where the Google Phone app comes pre-loaded. This means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> from companies like Motorola, Sony, and others could be graced with the new UI.</p>

<p>Last year, the Google Phone app was<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-give-its-phone-app-a-fresh-coat-of-apple-inspired-paint" target="_blank"> testing out an Apple-like incoming call </a>screen where the accept call button would be staged on the right and the reject button on the left, unlike the other way around on most Samsung phones. This UI showcased color-coded buttons for the action, allowing it to be easily recognizable. While this shift looked promising, it was only being tested on a handful of devices and didn't see a wider rollout.</p><p>Similarly, this redesign could be in a small testing phase as well, but it remains unclear when or if we will ever see this shift in UI. However, to clarify things, Android Central has reached out to Google and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>If you’re in the market for an affordable, entry-level Android phone with premium features, the Nothing Phone 3a vs. Google Pixel 8a are two good options. Both come in at under $500 but have impressive specs that suggest they cost much more. Both employ beautiful designs and software and security support for years. But they are very different phones in terms of the look and what they have to offer that makes them stand out. So, let’s dive deeper into how they compare.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QhWyBvRndrqc5KcRzgtce" name="nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-3a-pro-displays-holding-01" alt="Comparing the displays and sizes between the Nothing Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QhWyBvRndrqc5KcRzgtce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro, which launched in early March 2025, looks like no other phone you have come across with a cool, transparent exterior design that is inspired by Japanese iconography. This includes clean, geometric shapes on a flat surface with straight sides. Nothing (pun intended) on the market looks like this phone, Nicholas Sutrich enthuses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">in his Nothing Phone 3a Pro review</a>.</p><p>Made of high-grade tempered glass with machined aluminum accents and a 6.77-inch 2,392 x 1,080 FHD+ AMOLED, you’ll get a decent 120Hz refresh rate for keeping up with everything from multitasking to gaming. There’s also an impressive up to 3,000 nits brightness, so the phone is viewable in just about any scenario, even direct sunlight.</p><p>The Glyph interface sets it apart. The purpose of this unique design is to help you avoid distractions by using light and sound patterns to indicate notifications and ringtones. Rather than constantly looking at your phone, a unique color and pattern of light will tell you who’s calling, for example, or what type of notification you’re getting. You can also leverage the Glyph interface for things like music playback, a camera timer, and volume.</p><p>Finished in black or grey, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro has a 91.4% screen-to-body ratio and an Essential key on its side for taking screenshots, long pressing to record your voice, or double pressing to open Essential Space. This is a spot that organizes your content, like screenshots, voice notes, and text notes, into neat and logical categories for easy retrieval and action prompts. You can customize the look of widgets and use the smart drawer to automatically organize apps by category.</p><p>Equipped with a 5,000mAh battery, the Nothing Phone 3a can last all day: Sutrich says it even easily lasts beyond a day, up to two for light users. It supports 50W fast charging as well as 7.5W reverse wireless charging. It comes with either 128GB or 256GB non-expandable storage.</p><p>The phone boasts an IP64 rating, so it’s not quite as rugged as others, but Sutrich says it feels durable with a nice, grippy texture, even with the sides being made of plastic. Additional features include Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, fingerprint sensor, face unlock, stereo speakers, and a 360° antenna. It comes with three years of Android OS updates and six years of security updates.</p>

<p>Launched in May 2024, the Google Pixel 8a comes in Aloe, Bay, Porcelain, or Obsidian. With a matte composite back, matte aluminum frame, and Corning Gorilla Glass 3, it has a smaller 6.1-inch Actua 2,400 x 1,080 OLED display with an adaptive refresh rate that can go from 60-120Hz, depending on the task at hand, and up to 2,000 nits peak brightness.</p><p>Sutrich says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">in his Pixel 8a review</a> that the Google Pixel 8a is his favorite in terms of Pixel designs with a unique camera bar, rounded corners, and a “heavenly” feeling matte finish. Even though the back is plastic, he says it doesn’t feel as such, looking and feeling like a more premium device than it is.</p><p>The phone boasts an all-day 4,492mAh battery that can extend to 72 hours using Extreme Battery Saver mode. It supports both 7.5W wireless charging via Qi and 18W fast charging, but Sutrich says it charges very slowly, reaching only 33% after half an hour. Get it with 128GB or 256GB storage.</p><p>Google throws in some nice add-ons with purchases, including three months of Google One with 100GB cloud storage, three months of YouTube Premium, and six months of Fitbit Premium. There are also useful features like Family Link with parental controls if you’re getting this device for a child.</p><p>With an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, the Google Pixel 8a has Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, fingerprint sensor, face unlock, stereo speakers, and two mics with noise suppression. You’ll get support for even longer with seven years of Feature Drops and as long for security support along with built-in Google VPN, Titan M2 security, anti-malware, anti-phishing, and an auto security and privacy hub.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-pro-vs-google-pixel-8a-what-can-these-phones-do-2">Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Google Pixel 8a: What can these phones do?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB" name="Essential-Space-Organized" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s dive into what makes these two phones stand out when it comes to usability and features.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a runs on Nothing OS 3.1, which is based on Android 15. It has a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor with an AI engine and up to 20GB RAM Booster and a Hexagon Tensor Accelerator (HTA) that boosts AI performance. It comes with 8GB or 12GB RAM to keep up with all your daily needs.</p><p>The Essential Space really stands out on this phone, making it simple to organize and catalog all your contents. Soon, the phone will also be able to transcribe on the fly, condense meeting notes, and even pull together to-dos based on your information. Now, it can do things like generate personalized suggestions, summaries, or action points, all leveraging integrated AI.</p><p>Sutrich says Essential Space, which is still in beta, is “very cool” though less useful than he had hoped. It’s basically a digital replacement for a daily planner, and it works well in accomplishing this. How useful you find it will be a personal thing.</p><p>The feature Sutrich really loves and calls a game-changer is the ability to take notes or voice memos on the fly by pressing a single key. As soon as he made a recording, like something he remembered while driving, the AI engine in the phone organized it neatly and provided a summary the next time he looked at his phone.</p><p>Gamers will appreciate the steel vapor chamber, which ensures reduced average versus 60-70FPS on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>. However, he notes that the phone never got warm to the touch and he didn’t experience any performance issues. Nonetheless, his observations are worth keeping in mind if you plan to use the phone for gaming.</p><p>From a security standpoint, all content is stored locally on the phone, and any data sent to the cloud for processing is encrypted and then deleted once the task is done. There’s also built-in ChatGPT.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2B4r9PrJFvsVkAzz87qkVh" name="google-pixel-8a-live-captions.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8a's Live Captions feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2B4r9PrJFvsVkAzz87qkVh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 8a runs on the G3 chip and boasts less RAM at 8GB, but it’s still a pretty powerful phone. It has all the usual Google goodies, including Gemini access and the Gemini assistant, and features like live translate. You can also enjoy features like Circle to Search, call screen, clear calling, hold for me, wait times, and smart replies. Extra safety features include crisis alerts and car crash detection.</p><p>The Family Link area of the phone is useful for parents with teens and tweens who want to be able to monitor usage, set time limits, and ensure they are only accessing appropriate apps and information.</p><p>Performance of this phone varies, Sutrich notes, based on his experience compared to others on the team. While it’s better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Google Pixel 7a</a> in terms of benchmarks, even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a>, some Android Central testers find performance snappy while others found that apps constantly re-loaded when switching among them. Further, anything taxing will drain the battery faster than other phones in this class, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yH8drQwrG4T6WdDmz88hhU" name="nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-3a-pro-back-02" alt="Comparing the transparent backs of the grey Nothing Phone (3a) Pro with the white Nothing Phone (3a)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yH8drQwrG4T6WdDmz88hhU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone loves taking photos with their phones. How do these two stack up?</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro has a 50MP main camera with a Sony sensor combined with a 50MP periscope, 8MP ultra-wide, and an impressive 50MP front camera for selfies. The cameras are arranged with a horizontally stacked lens configuration with 3x optical zoom and up to 60x ultra zoom. The large, circular camera island on the back will be polarizing, notes Sutrich, giving off a dramatic and industrial feel that not everyone will like.</p><p>The 50MP front camera supports 4K video recording as well, with AI-powered stabilization and night capture enhancement. There’s also a useful portrait mode as well as Ultra XDR that can capture 8 RAW frames at varying exposures and merge them for photos with more detail. The TrueLens Engine 3 works in the background to ensure pro-grade images, says the company.</p><p>There are also specific camera controls, including Quick record for instantly recording video, burst shot mode, a zoom indicator, and portrait effects. There are personal presets for camera settings so you can save your favorite ones, with images stored in the native Nothing photo gallery.</p><p>Sutrich says the cameras are good, a massive step up from the Nothing Phone 2a, particularly when it comes to zoom detail. “Overall,” he says, “these are great cameras and help build confidence in the brand and its capabilities.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hFDQajQ6opEiPmzjpfmXeg" name="google-pixel-8a-ai-wallpaper.jpg" alt="AI wallpaper on a Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFDQajQ6opEiPmzjpfmXeg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 8a has some pretty impressive cameras, too. This includes a 64MP quad PD wide main camera, 13MP ultra-wide, and 13MP front. The main difference here is the much lower-resolution front camera, which won’t yield shots as nice as with the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. But you’ll still get decent selfies.</p><p>Where Google excels is with its many popular photo editing and capture features, which appear in all the latest models, including the Google Pixel 8a. These include ones like Best Take, Audio Magic Eraser, Magic Editor, Night Sight, Real Tone, Photo Unblur, and Portrait Mode. There’s also super res zoom up to 8x.</p><p>Sutrich finds that while the Google Pixel 8a takes great photos, you’ll get the same camera performance on the Google Pixel 7a. He finds that the Google Pixel 8a get exposure right in most cases, pulling out plenty of detail. You will get high contrast and color accurate imagery as well, which is a good thing. This phone, however, doesn’t live up to others in the line in terms of capturing objects in motion. So, if you’re looking to take lots of pics of kids or pets, you might want to consider another Pixel model.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-pro-vs-google-pixel-8a-which-should-you-choose-2">Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Google Pixel 8a: Which should you choose?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rTWE6YhWSZMUcsNMXRiCuB" name="Essential-Key-Record" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rTWE6YhWSZMUcsNMXRiCuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s decision time. Between the Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Google Pixel 8a, which should you choose? Both are wonderful phones for affordable prices. With the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, you get a cool, stand-out look that will turn heads and have people asking you what phone that is, where you got it, and if it’s any good. By comparison, the Google Pixel 8a looks plainer in comparison, but it’s one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">the best cheap Android phones</a> you can buy right now, providing tremendous value for dollar.</p><p>While the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is newer, the Google Pixel 8a offers more than two times the length of software support, through 2031 whereas software support for the Nothing Phone 3a Pro will end by 2028. That might not sound like a big deal, but even if you don’t plan to keep either phone that long, the Google Pixel 8a will have better resale or trade-in value since it has so much life left in it.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8a is slightly more durable but the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is more powerful if you opt for the 12GB RAM version. The Essential Space in the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, while still a work in progress, makes use of AI in a practical way that will only get better over time as well.</p><p>Keep in mind that if you love the Nothing Phone 3a Pro but want to save even more, you can step down to the Nothing Phone 3a, which is more affordable with marginal differences, including slightly less capable cameras without a periscope option. Comparatively, the Google Pixel 7a is still a great budget phone with plenty of years of support still left, and the same camera performance as the Google Pixel 8a. So, if you’re on a super tight budget, these are both solid alternatives that you can find for even less.</p><p>Otherwise, if you want something totally different in terms of look and feel, you might appreciate the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. For something simpler and more traditional in design that still packs a punch in performance, the Google Pixel 8a won’t disappoint.</p>

<p>Orion Drift, the latest game from the creators of Gorilla Tag, went into open Early Access on February 25 and it gave me the chance to finally spend time in a public lobby. Previously, I had only played with a few other players after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gorilla-tag-creator-talks-new-game-orion-drift">interviewing the game's creator</a> at Meta Connect 2024. Playing in a public lobby is an entirely different ballgame.</p><p>Like Gorilla Tag, Orion Drift is free-to-play, and movement is driven primarily by your arms. But that's really where the similarities end, as your hand-mounted "skate ball," as I'll call it, lets you drift around like a robot that's watched too many Fast & Furious movies. Things only get wilder when you activate the thrusters on each hand, turning this game into a unique combination of Rocket League, Echo VR, and, of course, Gorilla Tag.</p><p>While Gorilla Tag's movement is interesting and does a great job of reducing motion sickness some players experience with virtual movement in VR, I never found myself returning to that game. Things are <em>very</em> different with Orion Drift, as I've found myself jumping back in again and again to try new things, see new places, and meet new people. Getting better at Driftball is a nice side effect, too.</p>

<p>Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/echo-vr-season-1-hands">Echo VR</a> before it, Orion Drift's core gameplay revolves around social sports that can't exist in real life. Sure, they're loosely based on actual sports — currently, you can play golf, basketball, parkour/rock climbing, and driftball — but only the most basic core mechanics from those games remain intact.</p><p>You can't hold a ball in Orion Drift; you can only hit it. This makes it a bit like Rocket League mixed with basketball or volleyball, to draw some kind of comparison. Likewise, parkour is similar to real-life parkour but enhanced thanks to the low gravity of the space station and the rocket boosters on your wrists.</p><p>Parkour isn't just a free-for-all showoff section, though. Players can enter Scrap Runs at scheduled times, a game broken into two teams where one team tries to get to the end of the course while the other team attempts to sabotage them in the process. It's chaotic and a <em>ton</em> of fun.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The community welcomed me right away, showing me the ropes, where to go, and how to have fun.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Golf is where things really start to <em>drift</em> away from their real-world counterparts. These courses look like traditional golf courses — green fields, water and sand traps, trees — but the mechanics are more like frisbee golf meets Rocket League. Yes, again, with the Rocket League comparisons, but it's hard not to make them.</p><p>You won't be using a club; it's just your hands and an innate sense of accuracy. You're hitting a ball at full force with as much momentum as you can build up, trying to get it in the basket at the end of the course.</p><p>But these three sports are all still in development. The real bread-and-butter of Orion Drift is Driftball, a game whose closest real-world counterpart is probably Soccer. Arenas are multi-tiered like those found in Echo VR, but this isn't a zero-gravity experience, even if a lot of mechanics feel similar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UrKFKrBxymdsQHJhrVCnuJ" name="orion-drift-official-screenshot-rock-climbing" alt="An official screenshot from Orion Drift on Meta Quest 3, showcasing group rock climbing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UrKFKrBxymdsQHJhrVCnuJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Sure it's free-to-play, but that doesn't mean it has to be ruined by "sweats" or kids. Different servers have different rules, which may mean adults-only, parkour-only, etc.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>You can grab the ground and throw yourself to gain some initial momentum, and the hand-mounted thrusters can temporarily propel you higher or farther for a short boost. Boost power can be refilled by collecting one of the containers that spawn on the field, so you'll need to use the power wisely.</p><p>Like Echo VR, you can grab other players and hold on like a jockey, encouraging teamwork and unique skill-building you won't find anywhere else. This can also be done while touring the station, not just during a game, which makes it a handy tool for newcomers and friends traveling to the same place.</p><p>Like any sport, Driftball is something you'll need to practice a lot to get good at. The game has plenty of practice courts, including automated ones, half courts to practice shots with other players, and even separate servers to keep casual players from getting intimidated by "sweats."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TTNpVeWmtPsGDwy9h4p2tJ" name="orion-drift-official-screenshot-scrap-run" alt="An official screenshot from Orion Drift on Meta Quest 3, showcasing a Scrapper Run game" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TTNpVeWmtPsGDwy9h4p2tJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One look at the reviews for the game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/orion-drift/7181769438517329/">on the Meta Horizon store</a> tells you everything you need to know. This isn't just a "game." It's a place you visit and keep coming back to because you love it.</p><p>Central to the Orion Drift experience is a sense of community that most games lack. I'd call it a "metaverse" in that you're together with 75 people at any given time — a number that's set to increase to 200 players once the game hits version 1.0. However, the difference here is that your character doesn't leave the game. It's a fully enclosed system with its own set of specific, customizable character models.</p><p>While the game starts with you alone in a spaceship, you'll quickly choose from a list of available servers or just hit the "quick join" button if you don't care about the server category. All interactions in the game are with your hands, not a laser pointer or some other UI paradigm that makes you feel like you're playing a game. Like Gorilla Tag, this is designed to feel like a world you live in and interact with.</p><p>My first time at the station was filled with friendly interactions that I'm simply not used to in public games. As I meandered around and figured out the locomotion system, a friendly player came up to me and asked how my day was going. After a brief conversation and the admission that this was my first time in the game, he asked me to hop on his back so I could take a station tour.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>This isn't just a "game." It's a place you visit and keep coming back to because you love it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This was the first magical moment I encountered, and it's stuck with me ever since. Each Orion station is massive. Truly and utterly huge, with a design that feels a lot like a Halo planet. Look up at any time, and you'll get a full view of the rest of the station, including an idea of where you might want to travel to next.</p><p>The station is broken up into districts. Right now, there are "only" three — Driftball, Club (golf), and Parkour — but there are around a dozen different potential districts in development. Zero Gravity is next after Parkour is finished, which should give hardcore Echo VR users something to really celebrate.</p><p>Each district is a flat area that is surprisingly huge. Many districts include multiple levels — the Parkous District has a massive underground area while the Club District has floating golf courses — and each district is separated by free-floating space to keep things distinct.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8j9RHwiim6tMfsnub79kvJ" name="orion-drift-official-screenshot-customization" alt="An official screenshot from Orion Drift on Meta Quest 3, showcasing customization with lots of players" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8j9RHwiim6tMfsnub79kvJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first time I grabbed a "zipline" and traveled to another district was surreal. Ziplines are fast but not overly so, avoiding the feeling of motion sickness that some games can cause by only sending players along a forward line rather than introducing any kind of lateral turning motion.</p><p>Likewise, the locomotion system has been proven to help reduce motion sickness, all while introducing more advanced concepts than were available in Gorilla Tag. Drifting with hand skates feels amazing and delivers a realistic sense of speed and momentum that makes me feel like I'm actually doing it, not just standing in the middle of my living room.</p><p>It's this feeling and sense of movement that sticks with me for a while after the end of every session. When I take my headset off, I still have a faint feeling like I should be back in the space station with my fellow Drifters.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The game already has tens of thousands of players, with servers that'll soon support 200 players concurrently, making this a very vibrant, alive collection of worlds.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Anyone who is interested in the game should join the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.gg/oriondrift">Orion Drift Discord</a>, a community that has already reached <strong>50,000 people</strong> in a very short time. Even if you don't want to join it, the game has a calendar listing of events scattered throughout the districts on bulletin boards.</p><p>It's this welcoming community that's made the game feel so immediately palpable — the excellent structure and gameplay mechanics were just the cherry on top — and has kept me coming back after learning the basics. The game even has dedicated servers for parkour or golf, so you can jump right in and ensure a full field of competitors and teammates.</p><p>Even if you're worried about "squeaking kids," there are adults-only fleets in the game that'll kick any player who doesn't meet the age limits. This is the first time in a long time that I've felt like a game is directly addressing the Echo VR community and trying to fill in the wound Meta left <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ready-at-dawn-studios-closing">when it closed Ready at Dawn</a> for good. Another Axiom has done it again, and this time, it feels like everyone can truly enjoy the spectacle.</p>

<p>Garmin and Samsung are both great watchmakers in their own respect. However, pitting the Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra reveals that each wearable is suited for a different type of user.</p><p>Right off the bat, the steep price difference stands out the most. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8 </a>is the same price as the top-tier Galaxy S25 Ultra smartphone. Your bank account will definitely feel the hit from that expenditure. Garmin's ultra-premium wearable gives you insanely high-end and comprehensive health and fitness features though, which some might call a fair trade.</p><p>The real question is whether you should save more than half of that cost and opt for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> instead. Let's break it down to understand.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-fenix-8-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-specifications-2">Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Specifications</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qw6TDQtQPLtcSn5Xc9qwHH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 5" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qw6TDQtQPLtcSn5Xc9qwHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Garmin didn't disclose much detailed information about the Fenix 8, so the processor of the smartwatch is unknown. On the other hand, Samsung is a lot more transparent about what you get for your money.</p><p>Strangely, the Garmin Fenix 8 is missing any form of LTE 4G connectivity, so right off the bat the Galaxy Watch Ultra wins if you absolutely must have cellular support on your wrist.</p><p>Another key difference is that the Galaxy Watch Ultra runs Wear OS, so it naturally offers a much wider assortment of third-party app support. Garmin OS isn't bad, but isn't nearly as versatile and doesn't offer as many apps as any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">best Wear OS watches</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sqdFhWDNv7iqLQVbhPhjXH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 3" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sqdFhWDNv7iqLQVbhPhjXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Fenix 8 and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra are both super powerful watches, promising days upon days of battery life. Where the Samsung wearable delivers 40 hours of uptime with the AOD enabled, the Fenix 8 gives it a run for its money with a week or two's worth of battery life.</p><p>Speaking about his experience while testing the Fenix 8, our reviewer Michael L Hicks stated that the watch lasts two weeks for him including lots of multi-band GPS tracking, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra might last four days at most or two to three days with heavy use.</p><p>The Garmin Fenix 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra weigh about the same, but that's only for the Titanium variation of the Fenix 8. The Watch Ultra's display is brighter and larger, but the Fenix 8's display is still bright enough in most cases and doesn't have as much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-smartwatches-have-a-flicker-problem-the-oneplus-watch-3-fixed-it" target="_blank">flickering.</a> All in all, you can easily use both wearables outdoors and have high visibility under the sun.</p><p>Garmin does a better job of connecting to external devices like heart rate monitors or cycling power meters over Bluetooth or ANT+. This is a shortcoming of Wear OS watches and not just the Galaxy Watch Ultra, because they just aren't very good at that in general.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="KUgQCUghU98sDNnB7UcBLH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 4" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KUgQCUghU98sDNnB7UcBLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3720" height="2092" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Garmin OS isn't anywhere near as versatile with app support as Wear OS. Garmin doesn't have an app store, but you do get access to a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming apps</a> such as Spotify, YouTube Music, and Amazon Music. There are other apps for the weather and integrations with fitness apps like Komoot as well.</p><p>Since Wear OS is made by Google, Google Maps naturally runs smoother on the Galaxy Watch for navigation. However, Garmin has better offline topographical maps and creatable handy routes for workouts.</p><p>The UI is quite different across both wearables. The Galaxy Watch Ultra has tiles for various apps. Meanwhile, Garmin has widgets that focus on key health and fitness data. Samsung obviously has the edge when it comes to UI, but it's worth noting that the Fenix 8's UI is better than most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>.</p><p>The fundamental difference between the two watches is the level of advanced health and workout tools and features offered. Samsung still doesn't do training loads, fitness plans, daily suggested workouts, or other key Garmin tools. But it does have something called Energy Score, which is pretty similar to Garmin's Body Battery metric.</p><p>The Fenix 8 offers some of the most in-depth metrics, data tracking, and training tools for any fitness-focused individual. It can even take naps into account, among thousands of other workout and sports-related features. Garmin also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">improved its indoor workouts</a>, something Micheal had been wishing for a while. The only real issue is that all Garmin watches have the Garmin Coach, so you can probably wait for a while and get this feature on a much cheaper Garmin wearable eventually.</p><p>Finally, both the Garming and Samsung watches have highly accurate GPS and heart rate sensors. Based on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch Ultra fitness test</a>, Michael estimates that the Watch Ultra isn't that far off from the Fenix 8 for GPS accuracy. At the end of the day though, Garmin is the best in the industry. Therefore, the Fenix 8 is generally better at both, especially when it comes to high-intensity workouts.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-fenix-8-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-which-should-you-buy-2">Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kgPVJU79cZZtCFMd8X9CpH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 2" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kgPVJU79cZZtCFMd8X9CpH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4029" height="2266" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The final comparison left to do is the price. Once you've weighed the pros and cons of both smartwatches, it becomes very obvious that the Garmin Fenix 8 is far too expensive. The wearable doesn't have any noteworthy feature that stands out starkly. There's nothing unique enough or impressive enough that jumps out and justifies that thousand-dollar price tag.</p><p>As Michael said in his Fenix 8 review, if you've got a fancy vacation home in Tahoe or a regular surfing spot near your home in Santa Cruz, then you probably have the money to buy the Fenix 8 and not worry much about the high cost. In that case, you'll get the most out of the smartwatch and enjoy it without wincing at the thought of the money it cost you.</p><p>However, the common man is going to call it a day and stick with the significantly cheaper Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra instead. The watch launched at $650, but it's constantly on sale. Even at the time of writing, you can get one for just $420. And that's with LTE support, which is something the Fenix 8 lacks. Besides, the Samsung watch also comes with Wear OS and almost as accurate HR and GPS sensors.</p><p>So unless you're a serious athlete making bank, I'd suggest you grab the Galaxy Watch Ultra for less than half the price of the Fenix 8.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is rolling out an Always On Display update for its One UI 7 devices (the Galaxy S25 series).</li><li>The patch focuses on improving the experience behind its notification management, as well as giving users more agency with Google Sports.</li><li>Samsung confirmed One UI 7 will go live for eligible Galaxy devices in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is looking to refine the experience of its Now Bar for users, which should make things clear and easy.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-aod-update-improves-google-sports-integration-now-bar/">SammyGuru</a>, Samsung is rolling out an update for the Always On Display for devices with One UI 7 (basically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 series</a>). The update itself is light; however, it focuses on making the experience much easier for users looking to utilize the Now Bar more effectively. According to the publication, the update brings a "notice" about notifications via the Now Bar.</p><p>When in the Now Bar settings, users may see a "App notifications are turned off" label under apps that fit the bill. Users should be able to dive in and change anything that needs to, if it's an app that you need to see more prominently on the lock screen's Now Bar.</p><p>Elsewhere, the update's changelog states it adds a "Google Sports settings guide" alongside an "improved Google Sports-related GUI."</p><p>The publication's findings show that users diving into the Now Bar's settings and tapping Google Sports will see a "Sports from Google Settings" button. From there, a pop-up will surface with professional sports leagues with "Following" and "Recommended" tabs. There, users can more easily select which teams — or even leagues — they'd like to be displayed on their Now Bar.</p><p>These updates are appearing with v8.8.25.5 of the Always on Display app for Samsung.</p>

<p>In other news, Samsung recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-good-lock-launcher-refresh-update-rolls-out">pushed an update</a> for its Good Lock app launcher for Galaxy devices. The patch was minimalistic as it offered small changes to the language used when explaining functions. The patch notes stated Samsung was also "improving app stabilization" for users, though it failed to explicitly state which apps are affected.</p><p>To go along with One UI 7, Samsung highlighted a complete <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">Good Lock overhaul</a> for its next-gen OS. While the company's smartphones will see updates, the redesign focused a lot on its foldables by improving the "overall composition" of the app's UI.</p><p>While this Always On Display update leaves most Galaxy users out of the loop, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">confirmed</a> One UI 7 is arriving in April. After a lengthy history of delays, it seems most of the kinks and frustrations have been ironed out to a place Samsung is comfortable. Additionally, with One UI 7 coming to devices next month, the company is planning Beta Programs for other devices.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 have already received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">the first beta</a>. The company states there's more to come for the likes of the Galaxy S23 series and Galaxy Tab S10 series.</p>

For a limited time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/home/internet/5g/"><strong>you can join Verizon Home Internet on the 5G Home Plus plan and choose between a free 43-inch Samsung TV or a Meta Quest 3S, no strings attached</strong></a>. The gifts may seem a bit random, but knowing how rare Meta Quest deals are, I&apos;m not about to start complaining.</p><p>Starting at $55 per month, Verizon&apos;s 5G Home Plus plan comes with ultra-fast internet speeds and Ultra HD 4K streaming, a free Wi-Fi extender for "whole-home" coverage, and a three-year price guarantee. If you&apos;re already using one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon&apos;s wireless plans</a>, you&apos;ll also get a free perk credit added to your account. This monthly credit can be used on perks like a Netflix and Max (with ads) subscription, the Disney Bundle, and more. </p>

<p>Ready for a new internet provider? Join Verizon Home Internet with the 5G Home Plus plan and you'll get to choose between a free Meta Quest 3S headset or a 43-inch Samsung TV, values of $299.99 and $329.99, respectively. Deals on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headsets</a> are quite uncommon, so unless you <em>really</em> need a TV, I'd recommend opting for the Quest.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/home/internet/5g/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1a2ee433-1a17-4c73-b581-3f197412b957" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sign up for the 5G Home Plus plan and get a FREE Meta Quest 3S or Samsung TV at Verizon" data-dimension48="Sign up for the 5G Home Plus plan and get a FREE Meta Quest 3S or Samsung TV at Verizon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>This isn&apos;t the first time that Verizon has offered free gifts for home internet customers, but it&apos;s the first time that I&apos;ve seen a Meta Quest included in the promo. If you&apos;re unfamiliar, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a> is essentially Meta&apos;s attempt at bringing VR entertainment into the mainstream. The console boasts most of the same hardware and processing power found in the more-expensive Quest 3, plus you&apos;ll get mixed-reality passthrough, 8GB of RAM, and access to the full library of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta games and apps</a>. </p><p>The downside is that you&apos;ll have to deal with a last-gen lens and a narrower field of view than the Quest 3, but if you&apos;re new to VR, it&apos;s unlikely that you&apos;ll even notice. It&apos;s also worth mentioning that the upcoming spring sales might come with some Meta Quest discounts, but if you&apos;re looking for a new internet provider AND you want to get into VR gaming, this is an awesome opportunity. </p>

<p>Today (Mar. 13), Google highlighted a host of Gemini app updates and features users can soon expect.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/new-gemini-app-features-march-2025/">blog post</a>, Google announced a series of improvements en route for Gemini, beginning with the 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. According to the post, this upgrade for the model gives Gemini the ability to accept "new features," such as file uploads. More importantly, Google states the upgraded model gives Gemini more capabilities to break down prompts into "a series of steps" for better responses.</p><p>The 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model also gives Gemini Advanced users a 1M context token window to understand/compute complex problems.</p>

<p>Those who utilize <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">the Gemini app</a> regularly are in for a more personalized treat as Google rolls out a major update. The company says, beginning today (Mar 13), users will notice an experimental feature called "personalization." This is powered by the upgraded 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model to connect your Google apps and services with Gemini.</p><p>The company states this is done to facilitate a "tailored" experience that <em>should </em>fit your needs, should you desire. The test will initially begin by leveraging your behavior in Search. As an example, Google states users looking for restaurant recommendations will see Gemini dive into your Search history for anything food-related.</p><p>Google states users can enable the personalization test in Gemini by selecting its option via the "Model" drop-down menu. The post adds that users remain in control of Gemini and can disable this feature whenever they like.</p><p>Speaking of leveraging connecting apps, Google says it's bringing more services to Gemini, like Calendar, Notes, Tasks, and Photos via 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental. Due to this, Gemini is said to have better capabilities to process complex queries that involve multiple Google apps. As an example, a user could ask Gemini to discover a recipe on YouTube, add the necessary ingredients to a shopping list, <em>and </em>find the nearest store.</p><p>Google then teased additional integration between Gemini and the Photos app, so users can ask for help/questions "based on your photos."</p><p>Lastly, Google announces that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini#:~:text=a%20specific%20conversation.-,Gems%3A,-Gemini%20Advanced%20lets">Gemini's Gems</a> — which lets users create their own personalized AI — are rolling out for "everyone at no cost" in the app.</p>

Today, Google states Deep Research will benefit from the 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model for "enhanced" functions.</p><p>Google says this will concern "all stages:" planning, searching, and reasoning, as well as analyzing and reporting.</p><p>With this upgrade, users will discover deeper insights into <em>how </em>Gemini thinks while it's attempting to fulfill your query. Users will see, in real-time, Gemini's web searches and how it compiles the information for your viewing pleasure once it's done.</p><p>To celebrate the update, Google announces Deep Research is coming to all users globally within the Model drop-down menu in Gemini. However, Google states users can "try Deep Research a few times a month at no cost, and Gemini Advanced users get expanded access to Deep Research to save even more time on their most complex projects."</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is breaking its silence over the recent string of internal testing rumors for its Android 16-based OS release.</p><p>In response to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Questions/One-Ui-8-Beta/m-p/3167416#M35">community post</a>, a One UI Beta team member states there's nothing official (yet) about One UI 8 for stable users or testers. The thread started with questions regarding the supposed start of One UI 8 testing on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 "outside the U.S." Samsung's response to this is "One UI 8.0 has not been officially announced or released for any devices."</p><p>The OP (original poster) cited a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-begins-testing-one-ui-8-0-for-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6/">SammyGuru</a>, which highlights alleged evidence of a test underway for One UI 8 on the Flip 6 and Fold 6 in India.</p><p>The One UI Beta member states that while rumors have brought awareness to "certain devices" with One UI 8, "these are likely internal Samsung test units." They add that these devices are typically "used for early-stage development and are not available for public use."</p><p>Samsung encourages users to keep tabs on its official channels for any updates regarding future One UI betas or rollouts. Nothing official has arrived for enrolled testers yet, which is good (in a way) considering there's something more important we still need.</p>

<p>Most consumers haven't even gotten their promised One UI 7 update yet and rumors have already veered toward an "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">earlier</a>" One UI 8. A tipster on X claimed Samsung may skip the typically expected in between updates for its Android 15-based One UI 7 update. They suggest the possibility of a "One UI 7.1" or "7.1.1" is out of the question as the company could drop Galaxy users right into One UI 8 after.</p><p>Meanwhile, we saw similar rumors about internal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-bring-one-ui-8-sooner">One UI 8 testing</a> for the Galaxy S25 crop up just recently. Another tipster on X posted a few alleged build numbers for the series and the next software iteration. Unlike the other rumor, this Galaxy S25 specific one didn't mention the country this was spotted in. Regardless, as we've seen from Samsung's One UI Beta team, it's simply internal/early stage development progress for now.</p><p>Samsung's One UI 7 has been hit with a severe amount of delays, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">its fourth beta</a> arrived toward the end of February. While Samsung has grappled with various issues, it finally confirmed One uI 7 will arrive for all eligible Galaxy devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">in April</a>.</p><p>But speculation on an earlier One UI 8 comes as Google is fast-tracking its Android 16 update. Google is interested in launching its next major Android OS in Q2 2025. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">Android 16 Beta 2</a> arrived for enrolled Pixels in February, which is right on schedule with what it foresees for the next upgrade.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/03/the-third-beta-of-android-16.html" target="_blank">officially dropped</a> a new beta version of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> update today (Mar. 13), which is set to debut in June.</p><p>In a press release, the company said that Android 16 Beta 3 has reached the "Platform Stability" stage and that this will be available to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">enrolled users, including those with Pixels</a>.</p><p>This means that all in-app behaviors are final, i.e., the actions that users will take within a certain app. And app developers have been given a final call to make necessary changes to their apps to avoid compatibility issues with the updated OS.</p><p>Every Beta version comes with its own set of fun features, but this time, Google is keeping it short. It stated that since this is the last stage of the OS development cycle, "there are only a few new things in the Android 16 Beta 3 release." Let's break it down for you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oWFyzQd3RCcSWmrNSTdUjg" name="Android16-Beta-3-text-outline" alt="Screenshot showing the text outline feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oWFyzQd3RCcSWmrNSTdUjg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Text with enhanced contrast before(left) and after(right) Android 16's new outline text accessibility feature </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First off, this beta version is bringing a new accessibility tool for those with low vision who struggle to read texts due to certain contrast sensitivity. To help these users, the OS will outline text and change the background color of the text box, making the text pop and increasing legibility. The image above provides an example of what this will look like.</p><p>Secondly, along with this feature, it will also bring something called "Local Network Protection," which will essentially act as a gatekeeper for home devices. It will seek permission when an app tries to access/connect to devices like printers, smart TVs, or any other gadget that shares your Wi-Fi or Data — giving more control to the user. Google adds that developers can opt-in for this feature to "test your app and identify any parts that rely on local network access."</p>
<h2 id="auracast-support-for-hearing-aids-2">Auracast support for hearing aids</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Uqxr59qzLbWWsE3PsiDZDP" name="Auracast-experience-airport-smartphone-IFA-2024.jpg" alt="A phone connected to another phone's Auracast broadcast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uqxr59qzLbWWsE3PsiDZDP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Along with the above features, Google is finally bringing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a>" support to Pixels, which allows audio to be broadcast from one source to several others. This also offers additional accessibility as it's compatible with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/auracast-hearing-aids-earbuds/">hearing aids and earbuds</a>.</p><p>For instance, people with hearing aids may miss out on important announcements that happen in public spaces like train stations or concerts due to extensive external noise. However, with Auracast's support, users can directly tune into Auracast broadcasts from compatible devices like TV streamers to receive direct audio streams to their hearing aids. This feature also gives users the ability to personalize their broadcast streams.</p><p>It is important to note that only LE audio-compatible hearing aids from companies like GN Hearing and Starkey are supported. Samsung Galaxy devices with One UI 7 (Android 15) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> devices running the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">Android 16 beta</a> can be connected to public streams.</p><p>"To make access to streams convenient for all, we also partnered together on a QR code standard to connect to broadcasts without needing to go into your settings," the press release added. People with Pixel 9 devices have first dibs on QR code access.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.50%;"><img id="tPBTwCr3Xojm6DhmHUi96G" name="Android-16-beta-3-platform-stability" alt="Android 16 beta timeline, March 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPBTwCr3Xojm6DhmHUi96G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="408" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, Google states that it's in the homestretch before it publicly releases Android 16 to the masses. That said, there could be a few more final beta releases before the launch set to happen by the end of June. "We’re putting additional energy into working with our device partners to bring the Q2 release to as many devices as possible," the company said.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the past few weeks, Retroid has been drip-feeding everyone with little bits of information about its upcoming Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and Pocket Classic. With all of the specs and colors revealed, all that was left was price and availability. This morning, Retroid did just that, as it shared how much both of these new gaming handhelds.</p><p>As such, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/retroid-pocket-flip-2-launch">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a> is set to retail for either $229 or $189, depending on whether you want the Dimensity 1100 or Snapdragon 865. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/retroid-pocket-classic-launch">Retroid Pocket Classic</a> will set you back either $119 for the 4GB+64GB model or $129 for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1888px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:122.03%;"><img id="4dvLrB74FG3ZpmX7u8cHb6" name="retroid-pocket-flip-2-pocket-classic-price-availability" alt="Pricing and availability overview for the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and Pocket Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4dvLrB74FG3ZpmX7u8cHb6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1888" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plus, once pre-orders open on March 17, Retroid is offering a $10 discount on the Flip 2 and $5 on the Classic before jumping up to the retail price once these go on sale. However, Retroid is <em>also</em> offering a "Combo," which saves you $30 and includes both the Snapdragon 865-powered Pocket Flip 2 and the 6GB/128GB Pocket Classic.</p><p>Sure, it's only $30, but for that, you're getting <em>two</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android gaming handhelds</a>. What makes this special isn't the price; you'll have different form factors to enjoy. So, if you're out and about and want to play some retro games, just stick the Classic in your <em>pocket</em> before you leave. And when you're home, sit back and relax with the larger screen and better ergonomics of the Pocket Flip 2.</p><p>While the Pocket Flip 2 and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/snapdragon-870-vs-snapdragon-888-vs-snapdragon-865">Snapdragon 865</a> SoC might seem a bit outdated, it still offers plenty of power for both emulation and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">Android games</a>. But there's a good chance that it will have another trick up its sleeve, and that's the ability to emulate Xbox and even PS3 games.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edLufPR6iGi4FRufzh2Yu5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-15" alt="AYANEO Pocket Micro with Retroid Pocket 5 and Anbernic RG406H" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edLufPR6iGi4FRufzh2Yu5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No, you won't find an Xbox emulator on the Play Store or hiding in a GitHub repo. However, after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld?srsltid=AfmBOor9oGxGTjdBxrcYFtQDl7ZqO9S-spc_AKYg7XfsX0DM_dIJn2vc">Retroid Pocket 5</a> was released late last year, it wasn't long before Linux gaming firmware was made available. Both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rocknix.org/">ROCKNIX</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wiki.batocera.org/choose_a_handheld#retroid_pocket_5_retroid_pocket_mini">Batocera</a> can be downloaded and installed, making it possible to play Xbox games on your "Android" handheld.</p><p>That's not even the best part: you don't lose access to Android if you want to try either of these out. The installation steps are fairly tedious, but you're not actually installing the software to the internal storage on the Pocket 5. Instead, you just flash it to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> from your computer.</p><p>Once that's done, pop in the microSD card, hold down one of the volume buttons while restarting, and a few minutes later, you'll have a Linux gaming handheld. And if you want to switch back over to play some Android games, all you have to do is take out the microSD card and restart. Then, you'll be right back into the native Android experience that Retroid provides.</p>

<p>All of this is made possible thanks to the Snapdragon 865, which is exactly the same chip that we're getting in the Retroid Pocket Flip 2. While I assume some tweaks will have to be made to account for the clamshell form factor, there's no reason to believe that we won't get ROCKNIX and Batocera on the Flip 2.</p><p>Although much of our focus is more on Android gaming handhelds, those only account for a fraction of the market. There are so many more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/black-friday-gaming-handhelds">retro gaming handhelds</a> out there, with the majority of them that make use of Linux-based firmware. But with the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and the Pocket Classic, you won't have to pick and choose.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Photos announced on Wednesday that it is finally rolling out an "undo backup" option to its mobile app on Android. This option showed up on iPhones late last year, and now it has made its way into Android devices.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/330429602/you-now-have-more-control-over-your-backed-up-photos-videos">support page </a>detailing the change, Google stated that this  option will now give users "more control over your backed up photos & videos." This essentially means that users can delete media files that have been backed up on the Google Photos app and not worry about it vanishing from the device itself, which was usually the case until now.</p><p>This Undo device backup feature will help users free up some storage space on their cloud without worrying about losing their media files. This is for when you “might not want all of your photos on your device backed up anymore.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="2rXUGo98FEinnwkpag4XQj" name="Google-photos-locked-folder.jpg" alt="Google Photos Locked Folder" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2rXUGo98FEinnwkpag4XQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, it is important to know that once you delete your photos on Google Photos, they will also be deleted from other spaces on the cloud, like shared albums, memories, and other albums you may have created within the app. Furthermore, photos and videos within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-locked-folder-google-photos">Locked folder</a> will be deleted from the app.</p><p>That said, here's how you can free up some space on your Google Photos cloud with "undo device backup."</p><p><strong>Open the Google Photos app on your phone > tap your Profile picture or initial > Photos settings > Backup > tap on</strong> <strong>Undo backup for this device.</strong></p><p>You will then be prompted to check a box confirming the action. After that, hit Delete Google Photos backup. Once you do this, the app will no longer store the deleted photos, and backup to the device will be turned off automatically.</p><p>In other news, Google Photos is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-losing-a-feature-your-long-distance-family-loved">reportedly</a> cutting off access to automatic syncing for digital photo frames like Aura and Cozyla. This move was made in an attempt to prevent third-party apps from accessing Google Photos, boosting user privacy.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>After the Honey scandal, Google tightened its rules to stop shady affiliate link practices in Chrome extensions.</li><li>Instead of just finding deals, Honey was secretly swapping affiliate links, cutting creators and influencers out of their earnings.</li><li>Google’s new rules demand transparency, banning extensions from messing with shopping cookies or adding affiliate links without clear user consent.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The recent uproar over PayPal’s Honey extension, mainly its shady handling of affiliate links, has pushed Google to tighten the reins on its policies. The new rules lay down clear, strict guidelines for extensions, putting an end to the kind of sketchy behavior that sparked the whole fiasco in the first place.</p><p>Despite its claim to help users find the best deals and coupons, the Honey link scandal exposed a sneaky tactic of secretly swapping in affiliate links. This move siphoned potential earnings away from content creators and influencers who rely on those commissions.</p><p>Following the revelations, Google is tightening the rules on shopping extensions in the Chrome Web Store, as officially announced on its developer support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/affiliate-ads" target="_blank">portal</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/google-chrome-affiliate-extension-policy-honey/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>For the uninitiated, Honey is a Chrome extension owned by PayPal that helps users find coupon codes at checkout. In exchange, it activates PayPal’s affiliate link, earning the company a commission on purchases made through the extension.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vc4yL3YTwWk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Unfortunately, it turned out Honey was slapping its affiliate link on purchases left and right, even when it didn’t find any usable coupon codes. On top of that, it was caught swapping out existing affiliate links, effectively hijacking commissions that would’ve gone to others.</p>
<h2 id="a-win-for-transparency-2">A win for transparency</h2>
<p>Moving forward, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> extensions can only use affiliate links, discount codes, and cookies if they offer a clear, direct benefit at checkout, like real discounts or cash rebates. Extensions also can’t mess with shopping cookies or add affiliate links without upfront, transparent disclosure to users.</p><p>The new policy requires extensions to inject affiliate links only when triggered by a direct user action; a rule that effectively shuts down Honey’s old tactics.</p><p>The “related user action” rule is highlighted by cracking down on shady practices like: secretly tweaking shopping cookies while users browse online stores, sneaking in or swapping affiliate codes into URLs without permission, and slapping on or replacing promo codes without the user’s knowledge.</p><p>The Honey link fallout hurt creators and influencers, but the policy changes that came out of it is a win for everyone. They ensure Chrome extensions do what they promise, making the platform more transparent and trustworthy for users.</p>

<ul><li>Google is launching an earn-back program for native PC games, offering up to 15% additional revenue.</li><li>The company is also introducing new developer tools to enhance gameplay across multiple devices.</li><li>Google Play Games on PC will be available on more devices, including AMD laptops, and desktops.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has announced that it’s expanding support for native PC games with a new earn-back program. With the Game Developers Conference (GDC) underway, the search giant has also announced that it is bringing users more games and more ways to play games across devices.</p><p>At GDC, the company will be showcasing all games coming to Google Play, and additionally, the new developer tools, which are claimed to improve gameplay across the Android ecosystem. Alongside the earn-back program, Google Play Games on PC will also be generally available this year with major upgrades.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iP-Bzzn8q4s" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Google Play connects over two billion monthly active players worldwide. The new tools will help them engage these players across a wide range of devices, further driving engagement and revenue. Google is also hoping that since the gaming experiences are more immersive on PC, the company is trying to make bigger investments in the PC gaming platform.</p><p>After announcing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-games-on-pc-reaches-india">Google Play Games on PC</a>, which lets users play mobile games on PC, the search giant is expanding this support to native PC games. This means users will be able to enjoy native PC games on their Android phones.</p><p>Google now has a PC program, which includes a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that additionally provides powerful tools, including in-app purchase integration and advanced security protection.</p>
<p>The expansion also includes distribution through Play Console. It allows developers to manage their mobile and PC game builds in one place. It can further help simplify the process of packaging PC versions, configuring releases, and managing store listings. The earn-back program, as mentioned, will bring PC games to Google Play Games on PC, further unlocking up to 15% additional earnings.</p><p>Furthermore, Google is making all mobile games available on PC by default, and they can be opted out at any point. On the store, games will have a playability badge, which indicates the games’ compatibility with PC. Right beside the install button, users will also see “optimized” and “playable” options, which mean they offer a great gaming experience, and that games meet the minimum requirements to play well on PC, respectively. Google also assures that many games are already playable right out of the box.</p>

<p>The PC experience is also getting major upgrades, as gamers can now fully enjoy the Google Play Games on PC catalog on more devices, like AMD laptops and desktops. Google is also partnering with PC OEMs to make Google Play Games more accessible right from the start menu. Users will also be gaining new features like custom controls and a huge sidebar that allows quick adjustments. Additionally, multi-account and multi-instance support is also rolling out this month.</p>

<p>The Play Points experience is also promised to be more seamless on PC, as now they are easier to track and rewarding, including up to 10x points boosters on Google Play Games.  It allows players to earn and redeem points for in-game purchases and discounts.</p><p>Google asserts that at GDC, users will be able to enjoy complete gaming experiences on the best Android gaming devices and recommends that they meet at Moscone Center West Hall.</p>

<hr>
<p>At this year’s Game Developers Conference, Google rolled out a bunch of updates aimed at making games run better and keeping players more engaged across different platforms.</p><p>First up, Google has made Vulkan the go-to graphics API for Android. This move gives game developers the tools to tap into advanced rendering features like ray tracing and multithreading, paving the way for richer, more immersive visuals.</p><p>Games like Diablo Immortal are already putting Vulkan to work, while Pokémon TCG Pocket is seeing smoother performance across devices.</p><p>If your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-premium-android-games">favorite game</a> still runs on OpenGL, Google is introducing ANGLE, a system driver that translates OpenGL to Vulkan. More Android devices will rely on Vulkan moving forward, and major engines like Unity are making Vulkan integration even easier.</p><p>To help developers squeeze even more power from GPUs, Google is partnering with Samsung’s Austin Research Center to create an integrated GPU profiler for Vulkan. This tool, set for launch later this year, is designed to optimize graphics, memory, and AI-driven workloads.</p><p>Android’s Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) is also getting a boost to ensure longer gaming sessions without overheating. It does this by dynamically adjusting performance based on device temperature. It now has stronger support from chipmakers like MediaTek. MMORPGs like Lineage W are already using ADPF to optimize performance.</p>
<h2 id="pc-games-coming-to-mobile-2">PC games coming to mobile</h2>
<p>Additionally, Google Play Games is expanding its library, bringing PC-only games to mobile and making mobile titles easier to play on desktops. Expect to see DREDGE, TABS Mobile, and Disco Elysium hitting Google Play this year, all optimized for mobile gaming.</p><p>Google Play Games is also expanding its library with more titles, including Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, Sonic Rumble, and Odin: Valhalla Rising.  The full Google Play Games on PC catalog will be available on more devices, including AMD laptops and desktops.</p>

<p>Plus, Play Points now work on PC with up to 10x points boosters for in-game rewards.</p><p>Google Play Games is rolling out multi-account and multi-instance support, meaning you can run multiple accounts for the same game at once. On PC, new custom controls and an easy-access sidebar let you tweak settings mid-game.</p><p>Google Play Games on PC is moving into general availability later this year, so keep your eyes peeled for more multiplatform games and upgrades.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-nanometer-2">What is a nanometer?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1250px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uASsy7e38RJqyJhXrjy92e" name="micrometer-gauge" alt="A Starrett outside micrometer." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uASsy7e38RJqyJhXrjy92e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1250" height="703" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A nanometer (that's what the nm stands for) is a unit of metric measurement; 0.000000004 meters, to be precise. It's tiny, so tiny you can't see it without a microscope, and anything that small is extremely fragile, so a stiff breeze will break it.</p><p>When it comes to processors, the term nm refers to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/technology_node">node size of the chip</a>. A smaller number means smaller transistors are placed on the silicon bed. A 6nm chip uses 6nm transistors, while a 4nm chip uses 4nm transistors. But not really.</p><p>It's also a marketing term for processors. Yes, I'm telling you that a 4nm chip doesn't actually have 4nm parts on it; they <em>are</em> smaller parts than the previously labeled 6nm chips, though (which weren't actually 6nm, either). Here's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/1kQUXpZpLXI?si=2HitpcidW45Oq2jG">a video showing</a> that a 14nm chip from one vendor uses parts the same size as a 7nm chip from another vendor.</p><p>Basically, it's one of those things that only engineers will ever care about, but we're told to care about it anytime a chip maker refines its process to use smaller numbers. Should we?</p>

<h2 id="potential-benefits-of-a-smaller-node-2">Potential benefits of a smaller node</h2>
<p>There are two real, tangible benefits of a smaller process node: part density and energy efficiency.</p><p>You can fit more 4nm parts on a chip than you could 6nm. It's not a one-to-one calculation, so you're not actually getting 33% more transistors, but it will work out to a sizable number. That's because the advancement isn't just a numbers game, it's more like an evolution that can be combined with other advancements.</p><p>Transistors are the worker ants of a processor and do the calculations. It doesn't matter if those calculations are for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huawei-chip-is-the-heart-that-powers-deepseek-ai-claims-recent-leak">AI acceleration</a>, as part of a GPU, or just to tell when you tap a letter on your keyboard. If it requires any sort of processor activity (almost everything you do on your phone does), a series of transistors are doing that work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.51%;"><img id="mjVG3yYtzdAvTk3qFcQerc" name="snapdragon-8-gen-4-specs-leak.jpg" alt="Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 specs leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjVG3yYtzdAvTk3qFcQerc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In simple terms, more transistors can do more work. The process node advancement in other areas means the gains in performance can be significant. At least on paper, and we'll talk more about that in a minute.</p>
<p>Smaller transistors also use less power. Like part density, other improvements will compound these gains and matter as much or more than any actual power savings from a smaller part. It's important to remember that a by-the-numbers look means to see any actual improvements, 4nm transistors need to cumulatively use 34% less power than 6nm parts because there will be 33% more of them on a chip.</p><p>Again, it doesn't work like that in real life, so the "other advancements" bit makes more of a difference when it comes to new chips being more efficient than the previous models.</p><p>This is why "4nm" is more of a marketing term than an actual measurement. As with any industry, chip makers like to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-promises-accessible-flagships-with-new-4nm-dimensity-8200-chip">toot their own horn</a> about the process node size they have developed, but these numbers are mostly used because we can understand that 4nm is better than 6nm without knowing all of the details.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-actual-benefits-for-me-2">What about actual benefits for me?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kFEeRViMjS2gEsx3okvkzJ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-exclusive-samsung-colors" alt="The three Samsung.com exclusive Galaxy S25 Ultra colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kFEeRViMjS2gEsx3okvkzJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The benefits of a smaller process are there even though we won't notice them.</p><p>Yes, this goes against almost everything you'll read telling why 3nm or 4nm is so great and such a breakthrough, but it's the truth. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't care about it, but you should understand that this improvement is just part of the overall advancement of the modern processor and isn't something you'll ever notice on its own.</p><p>This is because there is a limit to any benefit of shrinking down circuits, and we're very close to it. If chip makers only focused on building smaller transistors and circuits, they would spend billions to offer products that are no better than previous generations.</p><p>Even with all the other chip advancements, we barely notice a difference in a yearly chip upgrade, and those advancements can be much more dramatic than just shrinking the process node. Chip makers have to tell you that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">the latest offering</a> has the potential for 12% better performance and 30% better battery life because you'll never notice it if they don't tell you to look for it.</p><p>The latest chip from Apple or Qualcomm isn't great because it has smaller transistors, but it's great because of all of the other "stuff" engineers are doing to improve performance and power efficiency. One day, we'll see another breakthrough, but unless you compare a 4nm chip to something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-edge-s-could-be-first-phone-mysterious-new-snapdragon-800-series-chipset">28nm chip</a>, size doesn't really matter much.</p>

<p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">reviewed the Phone 2a</a> last year, I called it the best budget phone of the year. In 2025, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a Pro</a> is carrying that mantle. Nothing's latest phone retains a similar foundation as its predecessor, so you get an interesting design at the back, clean software with useful extras, good customizability, timely software updates, and great cameras. <br><br>Interestingly, the 3a Pro gets a 50MP telephoto lens, giving it a distinct advantage over the 2a. Nothing switched over to Qualcomm silicon once again, and that's a good thing — the phone has much better performance in gaming and daily use versus the 2a and 2a Plus. <br><br>I used the Phone 3a Pro for just over a week now, and I'm convinced that this is the only budget phone worth buying in India. I like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review">POCO X7 Pro</a> as well, but the software on that device isn't anywhere as good, and it doesn't quite have the same design flair.</p>
<h2 id="a-design-that-shines-literally-2">A design that shines — literally </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro with LED lights enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Phone 3a Pro's design is divisive — Nothing admitted as much during the briefing. The phone still has a unique see-through pattern at the back, but the camera island has a rounded design and is significantly bigger than last year. <br><br>That's down to the inclusion of the new tele lens, and while there are detractors to the design, I like it; the industrial design makes the phone stand out, and while the camera island could have looked better, it is quirky — and I enjoy that in a phone. The camera island juts out considerably, but because it's stretched across nearly the entire width at the back, there isn't any wobble when using the Phone 3a Pro on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mNFgGHHBctwRRfRAmW8eSC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro next to Phone 3a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mNFgGHHBctwRRfRAmW8eSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing went with a glass back this time, noting that while the plastic back on the Phone 2a made the device lighter, it was prone to scratching. Nothing says its userbase wanted a glass back, so it catered to that demand. The glass is protected by a custom solution, and it is effective against tumbles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Wvxf6GPuTu2uXSyy5QrNPC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro back view against red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wvxf6GPuTu2uXSyy5QrNPC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, the Phone 3a Pro looks much better in real life than the product renders would suggest, so if you're unsure about the device solely based on the design, I'd recommend going to a store and trying it out; Nothing sells the device via select big brand retail stores in India.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7WYmBpFe2GpkY2EhgSTeXC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro back view against red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WYmBpFe2GpkY2EhgSTeXC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the LEDs at the back continue to be a major differentiator, and I like how this feature has evolved over the last two years. The three lighting zones don't cover much area — unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> — but they're just as customizable. I'm using the grey color variant of the device, and while it isn't quite as striking as the blue model, it does a brilliant job accentuating the design.</p>

<p>What I like about the Phone 3a Pro is that it has an aluminum mid-frame with matte sides. This makes holding and using the phone that much easier, and it creates a much better in-hand feel. I'm still not a fan of the flat sides though, but Nothing is at least consistent in this regard. The phone has IP64 ingress protection, and Nothing says while it didn't get the Phone 3a Pro tested for IP65 or IP67, it should weather immersion in water — but without a rating, you lose any warranty due to water damage if you try.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-hardware-you-need-2">All the hardware you need</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6gd4UfQYqtfMNMfTeYpHWC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro home page with custom icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6gd4UfQYqtfMNMfTeYpHWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Phone 3a Pro has a 6.77-inch AMOLED panel, and just like its predecessor, it has ultra-thin bezels on all sides. This is a minor point, but it is yet another area where Nothing's attention to detail makes the device stand out, and it's good to see the brand providing the same quality on its budget phones as its flagship.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4w3ztfnMGerqZeQQaFj4zC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4w3ztfnMGerqZeQQaFj4zC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, the panel has good colors and contrast, and the notable change this year is that it gets much brighter than the Phone 2a — this was immediately evident when using the device outdoors. I didn't see any issues while gaming or streaming media, and although the Phone 3a Pro doesn't quite have the same level of performance as a high-end device, it holds up incredibly well considering it's a budget phone. Thermals are handled much better, and it makes a noticeable difference in extended gaming sessions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9AYbG7cLnqx3bHpKniDrsC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9AYbG7cLnqx3bHpKniDrsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the hardware is pretty standard; there's good connectivity, a decent vibration motor, and thanks to a 5000mAh battery, the phone lasts a day without any issues at all. The 50W charging tech means it takes just an hour to charge the Phone 3a Pro, and while it's annoying that you still don't get a charger in the box, it relies on the USB PD protocol, so you can use any charger with the device.</p>

<p>I enjoyed using the cameras on the Phone 2a last year, and this is an area where the Phone 3a Pro brings considerable upgrades. The 50MP Samsung GNJ main camera takes better images in low-light situations, and the new 50MP Sony LYT-600 tele lens is fantastic; it takes clear shots at 3x, and you get usable shots at up to 10x. Annoyingly, video is limited to 4K30, and you don't get 4K60 recording on the device. Video recording itself is pretty average, but that's the case with most budget devices.</p>
<h2 id="essential-software-2">Essential software</h2>

<p>A big part of the allure with Nothing's phones is the software. There just aren't enough budget phones with clean software, so Nothing's focus in this area is refreshing. The interface continues to be just as clean as previous years, and Nothing OS 3.1 has plenty of customizability. Nothing has a slate of exclusive widgets on its devices, and they combine great design with usability.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based interface is fluid, and I enjoy using it quite a bit. While it isn't what I'd call vanilla Android, there's a distinct visual style, and unlike most other skins, the design doesn't feel cumbersome in the least. It's just enjoyable to use, and Nothing OS 3.1 continues to me one of my favorite Android interfaces.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RM78fHrvqgYTTZZWExpRUC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro software showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RM78fHrvqgYTTZZWExpRUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An interesting addition this year is a button underneath the power button. This is to invoke Essential Space, a shelf that organizes all your screenshots, to-do lists, notes, voice memos, images, and more. A single press of the button lets you jot down a note, a long press lets you dictate a voice memo, and a double press launches the shelf. It is one of the best features on the Phone 3a Pro, and while it's still in its infancy — Nothing has ambitious plans for the feature — it's clear that it has great potential.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w4kWfeWPMQeppDvSbUNbSC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro software showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w4kWfeWPMQeppDvSbUNbSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing says Essential Space will be a differentiator on the Phone 3 that's slated to launch sometime later this year, but it didn't want to limit the mode to its flagship, so its debuting on the Phone 3a and 3a Pro. That's great to see, and honestly, it makes me question why other Android brands didn't come up with something similar until now.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-comes-close-2">Nothing comes close</h2>

<p>The Phone 3a Pro costs ₹30,999 ($356) in India for the 8GB/128GB edition, and I know calling it a budget phone is dubious, but that's where the industry is headed. Phone prices are steadily on the rise, and decent budget phones cost nearly double what they used to just a few years ago. <br><br>That said, these phones have better hardware, elegant designs, and significantly better cameras. The Phone 3a Pro in particular proves that budget phones can be cool too, and the combination of unique design, clean software, and great cameras at the back make it the best choice in this category. There isn't another device that gives you quite as many features, and it's no wonder that Nothing is aggressively advertising the Phone 3a Pro in India — it knows it's onto something great.</p>

Since the phone runs Android 15 (with OxygenOS 15 overlay) out of the box, you can expect it to be <strong>updated to Android versions 16 through 19</strong>. After the last OS update, the OnePlus 13 will <strong>continue to get security patches for two more years</strong>.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="the-oneplus-13-s-update-policy-is-good-but-it-could-and-should-be-better-2">The OnePlus 13's update policy is good, but it could (and should) be better</h2>
<p>It probably won't be an exaggeration to say that the OnePlus 13 is the best phone that the company has ever made. Building further upon the foundation laid by its already-excellent predecessor, OnePlus's newest top-of-the-line smartphone manages to get just about everything right. It's no wonder the OnePlus 13 earned a perfect score from Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich when he <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">reviewed</a> the phone.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 comes with a refreshed design that's a visual delight. Not just that, the "2.5D" curved edges of the front and back panels make it quite comfortable to hold as well. You have a choice of two materials (vegan leather and textured glass) for the rear and both look equally gorgeous. Oh, and you also have an IP69 certification, which is a first for any smartphone. Combined with that premium build quality and top-tier specs (as you'd expect), it's clear that the OnePlus 13 is a smartphone designed to last.</p><p>But even though the phone's hardware—both on the inside and the outside—is ready for the long haul, what about the software?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-05" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 runs Android 15 (with the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">Oxygen OS 15</a> overlay) out of the box, and OnePlus has committed to providing it four years of major OS updates. This means that it's on track to receive Android 16, 17, 18, and 19 in future. Once that's done, the phone will get security patches for two extra years. It's also worth mentioning that the exact same update policy applies to the OnePlus 13R too.</p><p>Now, this software update commitment doesn't sound all that bad, until you realize it doesn't come close to the seven years of major OS updates that Samsung and Google promise for their flagship smartphones. It probably would be alright if this was a mid-range smartphone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">OnePlus Nord 4</a> (which by the way, also benefits from the same update commitment), but it's not. The OnePlus 13 is a full-blown flagship having a starting price of $900, so we think it deserves more in terms of software support.</p><p>What's also worth noting is that the OnePlus 13 is fully capable of going much further as far as updates are concerned, since this thing is crammed with blazing-fast hardware. We're talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, helped by up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. You get a fabulous triple-lens rear camera setup, a 6,000mAh battery with incredible charging speeds, and much more. Sure, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-president-throws-shade-at-seven-years-of-updates">might think</a> a long software update commitment doesn't make sense, but it actually does, even more so when you're expected to shell out nearly a grand for a flagship.</p><p>When all is said and done, the OnePlus 13 is hands down one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> you can get in the market at this time. It ticks all the right boxes and is a phone we can recommend to anyone looking for a full-featured flagship. However, a longer update commitment would make the OnePlus 13 an even more astounding value buy than it already is.</p>

<p>As a smartphone startup in the 2020s, Nothing is trying to do the impossible by shaking up a huge established market, and it's starting with the midrange sector. Nothing's Phone 2a set the standard for what a midrange phone should be, and now the company is improving on that standard with the latest Nothing Phone 3a. It's only slightly more expensive than its predecessor, but offers a more complete package.</p><p>Neither phone is fully equipped for use in the U.S., as carrier support is limited and they are only sold via the Nothing Beta Program. However, both devices are ideal for regions like Europe and India. Starting at £329 or ₹24,999, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a> offers an excellent value proposition. But how does it compare to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>? That's what we're going to find out in this comparison.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-vs-nothing-phone-2a-design-and-display-2">Nothing Phone 3a vs. Nothing Phone 2a: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fv6mCkNhot9tpMDPii42Za" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-3" alt="Photos of the Nothing Phone 3a series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fv6mCkNhot9tpMDPii42Za.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Nothing Phone 3a and Phone 2a have a striking design, and they look quite similar. The two smartphones have a "camera island" with rear sensors positioned in the top center of their back. Of course, the Phone 3a's bigger lenses and triple camera system make that camera island look gigantic compared to that of the dual-camera Phone 2a.</p><p>The newer model is slightly larger than its predecessor, with the Phone 3a packing a 6.77-inch screen and the Phone 2a featuring a 6.7-inch display. They use similar display technologies, with support for 120Hz refresh rates and an OLED panel. However, the Phone 3a has an LTPO screen, which will result in smoother animations. Both phones support HDR10+ and have a peak brightness rating of 1,300 nits.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The bigger and better theme of the Phone 3a makes it physically larger than the Phone 2a. It measures 163.52 x 77.5 x 8.35mm and weighs 201 grams, whereas the Phone 2a measures 161.7 x 76.3 x 8.6mm and weighs 190 grams. Like most 6.7-inch phones, the Phone 3a's size can feel like a burden at times, and you'll feel the weight. Overall, it's pretty similar to the Phone 2a in that regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="objApTBuN3vo47FqWGC2Ra" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-1" alt="Photos of the Nothing Phone 3a series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/objApTBuN3vo47FqWGC2Ra.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing also improved the durability of the Phone 3a, supporting IP64 for dust and water resistance. Oddly, the company switched from Gorilla Glass this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">using Panda Glass on the Phone 3a</a>. The important part is that Panda Glass is hardened, so it ideally won't crack easily, but some reports indicate Panda is easier to scratch than Gorilla.</p><p>By comparison, the Nothing Phone 2a features an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance, and Gorilla Glass 5.</p>

<p>Nothing made a big deal out of its switch from MediaTek to Qualcomm for its budget phones this year. The Nothing Phone 3a uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a>, a budget chip recently optimized to improve AI performance. However, in benchmarks and real-world tests, we found that the Phone 3a is worse than the Phone 2a in gaming and graphics performance.</p><p>The MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset in the Nothing Phone 2a seems to perform better in graphics tasks, while falling to the Phone 3a in CPU-based tasks. In our review, our own Nicholas Sutrich found that there was a 30-40% drop in benchmark FPS on the Phone 3a compared to the Phone 2a. This was reflected in real-world tests, too, even affecting relatively light games like Minecraft.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.77%;"><img id="9yrBEFUbpZbEiQpCsCoKbn" name="nothing-phone-2a-vs-nothing-phone-3a-minecraft-gaming-performance" alt="Comparing game performance in Minecraft between the Nothing Phone 3a/3a Pro and the Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9yrBEFUbpZbEiQpCsCoKbn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With that being said, both phones performed great in daily use. They can each be configured with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, but some configurations are only available in certain regions. In terms of battery, both phones have a 5,000mAh capacity. The Nothing Phone 3a charges slightly faster, with 50W support compared to the Phone 2a's 45W support.</p>

<p>With the Phone 3a, Nothing is promising three full OS upgrades and six total years of security patches. It's starting with Nothing OS 3.1, which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and includes all the latest AI features from Nothing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">including the Essential Space</a>. Although the Phone 2a got the Nothing OS 3 update, it won't get all the new AI features. Its last platform update will be Android 17, so it still has plenty of support left.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UKRGdfGSJsqZGb2ePj9GoD" name="nothing-phone-3a-camera" alt="The camera viewfinder on the Nothing Phone (3a)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UKRGdfGSJsqZGb2ePj9GoD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the first time, Nothing is offering a telephoto lens on the Nothing Phone 3a. For the regular Phone 3a, the 50MP f/2.0 Samsung telephoto camera only does 2x optical zoom, but it's better than nothing. The main camera is a 50MP f/1.88 Samsung sensor with a 1/1.57-inch sensor size, and it includes optical image stabilization. The third camera is an 8MP, f/2.2 Sony ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view.</p><p>Even without support for a high level of optical zoom, the telephoto lens in the Nothing Phone 3a helps it produce better zoom shots than its predecessor, as you can see in the image samples below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9216px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.33%;"><img id="ra3iqjqy2vG5A5vsU65GEC" name="nothing-phone-2a-vs-phone-3a-vs-phone-3a-pro-camera-comparison-6x-01" alt="Comparing camera quality between the Nothing Phone 2a, Phone 3a, and Phone 3a Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ra3iqjqy2vG5A5vsU65GEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="9216" height="4731" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone 2a has a 50MP, f/1.9 Samsung GN9 main sensor that's very similar to the one on the Phone 3a. Notably, it still supports OIS and 4K30 video recording. That's paired with a 50MP, f/2.2 Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens with an 84.5-degree field of view.</p><p>On the front, both phones feature 32MP, f/2.2 cameras — more than good enough to snap all the selfies you need.</p>

<p>If you're in the market for a budget Android phone, the Nothing Phone 3a makes a compelling case. It's better than the cheapest Samsung Galaxy A series phones, and it's cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> — and the rumored Pixel 9a, for that matter. Due to the Nothing Phone 2a's limited availability, you won't find much of a discount on last-generation hardware. That's why the Phone 3a is our pick if you had to choose between it and the Phone 2a.</p><p>With that being said, the Phone 2a is still a worthy pick for a daily driver in 2025. The Phone 2a is still fast and runs the latest OS — it's even faster than the Phone 3a in graphics performance. For the Nothing Phone 2a owners out there, an upgrade to the Phone 3a isn't necessary.</p>

<ul><li>Fitbit seems to have filed another patent for measuring blood pressure on a future wearable.</li><li>Fitbit's previous patent to measure the same metric was rejected previously, and it looks like the company hasn't given up.</li><li>The company wants to achieve a non-invasive way to measure blood pressure, which it could achieve if the said wearable would carry both pressure and optical sensors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Fitbit is working on a non-invasive way to track people's blood pressure with a future wearable.</p><p>The latest patent (patent no. 12,239,424 B2) submitted by the company revealed plans for a wearable being loaded with biometric sensors that could track changes in blood flow and artery stiffness (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/03/09/fitbit-patent-blood-pressure/" target="_blank">as first spotted by Gadgets and Wearables</a>).</p><p>Generally, blood pressure is monitored using a cuff-like device that tightens to detect the flow of blood and then releases the grip to give the user their readings. To be able to achieve it on a fitness-tracking wearable seems like reaching for the moon.</p><p>However, the publication adds that Fitbit goes into the weeds about this possible feature. The patent states that the device will have a mix of pressure sensors and optical sensors embedded within the wearable which could either be a smartwatch or a smart ring. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbits-smart-ring-patent-is-just-the-beginning">previous rumors indicate</a> that the company could be working on a smart ring that would be built to track blood pressure, glucose, lipids, hemoglobin, and your diet, along with other fitness metrics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HUkPJK6ab623odkDc7oxcA" name="Fitbit-ring-patent" alt="Diagram showing Fitbit-Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HUkPJK6ab623odkDc7oxcA.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: U.S. Patent Office)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This leads us to believe that the recent patent could be talking about the smart ring as well. Ideally, the wearable should have either a band or sensors that could track fluctuations in blood flow or artery stiffness.</p><p>"The filing describes a system where sensors press against the skin and detect small mechanical changes caused by blood moving through the arteries," the publication added. This would have to work in tandem with the usual PPG sensors that smartwatches have that use light to measure blood flow and pressure. The wearable would combine both readings to provide an accurate blood pressure metric.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UZg66ehc4tTxHXDNTifnhD" name="Fitbit-Sense-2-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Fitbit Sense 2 on the wrist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UZg66ehc4tTxHXDNTifnhD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fitbit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But how would a wearable such as a smartwatch or ring achieve the tightening of a traditional BP machine, you ask? The patent answers that, too. It says that "Fitbit’s wearable could use inflatable or mechanically controlled elements to apply pressure to the skin on a much smaller scale." This makes it a bit less likely that it could be a smart ring.</p><p>Still, this isn't the first time that Fitbit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US390993028&_cid=P21-LDSXWU-06214-1">has filed such a patent<em>.</em> </a>In 2023, we saw something similar, where an FDA-approved watch band would turn into an inflatable one to measure blood pressure, as seen below. However, that didn't show up on the subsequent Fitbit watches.</p>

<p>Patents are filed by companies all the time for out-of-the-box features, but that doesn't mean it would show up on the actual device. However, if it does show up on the wearable, it would have an upper hand over other competitors on the market.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is pushing an update for its demo-focused app that might generate some hype around its major Android update.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/try-galaxy-app-simulates-one-ui-7-s25-series/">SamMobile</a> highlights a recent update to the Try Galaxy app that lets users on past-gen Galaxy devices, and other Android phones, demo One UI 7's features. The app's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://trygalaxy.com/">official page</a> reflects its recent update of Samsung's upcoming Android 15-based update. For what to expect, Try Galaxy will simulate some of the newest core systems on your device, like the Now Brief.</p><p>The publication's test details a the Now Brief widget is available in this app's demo for your home screen. The small, pill-shaped widget displays some quick information externally before expanding fully once tapped. This experience is exactly what you'd see on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>. Users tapping the widget will receive a simulated briefing packed with weather information, your "schedule," and more.</p><p>The playtest also gives users a taste of Samsung's quick panel overhaul. The Quick Settings panel and your notifications panel are now separate in One uI 7. This was something the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">teased during SDC 2024</a> before it debuted on the latest flagship trio.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.90%;"><img id="ea9FbefoXEsevd7fnGAgP3" name="samsung-try-galaxy-one-ui-7-app-update" alt="Samsung has updated its Try Galaxy app with a simulation of One UI 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ea9FbefoXEsevd7fnGAgP3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1192" height="571" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The One UI 7 simulation also features some smaller software pieces like Samsung's complete icon rework. Galaxy's upcoming app drawer redesign is also included in the Try Galaxy demo, per the publication. Users can head to the official website, scan the QR code, and begin downloading the simulation on Android and iOS.</p><p>Funnily enough, Samsung's Try Galaxy app was previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-try-galaxy-app-update">only available for Apple's iPhones</a> as a way to, well, get them to switch. The app would simulate the Android experience on its recent smartphones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-try-galaxy-app-foldable-features-update">even its foldables</a>.</p><p>However, the company finally brought its Try Galaxy app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-try-galaxy-android-galaxy-ai-demo">to Android users</a>. The move was made as Samsung stepped into its "era of mobile AI." Many of the core Galaxy AI features were present during that test, as well as the company's One UI 6.1 update for interested users. The Galaxy AI playtest let users experiment with Live Translate, Note Assist, and Chat Assist among others.</p><p>As if we needed to be more ready for One UI 7, this Try Galaxy update is rolling out (perhaps) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">a month before</a> the software goes live. Samsung recently confirmed that, after a series of critical delays, One UI 7 should launch for eligible Galaxy devices in April. Meanwhile, it just started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">its first beta program</a> for the Flip 6 and Fold 6.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted issues users have reported with media texts for RCS chats in Messages.</li><li>The company is rolling out a few updates for Messages that should solve media reception "slowdowns" and "failures" that users have recently reported.</li><li>Google recently brought enhanced scam detection measures to Messages and the Phone app in its March feature drop for Pixels.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users should soon find relief for a recent string of issues plaguing RCS texts in the Messages app.</p><p>In a recent Google Messages <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/thread/330404133?hl=en">community post</a>, the company highlighted that it has started addressing instances of failed media texts in RCS chats (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/google-messages-media-receiving/">9to5Google</a>). The community manager states Google's team has been "actively working" toward a fix and several updates are being rolled out to (hopefully) solve the problem. Google is specifically targeting "receiving performance."</p><p>Aside from text failures, Google is also looking at tackling media text "slowdowns," which should help your device download media (image/videos) at a more acceptable speed. The thread states that these updates should provide a "noticeable difference;" however, the current wave of patches might not solve everything.</p><p>Google notes how complex these issues are and users who are still experiencing problems should let them know.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q5z7wdpDeFQNn6hVd5hTpH" name="pixel-google-messages-oops.jpg" alt="Pixel Google Messages Oops" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q5z7wdpDeFQNn6hVd5hTpH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's speculation that the updates Google is rolling out are server-side improvements — which would make sense. However, keep your eyes peeled in case something more substantial arrives via a Play Store update.</p><p>The media issues are a sore spot on an otherwise useful Google Messages update that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">dropped at the beginning</a> of March. The company recently rolled out its feature drop for Pixels, which brought enhanced scam protection measures to the Messages and Phone app. Each app leverages Google's AI to automatically detect and flag potential malicious users. For texts, the AI will scan messages for "commonly associated with scams" and alert you to them within the thread.</p><p>Users can quickly report and block that user without a second thought to protect your data.</p><p>Meanwhile, we're still awaiting Google's promised <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-announces-911-rcs-texting-to-android">911 RCS texting</a> capabilities with authorities. The company first teased this feature last summer, stating users could text emergency services and send them videos/images to help the location efforts. While this was planned for "the winter," we might be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-911-rcs-support-nearly-ready-detailed">much closer to it</a> than we think.</p>

In other words, you could get an excellent AI-powered smartphone and 12 months of great wireless for just $579.

<p>The new <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is huge, powerful, and unfortunately, quite expensive, which is why we're excited to see Mint Mobile carve $200 off the phone when you bundle the purchase with one year of the Unlimited plan.

<p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/328790190/google-pixel-watch-update-march-2025?hl=en">Wear OS 5.1 community post</a> only scratches the surface of the new features it brings to Pixel Watches. But since I'm <em>still</em> waiting one week later for my Pixel Watch 3 LTE to receive the update, I'm pivoting from my planned hands-on to focus on one small but important note that you probably missed: Google is switching to quarterly Wear OS updates, and it's probably for the best.</p><p>We knew that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5#section-wear-os-5-1">Wear OS 5.1</a> would add backend improvements like a credentials manager API and a watch-speaker option for apps so they can read out fitness instructions or sound an alarm without earbuds. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">Loss of Pulse</a> is coming soon, but that's somewhat unrelated to 5.1.</p><p>The community post changelog is fairly short, with an improved step count algorithm in specific cases like pushing a shopping cart, stroller, or wheelchair; easier menstrual health logging in Fitbit; and auto-bedtime mode on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> (though not the original Watch yet). You also get a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel-watch/2025/2025-03-01">key high and moderate security patches</a>.</p><p>Beyond these, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/05/wear-os-5-1-new-features/">9to5Google</a> has logged other changes spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> owners, like a developer option to "Force Global AOD" on apps, a new accent color for the UI, and a new Modes menu consolidating DND, Bedtime, and Theater in one place.</p><p>In other words, it's a subtly significant set of updates, which may explain why we've been stuck on the November update for so long. And Google wants us to get used to waiting: the community post states that "our next planned update will target June 2025, and <strong>quarterly thereafter</strong>" (emphasis mine).</p>

<p>Google had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">roll back Wear OS 5</a> on older Pixel Watches in September — taking about six weeks to fix it — and hasn't released a new patch since November 2024. Even then, the company was starting to shift its update strategy with the Pixel Watch, announcing that the next update wouldn't arrive until four months later, in March 2025.</p><p>It's a noticeable change from the last couple of years, and this new quarterly pivot seems to suggest that Google has decided monthly updates aren't necessary anymore.</p><p>Since the first Pixel Watch launched in October 2022, Google has updated Pixel Watches to match the monthly Pixel updates. So, I checked all 24 Pixel Watch update community posts from November 2022 onward to see how many made <em>significant</em> feature changes.</p><p>Google made small Fitbit app changes in November 2022 and bug fixes in December. In 2023, nine out of the 12 monthly updates only had security fixes and/or bug fixes (mostly security). Outside of Wear OS 4 in October 2023, only one update (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-march-2023-update">March 2023</a>) added significant new features. Essentially, not much changed between versions.</p><p>In 2024, five out of the ten updates focused solely on security. Google was a little more ambitious with new Google Maps and Fitbit features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-march-2024-update">March 2024</a>, improved haptics and auto-brightness in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-april-2024-update-rollout">April 2024</a>, and better crash/ fall detection and on-wrist detection in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-june-2024-update">June 2024</a>. However, most of these coincided with broader Pixel feature drops. Both September and November 2024 focused on Wear OS 5, but November was a last-gen do-over with no new Watch 3 features.</p><p>With this new quarterly schedule, we can expect new feature drops in June, September, and December 2025. I can't say for certain why Google has chosen this option, but I'm fairly confident that this could be a good thing for Pixel Watch owners — if Google handles them well.</p>

<p>It's a bit unfortunate that Pixel Watch owners accustomed to monthly security patches will now have to wait three months between hotfixes. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/wear">Wear OS security bulletins</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel-watch">Pixel Watch security bulletins</a> only ever have a couple of issues to resolve per month, compared to the dozens per month you see on Android phones. Some months, there aren't any significant fixes at all, and very few are ever "critical."</p><p>The point is that I don't necessarily see an urgent need for monthly patches simply for the sake of aligning their updates with Pixel phones. Instead of focusing on making stable, consistent changes every month, it seems more productive to me if they make four <em>substantial</em> changes per year.</p><p>We now know that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> should arrive in September 2025 after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> launch. Allegedly, Gemini will replace Google Assistant as the default assistant, which is a fairly significant change. So I'd rather Google's team have three months to prepare for this update than waste time on trivial updates in the interim.</p>

<p>I also think Google should consider offering beta Wear OS testing on the Pixel Watch, as Samsung does with One UI Watch, as a way to root out issues ahead of time. Having preset quarterly updates will give its engineers more buffer time to catch them and avoid another frustrating rollback, too.</p><p>Basically, I'm looking for the silver lining in what many Pixel Watch owners might consider bad news. Whether the next June 2025 update is called "Wear OS 5.2" or not, it should be more substantial than the typical, perfunctory updates we used to get. And I assume my monthly Pixel phone patches will catch the bulk of any security vulnerabilities.</p><p>But if Google can't live up to its quarterly schedule or still releases buggy updates, then that'll certainly be a bad sign. We'll see what the rest of 2025 brings for Pixel Watch owners!</p>

<ul><li>Reports claim Samsung is moving into the mass production stage of its new fourth-generation 4nm chips, codename "SF4X."</li><li>Sources claim the company has created its most "advanced" 4nm chip with a strong focus on AI for various companies globally.</li><li>Other Samsung chip rumors speculate about its Exynos 2600 SoC, which could find its way into the Galaxy S26.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reports claim Samsung is kickstarting its development plan for a new generation of chips to propel its Foundry business.</p><p>Claims that Samsung has started mass producing its next-gen 4nm process chips stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20250311174600">ZDNet Korea</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-starts-mass-production-fourth-generation-4nm-chips/">SamMobile</a>). According to the publication's sources, the process, known as "SF4X," is viewed by Samsung as a "key weapon" for its Foundry business. The Korean OEM is reportedly looking to gain ground in the SoC manufactuering business after falling behind the likes of TSMC.</p><p>What's more, AI seems to be at the core of Samsung's next 4nm process iteration. An alleged "insider" informed the publication the company's new node is its "most advanced."</p><p>Since the node's first production run in 2021, the SF4X has supposedly improved its subsequent writing process, as well as introducing high-speed transistors. Samsung is also looking to support next-gen "packaging technologies" via 2.5D and 3D. Samsung has reportedly "stabilized" the rumored 4nm process chip's yield, meaning its production <em>should </em>be decent.</p><p>The company is said to be in good spirits about this, considering it has "failed to secure major customers" like Qualcomm and Apple, per reports. Samsung is reportedly interested in selling its 4nm chip to companies "around the world." The post adds Samsung has an ongoing contract with X for its AI Grok for its 4nm process chip.</p>

<p>While Samsung first started producing 4nm chips in 2021, it wasn't until 2022 when the product <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s22s-4nm-chip-isnt-noticeably-faster-it-wins-other-areas">became mainstream</a> — and plugged into the Galaxy S22. However, during Android Central's original overview of the chip, it didn't provide a noteworthy boost to the phone that you'd write home about. A slight performance boost was noted, thanks to Samsung's 4nm SoC, but its impact wasn't profound in day-to-day usage.</p><p>Some of the primary strengths were in the imaging department when taking photos. Jump to the present day and we're seeing rumors of more AI focus and application for companies with large AI models instead of handheld devices.</p><p>On the other hand, we have rumors that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2600-chip-urgent-push-reported">is pushing forward</a> with its next 2nm process chip, the Exynos 2600. The company is reportedly expressing "urgency" behind the production of this new chip and has even created a "performance improvement task force" to address concerns.</p><p>Not only does Samsung want to ensure the Exynos 2600 is stable, but it also wants to secure performance competitiveness when standing against others in the industry. Rumors suggest this chip could find its way into the Galaxy S26 series next year.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's Project Moohan XR Headset has been the talk of the town lately after it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-to-give-us-a-closer-look-at-android-xr-headset">showcased more vividly</a> at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC 2025</a> in Barcelona.</p><p>When Samsung first showed off only the headset at Unpacked, it also confirmed that it would come with full support for hand tracking and eye tracking, as well as motion-based controllers. However, while the company plans on launching it sometime this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-xr-headset-controllers-model-number/">SamMobile</a> seems to have spotted references to what appears to be first-party controllers for the headset.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to the publication, Samsung appears to be making first-party motion controllers for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>. They even seemed to have spotted a model number for them: <strong>ET-OI610</strong>.</p><p>That will help with motion sensing for those who use the headset for mixed-reality gaming, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>. That said, the device is built to come with eye and hand tracking as well.</p><p>What we don't know yet is if these controllers will come coupled with the XR headset. If not, Samsung is likely to put an additional price tag on these controllers, much like the Apple Vision Pro. However, if Samsung wants to one-up Apple, it should bundle these controllers with the headset like the other competitors.</p><p>If they do sell it as a separate accessory, it would only mean that the headset would work fine without controllers, only based on other motion gestures. That said, so far, we know that Samsung's XR headset will be powered by Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</a>. The headset is said to come with pancake lenses that deliver a high-resolution, clear XR experience.</p><p>Google also hinted that the XR headset could be powered by Gemini for multimodal communication. The tech giant said, "You can talk to your device as if you were talking to someone in the physical world."</p><p>Samsung's XR headset could be priced at around $1,500 or less, according to our Wearables lead Michael Hicks. It remains to be seen when Samsung will finally reveal all the specs of Project Moohan, although we're hoping it will come through at the next Unpacked event, which may happen this summer.</p>

<ul><li>Telegram’s latest update includes the ability to cast videos on Chromecast-supported devices.</li><li>The other new features give content creators and public figures more control over their privacy and monetize their popularity.</li><li>They can filter out unwanted messages and put a fee for people who message them outside their contacts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Telegram has announced a bunch of new features for the messaging platform, including the ability to cast videos to TVs for Android phone users.</p><p>According to the latest<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://telegram.org/blog/star-messages-gateway-2-0-and-more"> blog post</a>, shared videos on Telegram can be viewed on TVs as the messaging platform gains support for Chromecast devices. It could likely work with smart TVs that already support Chromecast sharing.</p>
<p>“Android users can now cast videos straight to their Chromecast devices — whether you're watching memes with friends or presenting important content in a meeting, enjoy it all on the big screen!”</p><p>Casting a video also appears hassle-free as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> users need to open a video on the Telegram app, select the Settings icon on the top right, and look for the Chromecast option. It is pretty similar to what we are used to on other streaming apps like YouTube or Netflix, for instance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:942px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.69%;"><img id="dBPTzpS2TSgGM3frYx9EyN" name="Telegram-video-Chromecast" alt="Telegram video chromecast feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBPTzpS2TSgGM3frYx9EyN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="942" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the ability to cast videos, other features of the messaging platform are tailored for content creators and public figures. They are privacy-focused and also offer new ways to monetize their popularity.</p><p>As prominent figures receive numerous messages daily, they can now set a fee for incoming messages from people who are not on their contacts list. It further allows them to earn Stars as well. Additionally, they can filter out unwanted messages, and strangers can contact them only when they are willing to share Stars.</p><p>Telegram says these new features can be applied to group chats and channel discussions as it lets interactions stay focused and free from spam.</p><p>Furthermore, when someone tries to contact a user for the first time, Telegram will provide a new detailed info page that showcases information like country, shared groups, their Telegram joining date, and other such essential details, which further help in tackling spam and avoid impersonators.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="mT9Wqx7ZBqZJGaCyXHnygB" name="Telegram-Gateway-authentication" alt="Telegram Gateway Authentication" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mT9Wqx7ZBqZJGaCyXHnygB.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Telegram Gateway is a cost-effective and privacy-focused solution from the messaging platform that offers user authentication. It allows users to verify their customers’ phone numbers through Telegram. The aim is to replace standard SMS verification, and it “elsewhere can cost $0.50 or more per message, while Telegram Gateway offers authentication for just $0.01.”</p>

We've reached a point where just about every launch event is accompanied by a promo video that's been recorded using whatever phone is being announced.</p><p>This continued with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> despite the only change being an upgraded 50MP ultrawide lens. It also marks the third year that Samsung has relied on the 200MP ISOCELL HP2 as its primary lens. Even still, Samsung's flagship devices are regularly touted as being among the best for mobile photography.</p><p>So, with that in mind, we decided to put those claims to the test against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. I also included the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> just to see whether it's really worth upgrading, purely for the cameras.</p><p>Before diving in, I want to assure you that all of the pictures you see were taken with the default settings. The images were not manipulated in any way, as to provide as balanced of a comparison as possible.</p>

<p>Kicking things off, I compared the two phones that will likely dominate the market in 2025: the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The first picture in the gallery makes use of the ultrawide lens from both devices, with the iPhone definitely having a warmer tone.</p><p>Besides that, the pictures look fairly similar, capturing the same amount of detail. I have to admit that it was pretty darn cool being able to see the S25 Ultra manage to capture the bird as it was flying in front of me in the top right corner.</p><p>In the picture of the birds mostly chilling on the dock, the S25 Ultra again produced a "cooler" image than the iPhone. However, the iPhone's picture is a bit brighter, making it a bit easier to notice a few more details. That being said, there's nothing quite like capturing a bird as it takes off, and it was pure luck that I was able to get this image from the Ultra.</p><p>If you can't tell, there's a recurring theme with these phones, with the iPhone producing warmer tones, even if just slightly. Such is the case with the pictures in front of Tudor Hall here in St. Mary's County. There's really not much else to say here other than that I'm pretty happy with both phones so far.</p>

<p>With this image from the Tudor Hall Garden, it was the first time I noticed that the Galaxy S25 Ultra managed a brighter image. It's kind of a difficult picture to process, with the glare from the sunset affecting both phones in some capacity.</p><p>The thing about taking pictures on your phone is that they can look pretty good on smaller screens. However, after seeing the iPhone's picture of the sundial, I was surprised to see that it just... doesn't look good. There aren't nearly as many details as the S25 Ultra, which becomes apparent when looking at the hedges surrounding the sundial.</p><p>With the last image above, we have another difficult scenario to process. Not only is the sun setting, but the lights from the restaurant are all over the place. When you start trying to pixel-peep, the iPhone actually captures more detail, especially if you look at the "OPEN" sign on the right side of the pictures. However, I'd have to say that the Galaxy S25 Ultra managed to take a picture that better resembled what I was actually seeing.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, the Galaxy S25 Ultra was given a chance to really flex its muscles a bit. Both phones were set to 25x zoom, as that's as far as the iPhone's digital zoom will let you go. Looking at the plaque, the text is legible in the iPhone's picture, but it looks a lot like it was generated by AI. Meanwhile, that's not even close to being the case with the S25 Ultra, as it's obvious that Samsung has the upper hand when it comes to telephoto images.</p>

<p>When you're walking around trying to take pictures with four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">different phones</a>, there's really not much time to analyze what you've captured. At the moment, I didn't realize how similar the pictures are between the Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Even while I was putting together the side-by-side examples, I ended up needing to double-check the pictures just to make sure I wasn't messing anything up.</p><p>In fact, a lot of what I said about the iPhone's pictures in the previous section rings true about the Pixel 9 Pro. And that includes the picture of the birds on the dock, as it's brighter than the picture from the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>However, unlike the iPhone, I was actually able to capture the bird spreading its wings before taking off. Considering that both Samsung and Google have had issues with moving subjects, I couldn't be happier to see the improvements made culminating in what we have now.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why a couple of the comparison pictures are different here than the other sections, your guess is as good as mine. When I went back to try and find the pictures on the Pixel, they apparently yeeted themselves from the phone. Thankfully, I took plenty of other pictures to make up for that, but I still don't know what could've happened.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Pixel 9 Pro manages to keep up with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, producing images that are both crisp and clean. And while the S25 Ultra looked more "true to life" with the picture of the bar, the Pixel 9 Pro did the same with the image of Duke's.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9jBYuwcWPWqgWqy6RkXRt4" name="s25-ultra-vs-pixel-9-pro-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra camera versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jBYuwcWPWqgWqy6RkXRt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the telephoto digital zoom test, it again was done at 25x in order to keep things the same across all of the devices. That's despite the Pixel 9 Pro and its Super Res Zoom being capable of delivering a 30x digital zoom.</p><p>One thing that surprised me about the Pixel 9 Pro is that it managed to make the text on the plaque look both less and more AI-enhanced than the S25 Ultra. There are some artifacts around some of the letters, but the 9 Pro also makes it look like someone went and traced over the words to make them appear bolder. Even still, I was quite impressed with how things turned out, as everything is clear and legible.</p>

<p>The last phone that I compared the Galaxy S25 Ultra to was its predecessor, the Galaxy S24 Ultra. On paper, the only difference between the two is the former features a 50MP telephoto lens compared to the 10MP sensor on the latter. In theory, that should mean that we end up with pictures that look more similar than the other phones.</p><p>And for the most part, that's exactly what we have here. Even in the third image, with both devices using 25x zoom, you'd have a tough time telling them apart if I didn't tell you which picture came from which phone.</p>

<p>If you need any more proof that these phones are using identical hardware, it doesn't get much better than the gallery of images above. With the exception of the sundial, the garden and front of Tudor Hall look practically identical. The differences are even more subtle than I thought they would be, which should make those who decided against upgrading feel good about the decision.</p>

<p>That being said, the super zoom comparison tells a different tale. It was almost like the Galaxy S24 Ultra didn't even try to sharpen the image at all. Instead, it almost feels as though it softened the picture. In fact, the S24 Ultra was the only phone of the four to do this, which definitely surprised me.</p><p>For the sake of full disclosure, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is currently running the latest One UI 7 beta. Seeing as the software isn't yet final, there's a non-zero chance that the beta software played a part in how this image was processed.</p>

<p>Something strange, for me at least, when I was on my way back home. For the first time ever, I actually pulled off to the side of the road to take a picture.</p><p>After the weather being quite uncooperative for the past couple of weeks, it was refreshing to have the clouds break and the sun shine through. Add in the fact that the time between sunset and dusk happens to be my favorite time to take pictures, on top of the clouds still clearing out, and it was just one of those "man, the sky looks beautiful moments."</p><p>So, I pulled over the car, rolled down the window, and just wanted to see whether any of these phones could recapture what I was seeing.</p>

<p>Out of all four phones that I used after pulling off to the side of the road, I think that the Pixel 9 Pro was the best. There are more details in the clouds, along with more vibrant colors that don't look fake.</p><p>While the iPhone seemingly managed to capture more light, the sunset fell victim to Apple's image processing. On the flip side, it's obvious to me that Samsung has made some substantial tweaks to the image tuning with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>When looking at the two Ultra pictures side-by-side, it just feels like something is off with the S24 Ultra. Again, we might just have to chalk this up to the One UI 7 beta, but we won't be able to know for sure until the final version is released.</p>

<p>Without burying the lede, I honestly think you couldn't go wrong with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro, or iPhone 16 Pro Max. Unless Samsung manages to work some magic with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, I don't think the Galaxy S24 Ultra does enough to warrant consideration when it comes to more difficult photos.</p><p>However, while I can't pick one device over the other, there is something that helps the Galaxy S25 Ultra stand out. Navigating through Samsung's Camera app is a much easier experience than the others.</p><p>Not in terms of just being able to take out your phone and snap a picture. But in actually trying to adjust the zoom, making sure all of your settings are correct, and giving you access to the bucket of tools that Samsung provides. If you just want a point-and-shoot camera, you'll be fine no matter what phone you decide on.</p><p>But if you care about more than tapping the shutter button, then Samsung is the clear winner. This might not be the case forever as Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-camera-9-8-rolls-out-alongside-the-march-feature-drop-with-new-tweaks">continues to make improvements</a> to its own Camera app. So we'll have to see what the future could bring.</p>

<ul><li>The Retroid Pocket Classic has been officially announced, with most of its specs being revealed.</li><li>This upcoming retro handheld will feature a 3.92-inch AMOLED display, and is powered by a "Qualcomm 4nm" chip.</li><li>Retroid has yet to share pricing or exactly what processor the Pocket Classic will feature, but it could be the Snadragon 4 Gen 2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Late last month, Retroid announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/retroid-pocket-flip-2-launch">Pocket Flip 2</a>, a clamshell handheld powered by Android. At the time, a second device was seen in the original announcement renders, but no other details were provided. Now, not only do we know that the Retroid Pocket Classic is on the way, but the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.com/channels/899605564361953300/1339770266544508958/1348845614393327637">recently revealed</a> most of its specs.</p><p>The most surprising aspect of the Pocket Classic is that Retroid is set to use a 3.92-inch AMOLED display with a 1240 x 1080 resolution. Most of the time, these retro handhelds rely on panels from older devices, and that's likely the case here. Rumors suggest that Retroid is sourcing display panels from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-wing-review">LG Wing</a>, which is a blast from the past in its own right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2888px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JqpZs5w4bxPKvhyaUorLrQ" name="retroid-pocket-classic-specs-render" alt="Retroid Pocket Classics specs overview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JqpZs5w4bxPKvhyaUorLrQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2888" height="1625" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides that, Retroid shared that the handheld is equipped with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage, and it even ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. Not to mention that it comes with a huge 5,000mAh battery and active cooling, which is honestly a bit of a shock.</p><p>Once released, we'll have a total of six different color options to choose from, each of which pays homage to various consoles from our childhood. There is one that stands out from the rest, as the "Classic 6" is modeled after the Sega Saturn and is the only one to include six buttons. The other five models all sport the traditional four-button ABXY layout.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tI0pi-TlmaA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>We don't exactly know why, but Retroid stopped short of naming the specific chip that it plans to use with its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a>. Instead, the marketing material only says that it's a "Qualcomm 4nm" processor. After doing a bit of research, we could be looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-4-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 4 Gen 2</a>, a processor released in 2023 and is found in a lot of great budget phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-12-5g-review">Redmi 12 5G</a>, Poco M7, and others.</p><p>Unfortunately, we also don't yet know what Retroid plans to price the Pocket Classic at. Based on the specs and the lack of any joysticks, which puts a ceiling on what systems you can comfortably enjoy, we wouldn't be surprised if it comes in around $150.</p><p>Then again, this is the first vertical handheld from the company since the original Retroid Pocket was released in 2019. That handheld launched at $99, so if Retroid wanted to get a bit "cute," we wouldn't put it past them to open pre-orders for the Pocket Classic at that price.</p>

Apparently, Motorola is working on launching an Edge 60 Stylus model.</p><p>Prominent tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1899350375108370675">Evan Blass took to X to post</a> an image of the alleged phone's render that showcases a bump on the bottom right corner of the device, indicating that it houses a stylus. The stylus will come attached to the device, and users don't have to purchase the accessory separately, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>What's more interesting is that the company looks to be pleasing those who like to listen to music the old-school way. The image from Blass even reveals what looks like a 3.5mm audio jack for those who like to "plug-and-play."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D4hoZsndtsHHqiQh97syW5" name="Screenshot-Moto-Edge-60-Stylus-Leak" alt="Motorola edge 60" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D4hoZsndtsHHqiQh97syW5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass/ X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When another X user checked if this was simply a rebrand to the successor of last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a>, the tipster added that "they're distinct devices." as it has the "Edge" form factor. At first glance, we see the end-to-end screen on the device,  showcasing rounded corners and slightly thicker bezels.</p><p>This device looks like a mid-range, sub-flagship model, unlike the more budget G models from the company. Furthermore, it looks like this new Edge Stylus will be available globally.</p><p>In other news, European prices for the Moto G 60 Edge lineup showed up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_edge_60_stylus_render_shows_that_moto_is_bringing_the_stylus_to_the_midrange-news-66890.php">in a recent leak</a>. This series will allegedly launch as a trio, with the Edge 60 Fusion costing €350, followed by the Edge 60 at €380, while the Edge 60 Pro will allegedly be priced at a higher €600. While it didn't mention a Stylus model, it could be placed somewhere closer to the Edge 60 in terms of price range, according to GSMArena.</p><p>Previous leaks on the Moto G 60 trio don't mention a stylus model either. Recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/motorola-edge-60-series-moto-g56-g86-global-pricing-leaked/">91Mobiles</a> leaked alleged colorways the trio could launch with. The publication states that the Edge 60 Fusion could come in Blue and Grey, the Edge 60 could be seen in green and sea blue, while the Pro version will have three colorways: Blue, Grape, and Green colors, all with 8GB or 12GB RAM and 256GB storage.</p>

<p>However, in a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1899511260959641886">post</a>, Evan Blass showed a few pictures of the alleged Moto Edge 60 Fusion showcased in official marketing pictures. The pictures indicate that the device will launch in three colorways that differ from what 91Mobiles stated. As seen above</p><p>There was still no mention of the Stylus model, so we'll have to wait and see what comes of it.</p>

I've taken trips with and without my DSLR camera, some with just a tablet, some with a VR headset alongside a mouse and keyboard, and others with just a phone in my pocket. Each of these setups is good for different types of trips, but what about the times you need a little bit of everything?</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-nearby-share-your-android-phone">Android Quick Share</a> finally made file transfer a breeze, enabling extremely fast, one-tap transfer between Android devices, Windows devices, or both. I regularly pass files between my Windows-based laptop and any number of Android phones in my possession, and it's made my life and job so much easier.</p><p>But what about sharing screens or even transferring mouse and keyboard input between devices? That's a lot harder, but some companies have created ecosystems that work well with each other in a nearly seamless way. People have stuck with Apple for this reason, and now a few Android companies have finally caught up, offering easy cross-device connectivity between phones, laptops, and tablets, all without having to download extra apps or paid services to get the job done.</p><p>I'm going to highlight what I think are the three best interconnectivity solutions available on Android today, all of which work a little differently and have a slightly different scope.</p>
<h2 id="hello-moto-2">Hello Moto</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xc68iwyFXVZW5R58FmJt93" name="Smart-Connect-new-dashboard" alt="Smart Connect new update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xc68iwyFXVZW5R58FmJt93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of all the available solutions, Motorola takes the cake for device simplicity. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Motorola Smart Connect</a> just requires you to have a Motorola phone or tablet, and the rest falls right in line. It requires the most setup of the three ecosystems I talk about today, but that's because you can use any Windows-based laptop to connect your phone or tablet as if they were one big, cohesive device.</p><p>Once you've got the Motorola Smart Connect software installed on your computer, pairing it with your Motorola smartphone or Lenovo tablet is just a QR code scan away. From there, all linked devices will share a clipboard and have easy file transfer. You can even pull up your phone or tablet's storage on your PC as if it were a USB drive.</p><p>What's particularly cool is that you can run individual phone apps on your PC, letting you multitask your favorite idle clicker game alongside those work spreadsheets, all without having to touch the phone. Motorola lets you control your phone or tablet with the same mouse and keyboard as your PC. So they feel like an extra monitor instead of separate devices running different operating systems. Plus, you can use your phone's camera as a webcam for any meeting, which could come in handy in several scenarios.</p>

<p>Samsung makes a lot of electronics. From washing machines to TVs and refrigerators to smartphones and tablets, the company does an impeccable job of cohesively connecting all these devices. Samsung smart home devices work with non-Samsung phones and computers via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/samsung-smartthings-home-insight-edge-ai-detailed" target="_blank">SmartThings</a> app, but for the scope of this article, interconnectivity between your phone, tablet, and laptop all have to be between Samsung Galaxy products.</p><p>It's easy to share your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>'s screen with a Samsung TV by tapping "share screen" in the notification shade. Moving windows and apps between a Samsung tablet and phone just requires you to enable multi-control. And if you're lucky enough to have a Samsung Galaxybook laptop, you can even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-multi-control-with-samsung-galaxy-devices">share your Samsung GalaxyBook's keyboard with your phone</a>.</p><p>You can also transfer files between devices by using familiar interfaces — either the share dialog on an Android device or File Explorer on Windows — as well as share clipboards between devices. There are few things handier than copying a link on your phone and being able to instantly paste it somewhere on your PC.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> has been around for the better part of a decade and provides an easy way to use your phone like a laptop, letting you hook it up via USB-C cable to any monitor to project UI that looks and works exactly like a PC. Samsung hasn't done much with DeX in a while but it still works well for those times when you need better multitasking and don't have a laptop around to do it.</p>

<p>But while I really like all the interconnectivity from Samsung, there's still a bit of setup that's required to get everything working together. Honor's Magic Ring, the company's oddly named interconnectivity solution, automatically recognizes and enables connectivity between any Honor device around it that's signed into the same Honor account.</p><p>Magic Ring is a centralized connectivity suite that shows all adjacent devices with all potential actions available for each. The same UI is found on every device with Magic Ring support — Honor tablets, phones, and laptops — so there's no misunderstanding about what devices support which functions.</p><p>If I tap the laptop icon, I can tap either screen sharing or input sharing, then tap the accompanying device to perform that action. In the case of my most recent work trip, tapping screen share and then tapping the tablet icon gave me an instant second monitor I could use while working from my hotel room.</p>

<p>Interconnectivity between devices is more than a gimmick or convenience. It's a huge part of what makes device ecosystems better than others and why people often choose to use Samsung or Honor devices over some other Android manufacturers.</p><p>These companies aren't alone in offering interconnectivity — OnePlus, for instance, offers auto-connect capabilities between devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> — but Honor and Samsung offer more devices than most other Android manufacturers, making their interconnectivity solutions a bit more valuable.</p><p>The recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Honor Alpha Plan</a> aims to go beyond current offerings by extending interconnectivity to all devices — not just ones made by Honor — including iPhones and other non-Android devices by utilizing the power of AI.</p><p>It remains to be seen just how well this works, but it's exciting to see interconnectivity continuing to be pushed. Who knows, Honor's model may eventually become ubiquitous in smart device connectivity the way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> is with smart home connectivity.</p>

<hr>
<p>Pixel 9a leaks keep on giving. This time, the phone was not just spotted but also seen in action. A leaker took the alleged Pixel 9a to the Lucha Libre match — a wrestling match in Mexico City — where they were seen filming the event with the device (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/pixel-9a-leak-shows-off-camera/">as first spotted by 9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qlJdTW62nOc">video</a> of the leak was posted on YouTube Shorts, and the tipster seems to be holding the alleged device in a black colorway. They first show off all the angles of the phone and then proceed to film the match with it as well.</p><p>First, the Pixel 9a seems to be held against a bag of snacks, showcasing the size of the device, which we expect to be 154mm tall and 73mm wide. After that, the leaker flips around the phone, showing us the rounded corners and the almost flat rear panel with the signature "G" logo and the camera array.</p><p>As previous leaks have indicated, the phone may see an overall flatter look with its rear panel, ditching its usual camera bump for a pill-shaped horizontal camera casing that sort of integrates the lens into the back panel of the device.</p><p>Furthermore, the phone is speculated to have two cameras on the back: a 48 MP primary lens and a 13MP ultrawide one. Which is what the leaker seems to be filming the Lucha Libre match with.</p>

<p>The supposed Pixel 9a was only showcased in the first few seconds of the video; after that, the leaker proceeded to film the match. The publication further notes that the leaker claimed to be filming with the device, showcasing the phone's zoom capabilities, as seen in the video above.</p><p>It remains unclear if all the shots were taken by the alleged Pixel 9a that was showcased at the start, however. While most of the details check out with previous leaks, it remains to be seen how the actual device will turn out.</p><p>Rumors suggest that Google's new mid-ranger will launch sometime in March, but it could also appear at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O in May this year</a>.

<ul><li>Disney Plus is trying to build interest for Andor Season 2, but it's doing so on YouTube in a way that's not just an ad run.</li><li>The first three episodes of Andor Season 1 are available on YouTube for viewers to watch, alongside a Season 1 recap.</li><li>Andor Season 2 will premier on Disney Plus on April 22.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Disney makes an interesting move to get more people excited about the second season of Andor.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tv/626966/andors-first-three-episodes-are-streaming-on-youtube">The Verge</a>, Disney Plus' original Star Wars show, Andor, has headed for YouTube to promote its upcoming second season. Instead of running what you'd expect: ads, the company is looking to grab the viewer's attention by dropping some of the first season on the platform — for free.</p><p>Disney started posting the videos on YouTube yesterday (Mar 10). All of the content is there, with the episodes running 39 mins, 35 mins, and 40 mins, respectively, for the first three. The streaming service has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL148kCvXk8pARjuC9IHQUH3YpHeW8UzP_">created a neat playlist</a> for users who'd like to binge these episodes for a little while.</p><p>What's more, if Disney has captivated you enough to head over to its platform and watch the rest (or Hulu as the post notes), there is a Season 1 recap video available. This video runs for roughly 15 minutes and hits you with everything you should keep in mind before the next run begins.</p><p>The publication highlights Andor's creator, Tony Gilroy, is preparing to host an hour-long "rewatch event" on YouTube on March 13.</p><p>Andor Season 2 will begin on April 22 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EuCoDo2k9A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>There's no getting around the fact that Disney Plus started enforcing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-paid-sharing-enforced-us-launch">paid sharing program</a> in the U.S. last September. Similar to what we've seen others do (Netflix), Disney Plus is letting subscribers add an "extra member" to their <em>household </em>account. Those with the Basic Plan can do so for an extra $6.99. Others who've purchased the Premium variant will see an additional $9.99 charge.</p><p>These were all things <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-explores-password-sharing-crackdown">talked about prior</a>, but Disney's CEO Bob Iger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown-begins-june-2024">confirmed</a> its arrival last spring. To quote Iger, he stated a couple of years back that he wanted "Disney Plus to become a growth business for Disney and that effort appears to be starting with new password-sharing initiatives."</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.disneyplus.com/news/next-on-disney-plus-march-2025">March is packed</a> with new things coming to Disney Plus, like the resurgence of a popular Marvel character through Daredevil: Born Again. The show kicked off on March 4 with a two-episode season premier and continues today (Mar 11) with episode three. Moana 2 is set for its streaming debut on March 12 alongside even more content for Hulu and ESPN Plus subscribers.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out several Gemini-backed features for its Workspace Business and Enterprise edition (Standard and Plus) users.</li><li>Meet grabs a new "Studio" feature dubbed "Studio Look" for camera clarity while Google Chat brings its in-app translation ability to more users.</li><li>The company recently brought a Gemini-powered side panel addition to Gmail, which lets users quickly add events to calendar from emails.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google continues to spread Gemini's influence across its Workspace suite of apps, and its latest update brings it to its communication sector.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/more-ai-powered-features-for-google-workspace-business-and-enterprise-editions.html">posted</a> another set of patch notes for how Gemini will enhance the Workspace experience for Business and Enterprise editions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/gemini-google-meet-chat-workspace/">9to5Google</a>). The update rolling out today (Mar. 11) concerns users with those editions who frequently use apps like Meet and Chat. The former is on the receiving end of the most Gemini enhancements this week as Google states Meet will pick up a new "Studio" feature addition.</p><p>Joining Google Meet will be Gemini's ability to "detect and enhance" the look of your portrait during a meeting via "Studio Look." The changelog states the AI leverages its machine-learning capabilities to get this done. In short, this means the AI will try to clarify your image and sharpen your appearance if things are fuzzy/blurry.</p><p>Google then reiterates a couple of Meet's existing features it discussed earlier this year, like "Studio Sound" and "Studio Lighting." The former enables the AI to "recreate and balance" your sound. Essentially, Google says this is Gemini working to fill in the gaps of your voice coming through your microphone if the frequency becomes distorted.</p><p>"Studio Lighting," on the other hand, leverages its machine learning to "simulate" a studio's lighting. There are a few device requirements to get this working, to which Google encourages users to check its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/14441737">full support document</a>.</p>

<p>Google brings awareness to another Meet feature called "generate background images." The company is essentially reiterating its existence as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/updates-for-generating-meeting-backgrounds-with-gemini.html">this already started rolling out</a> last week for Meet. Gemini gives users the following options: Professional office, bookshelf, stylish living room, cozy living room, tropical beach, fantasy castle, sci-fi spaceship.</p><p>Google Chat is picking up a Gemini update for Business and Enterprise editions called "translate for me." The company says the AI in Chat will automatically detect over 120 languages and translate them for users in their preferred choice. The update continues with a Gemini's addition in Google Drawing with "background image removal."</p><p>Both features for Chat and Drawing are available for users.</p><p>Regarding Meet, Google states the custom backgrounds, studio sound, and lighting will begin today (Mar. 11). However, Studio Look in Meet will begin next week on March 18. It's worth reiterating that these features are for Google's Workspace Business and Enterprise editions (Standard and Plus).</p><p>Google dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-calendar-gemini-ai-add-option-gmail-rollout">a Gemini update</a> for Gmail yesterday, which brought better integration between it and Calendar. Soon, users will notice an "add to calendar" button if Gemini detects important dates within an email. Clicking on it will have Gemini automatically create an event for that date (alongside its time) in your calendar. This seems to have been the culmination of what Google started last year via its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-15-pro-side-panel-rolling-out-now-for-google-workspace-labs-testers">Gemini 1.5 Pro Labs test</a> for users, which was the start of its AI-powered side panel feature in Workspace.</p>

<ul><li>Two Galaxy S25 Edge models show up in a UL Demko certification database.</li><li>The listing shows that both devices are carrying batteries with a rated capacity of 3,786mAh.</li><li>Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S25 Edge in mid-April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge sightings have increased lately, pointing to an impending launch somewhere closer to the second week of April — which isn't that far away.</p><p>A new leak reveals two models of the Galaxy S25 Edge that were listed on UL Demko and India's BIS Databases. These listings provide us not just alleged model numbers of the phone but also battery specifications — which have been rumored to be pretty small from the start.</p><p>Now, these listings so much as confirm the above. First spotted by The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetechoutlook.com/tech-whispers/samsungs-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-spotted-on-ul-demko-and-bis-databases-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-batteries-also-listed-on-the-bis-database/">TechOutlook</a>, the Galaxy S25 Edge is said to launch with a rated battery capacity of 3,786mAh, which may translate to the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-leaked-specs" target="_blank">3900mAh </a>capacity that previous leaks entailed.</p><p>The certifications showed up with model numbers <strong>EB-BS937ABY </strong>and <strong>EB-BS937ABE</strong><em> </em>on the UL Demko database, certified with certificate numbers <strong>DK-162562-UL</strong><em> </em>and<em> </em><strong>DK-162516-UL</strong>,<em> </em>as seen below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2NypzXr53wD3a2DpuXcK3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-Battery-Spotted-on-UL-Demco" alt="Listing showcasing battery specs of Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2NypzXr53wD3a2DpuXcK3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Tech Outlook)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This only indicates that you'd have to be plugged into a charger now and then if you choose to get the Galaxy S25 Edge. For comparison, the base Galaxy S25 model has 4000mAh battery capacity, and with Samsung trying to fit all of its latest AI features into the phone, the device could be heavily reliant on its core processing chip. It is rumored to come with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, like the rest of the Galaxy S25 series, and a pretty hefty 200MP primary camera.</p><p>The only reason behind this could be the fact that the Korean OEM could be chasing the slimness of the phone over the battery capacity and its inability to fit in a more powerful one. The device is tipped to weigh around 162g and measure 5.75mm thin, much like Techno's ultra-thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">Spark Slim</a>, which managed to fit in a massive 5200mAh battery — making it possible to get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>In other news, Samsung's next set of foldables could be launching closer to its summer Unpacked and the publication seems to have spotted model numbers of the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7 </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> as well. The latter's models were seen as <strong>EB-BF766ABE</strong>, <strong>EB-BF766ABY</strong>,<strong> EB-BF767ABE</strong>, and <strong>EB-BF767ABY</strong>, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will come with <strong>EB-BF966ABE</strong>,<em> </em>EB-BF966ABY,<em> </em>EB-BF967ABE,<em> </em>and<em> </em><strong>EB-BF967ABY</strong>.<em> </em>However, the certification didn't seem to divulge any information about the duo's specs.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The March 2025 VR Games Showcase revealed 20 new Meta Quest games coming this year, plus two existing Meta Quest games getting ports to other platforms. The show was jam-packed with action, and the big debut of Flat2VR Studios' huge library of upcoming games, but one theme shone through the big showcase: co-op games.</p><p>While some of the best Meta Quest games are single-player — Batman Arkham Shadow, Behemoth, and Metro Awakening are just a few from the past few months — my favorite VR games almost always involve playing with a friend.</p><p>Seven of the 22 announcements today focus on co-op gameplay, giving friends the opportunity to hang out and take challenges head-on while working together. Social experiences are the best part of VR, and that's what makes these upcoming Meta Quest games so dang exciting!</p>

<p>Population: One used to stand alone as the Meta Quest's only large-scale multiplayer shooter, but the field has widened in the past two years. Contractors Showdown and Ghosts of Tabor proved that the Quest was capable of big multiplayer experiences, and Forefront is here to bring a bit of Battlefield into VR.</p><p>Forefront is the latest title from Triangle Factory, the makers of Breachers and Hyper Dash, and it promises to deliver excellent squad-based combat with vehicles and semi-destructible environments.</p><p>Given how polished Breachers was at release and how effectively it translated some of the best Rainbow Six Siege mechanics to VR, I've got high hopes that this latest release will bring the heat to the Meta Quest when it debuts in early access sometime this summer.</p><p><strong>Check it out on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://forefrontvr.com/discord"><strong>Discord</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/forefront/28816918137899319"><strong>Meta Quest</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2981220/Forefront"><strong>Steam</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="reave-2">Reave</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nug3EVdMJUU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I've put a lot of hours into Dungeons of Eternity since its debut in mid-2023, and Reave looks to take the successful formula and combine it with the PvPvE concept of Ghosts of Tabor. Players will enter public dungeons as a party tasked with plundering treasure and clearing out the monsters along the way, but be aware that this dungeon is accessible by *anybody* playing the game.</p><p>That means there's a very real chance another party could ruin your day just as you round the final corner or collect a huge treasure, or a benevolent benefactor could very well bless you with riches untold. Humans are funny creatures, but can you trust them more than the nearest goblin or living skeleton? We'll have to find out sometime this year, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.gg/mZ3xSN4s9a"><strong>jump into the Discord now</strong></a> and get ready for the early access debut.</p>
<h2 id="zix-2">Zix</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sD0gIgiqBQA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Zix promises to be a co-op roguelike as you've never played before. From the surreal visuals to the "ever-morphing worlds," players should expect unique gameplay they can experience in awe with friends. In the game, you're tasked with being an Acolyte of Chaos, roaming three different worlds in search of chaotic energy that you can combine to create entirely new realms, mix and match enemies, and just get crazy with the reality around you.</p><p>Zix boasts what it calls a proprietary gesture-based combat and movement system that foregoes menus and button mashing with physical movement. Developer Hidden IO says you'll be "dashing, dodging, launching projectiles, and stringing together attacks" using nothing but the triggers, grips, and your imagination. Just as you think you've mastered the controls, you'll come face to face with massive bosses and challenges you didn't expect.</p><p><strong>Check it out on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/zix/8582035711867299/"><strong>Meta Quest</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/635700/ZIX/"><strong>Steam</strong></a><strong> and wishlist it for its Fall release!</strong></p>
<h2 id="exoshock-2">Exoshock</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TkTUhwryz4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Exoshock will be at GDC in just a week with full hands-on opportunities, but until then, we're getting a full taste of what to expect from this 1-4 player co-op PvE game inspired by Helldivers 2, Warhammer 40K, Halo, and FEAR. The game utilizes a vibrant sci-fi art style with procedurally generated environments, giving players a fresh experience every time they venture out with their squad.</p><p>Developer Polarity One says the environments are "hostile, oppressive, and alive" as the ships you board teeter on the brink of destruction from the monstrous invaders. Exoshock promises to be "more than just another shooter" as it aims to push the boundaries of existing cooperative VR concepts. You'll pick one of three roles with a dedicated focus, including Flanker, Suppressor, and Technician, each toting weapons the developer says feel visceral and powerful. We're expecting this one later this year.</p>
<h2 id="roboquest-vr-2">Roboquest VR</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v13eqq7HflI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The original Roboquest release was an extremely popular roguelike on Steam, garnering over 16,000 "overwhelmingly positive" reviews on Steam since its August 2020 release. Now, Flat2VR Studios is bringing the insanely fast-paced action to the Meta Quest this Fall, challenging players to hone their reaction times as they venture out alone or with a friend.</p><p>If you've played the original, you'll immediately be familiar with the vibrant, detailed visuals, liquid-smooth gameplay, and overwhelming hordes of enemies that pummel you throughout every level. Randomly generated environments keep things fresh every run, and the upgrades you find along the way will prepare you for the massive bosses that dot the landscape to provide fresh challenges.</p><p>Grab a big ol' Gatling gun and a friend for Roboquest VR's release this Fall and <strong>wishlist it </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151760/Roboquest_VR/"><strong>on Steam</strong></a><strong> now</strong>. We expect a Meta Quest store listing to go live before the release.</p>

<p>The Windlands series was renowned for its free-flying, grappling hook-based platforming gameplay, and now those developers are taking their expertise of unique VR locomotion to a new co-op adventure.</p><p>Players will shoot, slingshot, glide, and guard against enemies as they make their way through exciting levels with friends, culminating in titan-sized boss battles to conquer at the end. It sounds incredibly exciting, and the studio's pedigree gets us even more pumped for its release sometime this year.</p>
<h2 id="breachers-updates-2">Breachers updates</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X6oKZIIOOfE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Breachers has been one of my all-time favorite multiplayer VR games since its release in Spring 2023, and the game's 2-year anniversary comes along with a brand-new gadget that's sure to trip even seasoned veterans up: the clone projector gadget. This new gadget projects an image of yourself anywhere you place it, acting as the perfect way to fool your enemies while you lie in wait in the shadows.</p><p>I play Breachers weekly with a group of friends, and the squad-based action never seems to get old. Triangle Factory delivered a seriously solid experience in April 2023 and has been building it up since then, delivering free new maps at regular intervals as well as season passes and skins for folks who love that sort of thing.</p><p>The new gadget is available now, so what are you waiting for? <strong>Pick up a copy of Breachers on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/breachers/5740397619319389/"><strong>Meta Quest</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/breachers/"><strong>PSVR 2</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1922010/Breachers/"><strong>Steam</strong></a><strong> today!</strong></p>

<ul><li>Samsung is currently rolling out a Good Lock launcher update for Galaxy devices through the Galaxy Store via v3.0.10.4.</li><li>The update is minimal, only offering stabilization enhancements for apps alongside "phrase" changes.</li><li>Samsung has crafted a complete Good Lock redesign for foldables and smartphones in One UI 7.</li><li>One UI 7 has been confirmed to arrive in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung was spotted rolling out a couple of refreshments for its primary Galaxy app launcher in One UI.</p><p>A Good Lock update was seen rolling out for Galaxy device owners via the Galaxy Store by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-rolls-out-new-good-lock-update-with-stability-fixes/">SammyGuru</a>. According to the publication, users should soon start noticing and downloading/installing Good Lock v3.0.10.4. The page <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.android.goodlock">has been updated</a> recently, stating it's rolling out as of today, March 11.</p><p>Users checking the store should begin seeing the patch today, which is pretty minimalistic in terms of what it offers.</p><p>Samsung's patch notes are brief, stating it is "improving app stabilization." The company doesn't explicitly explain which apps this is aimed at. Additionally, the changelog states the update is "modifying some phrases." As the publication theorizes, this could mean Samsung is making its app descriptors for functions/features a little more clear for the end user.</p>

<p>Ahead of One UI 7's reveal on the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung discussed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">a few key details</a> users should be aware of. The main highlight is the company has completely redesigned Good Lock for its next-generation of software. Primarily, this overhaul concerns the experience its foldable users will have on the Flip 6 and Fold 6. Samsung stated "The overall composition of the main app has been changed for UI convenience."</p><p>Samsung's standard slab phones will see improvements — which you can see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">on the Galaxy S25</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, that announcement saw the inclusion of Good Lock to global regions. The company notes that, for the first time via One UI 7, Good Lock can be used "in all countries" for the first time.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-home-up-complete-customize-demo">demo video</a> highlighted by users on Reddit showcased some of Good Lock's refreshes for the Home Up module. Through One UI 7, users will have complete control over <em>how </em>their device's apps look. The video shows the ability to rotate apps, folders, and widgets without worrying about grid restrictions. While the vast majority are left on the outside looking in, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">recently announced</a> One UI 7 is on deck for an official rollout in April.</p>

And I can't wait to see where this partnership leads.</p><p>Facer CEO Ariel Vardi, who worked with Eaton when they preloaded Facer on Fossil watches, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.facer.io/facer-appoints-brook-eaton-as-chief-product-officer-to-expand-oem-partnerships-and-lead-its-113e0a881f1c">described</a> some ambitious-sounding goals for Eaton to "lead Facer's next phase of growth," with his role focusing on the following:</p>
<ul><li>"Bringing Facer to even more smartwatches and exploring integrations with other connected devices."</li><li>"Elevating Facer's user experience, marketplace, and personalization features."</li><li>"Pushing the boundaries of smartwatch customization and how users interact with their devices."</li></ul>
<p>"Customization is a core part of the smartwatch experience, and there's still so much potential to explore," Eaton says. "My goal is to expand Facer's footprint across more devices and platforms while continuing to innovate."</p><p>I wrote last year about my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">frustration that Wear OS 5 blocks Facer</a> because Google shifted to battery-saving XML watch faces (good), banned old formats that allowed for more creativity (reasonable but disappointing), and required users to buy watch faces from the Play Store (baffling and unnecessary).</p><p>Facer announced at the time that it was "working hard with Google to bring the Facer service" to watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, but couldn't resolve things before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> launched. It's been months since then, and we're still waiting for better watch faces.</p><p>I don't know if Eaton can break through Google's gridlock before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> arrives. But we definitely need better watch face "customization" across brands, and we should watch closely to see where Facer goes next with Eaton's new direction.</p>
<h2 id="unfinished-business-2">Unfinished business</h2>

<p>I'm sure long-time Wear OS fans might have mixed feelings about Fossil watches. They carried the brand for years when Samsung Tizen was all the rage, but at a time when Wear OS 2 wasn't all that good. Then Google left its old partner in the lurch to focus on a more profitable partnership with Samsung — leaving Fossil struggling to keep up with updates until it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-wear-os-exit-shows-platform-improvements-less-competitive">exited the business for good</a>.</p><p>I came into Wear OS after the transition, but I still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-smartwatches-have-a-fashion-problem-hybrids-are-the-answer">feel the absence of Fossil's more stylish designs</a> compared to the distinctly techy vibes of most Android watches. Considering the current Wear OS lineup — Google, Samsung, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Mobvoi — it's clear we're trending toward the ecosystem being dominated by mobile brands rather than watch brands, with Mobvoi as the one holdout.</p><p>With that context, I look at Fossil's Android watch tenure as holding out against a stacked deck. And since Eaton kept Fossil watches relevant for all those years while dealing with bigger brands like Google, I hope that experience will pay off at Facer.</p>
<h2 id="where-facer-can-go-next-2">Where Facer can go next</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cLU4cq5oNV9uMKHJTXJEqH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-facer-pokemon-2.jpeg" alt="A custom Facer watch face showing Mewtwo in a pod on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cLU4cq5oNV9uMKHJTXJEqH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Facer watch on the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Facer's press release talked about "deepening platform integrations across Apple Watch, Wear OS, Android AOSP, and RTOS," so Eaton's work won't focus solely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a>. Aside from Garmin, most RTOS fitness watches only have a handful of watch faces despite the recent push toward AMOLED displays. Facer support on more watches would certainly give them a breath of fresh air and creativity.</p><p>Still, I think that if Eaton could make Facer a closer partner with Google, in particular, that would be the ideal outcome.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> and Android's open system make it easier to allow for the best possible complications on Wear OS watch faces; that way, choosing a fun watch face doesn't necessarily preclude you from seeing relevant data, too.</p><p>The Play Store just isn't a great place to search through watch faces, so developers and artists don't have much incentive to <em>make</em> watch faces and Wear OS 5 users may not bother to look or spend money. Letting Facer handle curation and categorization — as it has for a decade — is a better system, and it should be easy to filter out and disable downloads for non-XML watch faces.</p><p>And I'm certainly curious how Eaton intends to "push the boundaries" of customization through Facer. Will this involve AI art, which would give users limitless options but potentially annoy the creators on Facer's platform? Perhaps watch faces that change based on your health and fitness progress?</p><p>Wherever things go next, I'm optimistic that Vardi and Eaton can take things in an exciting new direction for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> — if Google lets them.</p>

<hr>
<p>While we await the Pixel 9a launch, we already get to see what Google's next flagship series could potentially look like. The Computer Aided Design (CAD) renders of the trio Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL have now surfaced, which indicates very minimal changes over the predecessor models.</p><p>The renders were shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10">Android Headlines</a> in conjunction with tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks">OnLeaks</a>. They not only reveal the design but also some of the expected dimensions are shared.</p><p>Per the publication, the Pixel 10 is sticking to the near-identical design of the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, meaning it will have the same 6.3-inch display and will measure 152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm.</p><p>The Pixel 10 renders also suggest that the device will feature flat matte-finished sides again with minimal curves towards the edges for a better grip. The power button followed by volume rockers is placed on the right pane of the handset. The shared renders also appear in a pink hue as seen on the previous iteration.</p>

<p>The one big change, however, is expected to be in the camera segment as the leak suggests we would see a triple camera setup on the Pixel 10, unlike the Pixel 9, which came with dual cameras.</p><p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro">latest Pixel 10 Pro renders</a> also indicate that it will also be identical to the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, including the dimensions. It is likely to measure 152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm, similar to the previous iteration. We will again likely be seeing the same 6.3-inch display. This appears to be good news for the cases used on the Pixel 9 series, as it would fit the successors as well.</p>

<p>The Pixel 10 Pro will also be retaining the triple camera system comprising a primary lens, ultra-wide-angle camera, and a periscope lens. Unlike the matte sides on the Pixel 10, the Pro model is expected to be coming in a glossy finish.</p><p>The case appears to be the same with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-xl">Pixel 10 Pro XL model</a> as well because the shared renders suggest the same design setup as the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The former will have a 6.8-inch display accompanied by 162.7 x 76.6 x 8.5mm dimensions — nearly identical to the previous iteration. The XL stands out to be the flagship model in the lot — thanks to the large display and a bigger battery is also expected.</p>

<p>While all three Pixel 10 series phones aren't changing much in design aesthetics, we expect some solid changes in the internals, which can include the new and presumably powerful Tensor G5 chip.</p><p>Like the predecessors, the launch of the trio is expected to be sooner — maybe a couple of months after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-2022-preview">Google IO event,</a> which is going to be held in May.

<ul><li>A standout improvement in the One UI 7 beta for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the revamped app continuity feature.</li><li>Before, users had to manually set up which apps could switch screens, but One UI 7 simplifies things with three new options for app continuity, giving users more control.</li><li>One UI 7 also gives the Galaxy Z Fold 6’s taskbar a much-needed upgrade.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 has jumped into Samsung’s One UI 7 beta program, and it’s already showing off some upgrades designed specifically for its foldable form. The update introduces a few tricks from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">top-tier foldables</a> like the Pixel Fold to make the experience more seamless.</p><p>One of the standout tweaks in the One UI 7 beta for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is a smoother app continuity feature. Sure, the phone already had a basic version that lets apps switch between the main and cover screens, but this update fine-tunes the whole process.</p><p>Previously, though, users had to manually set up which apps could switch between the main and cover screens. But with One UI 7, Samsung is making things easier by adding three new options for app continuity, giving users more control, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/jspring86az/status/1898631350695194890" target="_blank">Jeff Springer</a> on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/one-ui-7-adds-this-pixel-fold-feature-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-6/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p>

<p>The One UI 7 beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">kicked off on March 6 for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6</a>, rolling out gradually in select regions like India, South Korea, the UK, and the US.</p><p>Once you install the One UI 7 beta, you’ll spot three fresh settings for app continuity, such as "Always," "Swipe to continue," and "Never." As the names suggest, "Always" keeps your app moving to the cover screen every time you close the phone, while "Never" stops it completely.</p><p>Meanwhile, the "Swipe to continue" option gives you control. It only moves the app to the cover screen if you swipe to confirm, similar to how it works on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and Pixel Fold. If you don’t swipe in time, the phone just locks.</p><p>As shown in Springer’s screenshots, this toggle is tucked away in the Display tab of Settings. Once you turn it on, you can swipe to move apps to the cover screen when you close the phone. The menu does mention that some apps might not work perfectly, but it doesn’t go into details.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-notable-upgrades-2">A few notable upgrades</h2>
<p>One UI 7 also tweaks how the Galaxy Z Fold 6’s taskbar works, fixing a major limitation from One UI 6. Previously, you had to choose between keeping the taskbar always visible or hiding it completely. Now, there’s more flexibility.</p><p>With One UI 7, the taskbar also stays visible on the home screen but automatically hides when you open an app. If you need it back, just swipe up from the bottom of the screen, and it pops right up.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-122">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The OnePlus 13T is shaping up to be a compact powerhouse, with leaks hinting at battery, pricing, and hardware details.</li><li>Expected to launch around May, it could be the most affordable phone rocking the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.</li><li>A 6.3-inch display and a 50MP dual-camera setup make it more "mid-sized" than truly compact.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors about the OnePlus 13T, the company's upcoming compact flagship, are making the rounds, and a new one has given us some juicy details, including battery specs and a clue on pricing.</p><p>A reliable tipster on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5140922661342256" target="_blank">Weibo</a> has claimed that the OnePlus 13T could drop around May (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-13T-Cheapest-Snapdragon-8-Elite-compact-phone-to-launch-soon-with-massive-battery-onboard.974225.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). This high-end phone might give the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best compact models</a> a run for their money by packing the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip at a price that undercuts other Android flagships in its class.</p><p>Previous leaks suggest the OnePlus 13T will pack a 6.3-inch display and a 50MP dual-camera setup. While it’s smaller than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>'s 6.82-inch screen, a 6.3-inch display is more "mid-sized" than truly "compact" by today’s standards.</p><p>Even with the OnePlus 13T’s expected budget-friendly pricing, some trade-offs are likely. It’s rumored to have a dual-camera setup instead of a more advanced multi-lens system. What that second lens does—whether it’s a telephoto or ultra-wide—is still a mystery, though.</p><p>The leak also mentions that the OnePlus 13T will stick with an optical fingerprint sensor, keeping it in line with older OnePlus flagships instead of jumping to the ultrasonic tech found in the OnePlus 13.</p><p>The rumored device is expected to pack the biggest battery in its class, with a rumored 6000mAh capacity, which is the same as the larger OnePlus 13.</p><p>Originally rumored as the OnePlus "Mini," the phone was leaked as the 13T last month. With OnePlus skipping "T" models since the 2022 OnePlus 10T, this launch could signal a comeback for the once-dormant lineup.</p><p>If you’re after something a bit smaller than the OnePlus 13, it might be worth holding out for the OnePlus 13T.</p>

We don't know what the exact schedule looks like as yet, but Google did say that the first day of I/O 2025 will begin "with keynotes, followed by breakout sessions, workshops, demos, networking opportunities, and more continuing on day two."</p><p>However, it didn't get into the weeds of what it will be announcing (obviously), but we Android fanatics have a good idea as to what we expect will come out of this year's event. Let's jump in.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-is-google-i-o-2025"><span>When is Google I/O 2025?</span></h2>
<p>Google I/O is all set to take place starting on May 20 this year with the first keynote beginning at 10 am PT. Google revealed this year's I/O date following its traditional puzzle format, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-used-the-gemini-api-and-ai-studio-to-make-the-i-o-2025-puzzle">was interestingly designed</a> using the Gemini API and AI Studio.</p><p>Taking place at Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountain View, California, and will also be livestreamed for the rest of the folks who can't make it to the event. Google will announce its newest products, innovations in AI, upgrades to Android, and more.</p>

<p>The tech giant indicated in the date reveal that registrations for the event <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/">are now open</a>. Developers who are interested in attending the event get to register for free, and this will keep them posted about all things I/O, including updated schedules closer to the event.</p><p>That said, developers don't have to register for the live event since it is open to all. However, to customize your experience at I/O and make the most of your time there, Google suggests that developers create their Google Developer Profiles.</p><p>For the rest of the folks who intend to tune into the event online, Google will livestream the event in tandem via its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/">official page</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Google">YouTube </a>channel. While it's too early for Google to put out a livestream link, we will update this article when it does.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA" name="Android-16-Pixel9PF" alt="The logo for Android 16 on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The next big OS upgrade for Pixel and Android devices could be a part of this year's I/O. We're talking about Android 16, which also goes by a fun internal codename, "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-codename-sooner-launch-speculation">Baklava</a>."  This one seems quite obvious, not just to us but also to you as a reader, considering the two beta versions of Android 16 currently out to people who'd want to take the OS for a spin on eligible Pixels.</p><p>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">we received confirmation at MWC</a> that Android 16 will be released much earlier—in June, considering the teams have reached something called the "Trunk Stable" stage, where all the developers contribute their efforts towards a single branch of code.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:633px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.40%;"><img id="Nu9tEJdJtjLThotgChRnuT" name="android-16-beta-1-app-adaptability-updates-example" alt="Google is bringing app adaptability updates to Android 16 Beta 1, which is designed to help larger displays showcase apps fully." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nu9tEJdJtjLThotgChRnuT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="633" height="357" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The company’s President of the Android ecosystem, Sameer Samat, said that the tech giant is on track for its June release, which is super close to when the I/O is happening this year (get where this is going?). And with Samat stating they're likely to highlight more features ahead of launch, I/O may see some fun Android 16 features show up.</p><p>We're specifically excited to see the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed"> Live Updates </a>feature that everyone with the Beta version is chatting about, along with a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16#section-other-new-features-in-android-16"> more stable version of audio sharing.</a></p>
<h2 id="pixel-9a-2">Pixel 9a?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XJrBJTbAnK5LULvLJybsBG" name="google-pixel-8a-official-lifestyle-obsidian-01.jpg" alt="A person holding an Obsidian Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XJrBJTbAnK5LULvLJybsBG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last year, Google threw us a curveball and launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> way ahead of schedule. We would love to see it happen this year as well, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a>. Rumors do point to a March launch; if not, it could show up at this year's I/O.</p><p>The most recent leaks indicate that the mid-ranger will be letting go of its pill-shaped camera bump for a sleeker look that embeds the lens into the back panel of the phone. The device could come with a primary 48MP lens and a 13MP ultrawide camera. It could also get AI features from the Pixel 9 series like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a> and Reimagine in Magic Editor.</p><p>Other leaks stated that the device will come out in four colorways, sporting 128GB and 256GB storage options. The Google Pixel 9a should use the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Google Tensor G4</a> processor as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>. This year's version will fall under the same $450-$500 price range. Showcasing a 5,100mAh battery, 23W wired and 7.5W wireless charging, an under-display fingerprint sensor, and Wi-Fi 6E. While these are some of its specs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a#section-google-pixel-9a-design-and-display">here's</a> everything we'd love to see with the Pixel 9a.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-2">Android XR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another exciting thing that Google has openly been hinting about is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/looks-like-google-is-serious-about-android-xr-after-all">Android XR.</a> And we're hoping to see a full reveal of its capabilities at I/O this year. For starters, XR essentially means eXtended Reality and is Google's latest software platform, made "in collaboration with Samsung."</p><p>This software will potentially bring apps to smart glasses, AR glasses, and mixed-reality headsets. Sameer Samat, president of the Google ecosystem, told Android Central that they "never stopped working on" XR despite these public failures and that the "Gemini era" means "the time is right for XR."</p><p>Last year, it sneakily showed off a prototype of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">Google's AR glasses </a>while showing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-project-astra-could-land-on-your-phones-this-month">Project Astra's </a>capabilities. Additionally, Samsung also showed off its mixed reality headset dubbed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-vs-meta-quest-3">Project Moohan</a>" at the MWC last week. Samsung's headset will technically be powered by Android XR. With the company being openly showcasing it, we have a hunch we'll see more of it during I/O 2025.</p>
<h2 id="wear-os-6-2">Wear OS 6</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng" name="google-pixel-watch-3-build-a-workout-on-watch.jpg" alt="Build workout on Pixel Watch 3 directly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We don't expect to see a Wear OS 6 launch; however, last year's event gave us a glimpse of what we could expect from Wear OS 5. Considering Google may follow suit, it could probably show off some of the next Wear OS's capabilities.</p><p>For now, what we do know is that Wear OS 6 will power the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, and eventually OnePlus Watch 4. The tech giant hasn't officially announced anything about this year, but according to our wearables lead, Michael Hicks, credible reports suggest that "Gemini will replace Assistant on Wear OS soon and that a major hardware upgrade could make this version more powerful than ever."</p><p>That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">here's what we wish</a> will come with Wear OS 6.</p>
<h2 id="plenty-of-ai-2">Plenty of AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SQGiFaENVPagDxFZeZo6T" name="shruti-google-io-badge.png" alt="Google I/O 2024 check-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SQGiFaENVPagDxFZeZo6T.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, we will also be counting the number of times Google says "AI" this year while hoping for it to show off more of Gemini's latest skills as it did at I/O 2024. Recent rumors indicate that Google Assistant will be fully replaced by Gemini and that "Hey Google" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/looks-like-a-new-wake-word-could-be-replacing-hey-google">could be a thing of the past.</a></p><p>We're keeping our fingers crossed and eyes peeled if and when Google will show off its upcoming flagship device, aka the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a>, at least a quick short tease. Rest assured, this year's I/O will be filled with the latest tech developments within the company.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The third time's the charm. This is a pretty cliche term that can be applied to anything, but it's especially true for the OnePlus Watch 3, OnePlus's incredibly successful third attempt at making a full-fledged smartwatch solution.</p><p>Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> relaunched the brand's hopes of having a successful smartwatch by introducing the first dual-CPU, dual-OS smartwatch powered by Wear OS. It got several things right — most notably battery life — but failed to meet the rigorous fitness tracking expectations that Wear OS watches are known for.</p><p>I'm happy to report that OnePlus ironed things out with its unique smartwatch architecture, which not only <em>improved</em> battery life over last year's watch but also fixed all the issues I had with fitness and workout tracking accuracy. The display is better and more eye-friendly, the rotating crown actually <strong>does</strong> something this year, and the company is offering an additional year of security updates.</p><p>It's a generational leap, as our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">OnePlus Watch 2 vs OnePlus Watch 3</a> comparison proclaims, and it's well worth your hard-earned money, even if there are a few things missing.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-watch-3-price-availability-and-specs"><span>OnePlus Watch 3: Price, availability, and specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="izJLqptcYjzuei8gewjjDV" name="oneplus-watch-3-with-box-powering-on" alt="The OnePlus Watch 3 with its box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/izJLqptcYjzuei8gewjjDV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 retails for $329.99 USD or $449.99 CAD and comes in two colorways: Obsidian Titanium (black with a black band) and Emerald Titanium (silver with green band). OnePlus only offers one size, and neither color option supports LTE connectivity. The watch was initially scheduled to ship at the end of February but was delayed until April <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-pushes-open-sale-of-watch-3-after-meda-error">due to a typographical error</a> on the watch.</p><p>OnePlus sells a handful of different band styles and colors, including a blue one that matches the Ocean Blue OnePlus 13. Any 22mm strap will work on either watch, though, so you don't have to stick to OnePlus's own selections if you don't want to.</p><p>The watch ships with a charging dock and a red cable in the box. You'll need a OnePlus charger to get the fastest charging speeds, and you can use the one that comes with any OnePlus phone.</p>

<p>If the OnePlus Watch 3 has any one overarching theme, it's improvement to the point of excellence. OnePlus has come a long way since the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-watch-review">OnePlus Watch</a> launch in 2021 and now offers best-in-class performance, battery life, health tracking accuracy, and hardware design.</p><p>Essentially, the only things "wrong" with the watch are things it's missing. Everything it does is great, and that's what makes this an easy-to-recommend watch.</p>

<p>When choosing a smartwatch, you often have to choose two major features at the expense of a third. Do you want great battery life, excellent fitness tracking capabilities, or lots of apps to play with? Galaxy Watches and Pixel Watches almost all exclusively offer great fitness tracking and app support but, with the exception of the Galaxy Watch Ultra, have to be charged <em>every single day</em>.</p><p>Smartwatches from companies like Garmin or Coros offer great fitness tracking and super long battery life but lack the apps of a Wear OS watch. The OnePlus Watch 3 is able to cover <em>all three</em> of these pillars without issue, and it's seriously impressive.</p><p>With AOD on, sleep tracking every night, and one hour of tracked exercise every day, I regularly got a full 4 days of battery life from the OnePlus Watch 3. While that's similar to the OnePlus Watch 2, the Watch 3 is able to do all this without the heat rate sensor problems and occasional notification issues the Watch 2 suffered from.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC" name="oneplus-watch-3-battery-modes" alt="The two battery modes of the OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Out of the box, the watch comes with AOD disabled, which will add roughly another day to your battery life. If you don't care about sleep tracking but just want this as a workout tracker and a daytime notification hub, you'll get a full 6 days of use from a single charge. Typically, with this configuration — AOD off and no sleep tracking, just wearing it during the day and tracking a 1-hour exercise — you could stretch that to day 7.</p><p>When the battery <em>eventually</em> gets low, topping up takes no time at all. In typical OnePlus style, a 20-minute charge will add about 75% to the battery, and another 20 minutes will bring it to a full charge. Even if you only had a few minutes to top it up before walking out the door, you'll absolutely get a full day's worth of use without worry.</p><p>If you don't care about Wear OS apps at all and just want fitness tracking, notifications, and sleep tracking, the OnePlus Watch 3's battery save mode will make it last over two weeks on a single charge. While this mode makes it more like a Garmin watch, you have the flexibility to switch back to regular "Smart mode" to get your apps back at any time.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>This is the best digital crown on any smartwatch, no contest.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 addresses a number of design and display changes I've wanted to see on smartwatches for a while. It includes a rotating crown at the 2 o'clock position instead of at the awkward 3 o'clock position, making it better for working out if you prefer the crown facing your hand.</p><p>This digital crown is larger than the one on the Watch 2 and, again, actually works as a rotating crown to scroll through menus. It's got a lovely grippy texture on it which, combined with the size, makes it incredibly easy to use. It's also got Pixel Watch-like haptics when scrolling which further enhances its appeal. This is the best digital crown on any smartwatch, no contest.</p>

<p>OnePlus increased the screen size and reduced the bezels on the Watch 3 versus the last two, all while keeping the size of the watch the same size. The bezel looks much nicer to me now that it has a protective metal bezel around the face, plus the 10-minute tick marks add a bit of visual flare that I see as an improvement to the design over the Watch 2's all-glass front.</p>

<p>The watch also uses a vibrant, bright DC-dimmed OLED panel that's easy to see in the sun but also that won't cook your eyes in a dark room. That's all without sacrificing brightness or display quality. A win-win if I ever saw one. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-smartwatches-have-a-flicker-problem-the-oneplus-watch-3-fixed-it">Lots of other smartwatches use PWM dimming</a>, which isn't great for anyone sensitive to flicker, meaning OnePlus is taking the lead on Wear OS eye health.</p>

<p>Last year, I wore a OnePlus Watch 2 and a Pixel Watch 3 to a Spartan Race. The OnePlus Watch 2 did a decent job but it fell victim to a heart rate sensor problem that regularly happened to me most of the time I wore it. Essentially, the watch seemed to ignore any high heart rate data if your heart rate spiked too rapidly. Given the intensity of the workouts I usually put myself through, this watch simply wasn't a good match for me.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 fixes all of that and is not only right in line with data from the Pixel Watch 3 — which I've been wearing since its release because of its heart rate sensor accuracy — but it also does <strong>several</strong> things better than the Pixel Watch 3 from a fitness tracking standpoint.</p><p>First up is the health dashboard. OnePlus OHealth app (not a fan of this app name, but whatever) makes excellent use of screen space and presents eight different data points without scrolling: daily steps taken, calories burned, workout minutes, activity sessions, heart rate with averages and a graph, sleep time plus a graph, mind and body score, and SpO2 measurements.</p>

<p>The Fitbit app, which is used by the Pixel Watch 3, only shows 5 data points upfront, so OnePlus has a massive advantage in design because the most important average metrics are in full view the moment you open the app.</p><p>The downside is that it's not as customizable as Fitbit's view. What you see is what you get with the OnePlus OHealth app, for better or worse.</p><p>The same design principles apply to the rest of the OnePlus Watch 3 experience, as well. When you finish an outdoor run or walk, the OnePlus Watch 3 displays a nice little map complete with a fantastic breakdown of your fitness metrics, including easy-to-read graphs and additional data if you want.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.03%;"><img id="2kJbdr5aM5YfZJmit4EkSm" name="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-3-post-workout-data-on-watch" alt="Comparing workout data available on the OnePlus Watch 3 versus the Google Pixel Watch 3 after a workout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kJbdr5aM5YfZJmit4EkSm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1291" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel Watch 3 tells you "good job" and gives a handful of stats, but the way the information is presented is often far too succinct. Any additional information can only be found in the Fitbit app on your phone, and even then, lots of it is hidden behind a paywall.</p><p>I also love that all of my watch data from the OnePlus Watch 3 is kept on my phone and my watch. OnePlus uses standardized cloud data to analyze my workouts for some of its AI processing functions, but my actual workout data isn't being processed anywhere in the cloud. It's all done on the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5670px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.08%;"><img id="e29umMwSvRhPHbiDhQDdKY" name="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-3-sleep-data" alt="Comparing sleep data between the OnePlus Watch 3 and the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e29umMwSvRhPHbiDhQDdKY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5670" height="2613" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That is not only nicer for privacy reasons, but it also means there's no monthly subscription to pay for to get all your data. Samsung also does this, so OnePlus isn't alone, but it's a nice change coming from the Fitbit subscription-laden Pixel Watch.</p><p>OnePlus also includes some truly useful data in each workout summary that I don't see on my Pixel Watch or in Fitbit.</p><p>On the OnePlus OHealth app, the map generated after an outdoor walk or run is not only more visually rich than on the Pixel — it shows a proper satellite view by default — but it's animated similarly to a hiking map generated through AllTrails. On top of that, you can select from two of eight data points to display on this map, complete with different line designs, map and route styles, and different video lengths to generate for the animated map.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.01%;"><img id="XKbvcc6JVFsFr29DqqqRS8" name="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-3-post-workout-map-data" alt="Comparing map data generated from walks, runs, and cycling by a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKbvcc6JVFsFr29DqqqRS8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4320" height="2247" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seeing all this data on a map is truly useful for anyone training to get more physically fit as it can help directly identify problem points on a usual route, plus where and how you can specifically improve over time. It's genius, and it fits right in with a lot of other things going on with this watch.</p>

<p>None of this matters if the watch isn't accurate, and I'm happy to report that OnePlus has completely fixed this aspect of its latest smartwatch. I've completed dozens of workouts while wearing the OnePlus Watch 3 and the Pixel Watch 3 at the same time — one on each wrist — and I've been impressed with OnePlus' metrics.</p><p>This is a watch I'm confident wearing for any workout, and I can even wear it fairly loosely and still get great metrics thanks to redesigned LEDs and heart rate sensors.</p><p>While the capture metrics were largely identical, one thing kept me coming back to using the OnePlus Watch 3 for all my workouts: auto-pause. It's not a revolutionary feature, nor is it the only watch that does this, but OnePlus's auto-pause works so incredibly well that it felt like a game changer for me. It nearly-instantly auto-paused my walking and cycling workouts the moment I stopped, and it impressed me every time.</p>

<p>I wore the Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus Watch 3, and OnePlus Watch 2 on several different multi-mile walks, using a manual counting app to log my steps. As I had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">come to find out previously</a>, the OnePlus Watch 2 and 3 are far closer to my manual counts than the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>One example is posted above but, on average, the OnePlus Watch 2 and 3 were usually within 30 steps of accuracy while the Pixel Watch 3 was typically counted around 150 extra steps.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 has more positive qualities than negative ones, no doubt, but that doesn't mean it's a perfect device. OnePlus addressed almost every single critique of last year's watch with this release, but it's actually the <em>lack</em> of features that adorn the list of cons for this year's watch — not missteps.</p><p>The biggest issue I have with the OnePlus Watch 3 is the physical size of the thing. I'm someone who prefers the smaller Pixel Watch model and even chose it when Google introduced a larger size model with the Pixel Watch 3. I already don't like the feeling of something on my wrist all the time, so when I wear a watch, I want it to disappear as much as possible. The OnePlus Watch 3 definitely <em>does not</em> do that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-google-pixel-watch-3" alt="Wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3 on separate arms to compare them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's great to have such a large display on my wrist, I find this large of a smartwatch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">a hindrance to activities like sleep tracking</a>. Maybe a different kind of band would help, but as it is, there were plenty of nights where sleep tracking was less than accurate because I wore the watch too loosely, a direct correlation to its size relative to my wrist.</p><p>Based on the number of absolutely huge smartwatches out there — plus the advent of the "ultra" form factor from some brands — I'm clearly an anomaly here. Still, imagine people with thinner wrists might not enjoy a big honkin' watch adorning them. Next year, I'd love to see OnePlus offer a smaller size, even if that means I get worse battery life.</p>

<p>Some people would also love an LTE connection if they want to take their watch hiking or swimming and want to leave their phone behind. Unfortunately, that's just not an option here, as the OnePlus Watch 3 only supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity.</p><p>And on the topic of "one size fits all," the OHealth app could use a few more customization options. I love the default data presented on the dashboard, but there's no way to customize it at all. You can't select different metrics to show, and you can't move the existing sections around at all despite having a long-press animation that seems to infer that this is a function.</p><p>I'd also love to see OnePlus start to incorporate some more advanced health-tracking features. Outdoor walks, runs, cycling, and other activities can plot step cadence, pace, and some other really interesting statistics but Fitbit is able to calculate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">the cardio load</a> to help you better balance fitness growth while managing recovery effectively.</p><p>It's effectively the difference between wearing a smartwatch to meet surface-level goals like step tracking and using a smartwatch's ample data to scientifically improve your health and fitness journey.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 is roughly the same price as its biggest competition — $300-$330, depending on when and where you buy it — yet offers at least one <em>fewer</em> OS update than those watches. The Google Pixel Watch 3 will see the end of its support around the same time as the OnePlus Watch 3 despite launching more than 6 months before it. If you're keeping track, that means these watches will see security updates through the end of 2027.</p><p>Considering my history with smartwatches, I think this is ample support time for a $300 smartwatch. OnePlus promises quarterly updates for its watch, which means you should get four updates per year, including four security patches and (presumably) one OS update. Samsung offers two additional years of updates for its watches but hasn't historically been very good at keeping up with these updates. In short, if you're worried about having a secure smartwatch in three years, you're just going to have to upgrade.</p><p>Outside of that, no ECG in North America is more than just a bummer; it's a huge missed opportunity for OnePlus in the world's largest smartwatch market.</p><p>The FDA requires that OnePlus pass a series of (expensive) tests in order to get ECG approval, which is why OnePlus didn't include the feature here. Elsewhere in the world, you'll be able to access this feature without issue. The latest Pixel Watches and Galaxy Watches all support ECG, so this is a major setback for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-new-health-lab-is-a-big-step-for-its-wellness-technology">OnePlus' fitness initiatives</a>.</p>

<p>Competition in the Wear OS space has dwindled as Samsung and Google have strengthened their chokehold over the market. If multi-day battery life is a must, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is the only real Wear OS 5 alternative. Even then, you'll <em>only</em> get a maximum of three days out of the Watch Ultra on a single charge.</p><p>If detailed health metrics or AI insights are important to you, both Samsung and Google do a great job in this area, but Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> pulls ahead with Fitbit-powered insights. It also supports ECG in North America, unlike the OnePlus Watch 3. The downside is that you'll have to pay Google $80 per year (or $10 a month if you don't want to commit) for this kind of data. For what it's worth, I don't think most people will find this level of data useful, but the ECG could be life-saving.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 offers three years of security updates and 3 OS updates, meaning it'll get Wear OS 8 before Google ends support. Samsung's Galaxy Watch 7 family will get an additional year of updates beyond that, making it the best choice for anyone who wants to hold on to their watch for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a beautiful watch with a bright, eye-friendly OLED display.</li><li>You want a watch that'll last most of the week on a single charge without sacrificing fitness features or app support.</li><li>You use your watch for a variety of exercises and physical activities and need one that's capable of tracking all of them accurately.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need LTE connectivity</li><li>You live in North America and want a watch with ECG support.</li><li>You like small smartwatches</li></ul>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 is the new best Wear OS smartwatch for anyone who likes big watches. It's got the best battery life among any Wear OS watch, including a secondary mode that'll triple the already excellent battery life if you don't mind reduced app support. Fitness tracking works impeccably well, meeting and beating my previous favorite, the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>OnePlus's OHealth app has improved to the point where I prefer its UI and features over rival apps. Data is kept and processed locally, and moving the watch between phones works exactly as you'd expect, meaning all your precious data moves with you when you upgrade phones. It even has some interesting and unique features, like an animated map after outdoor exercises and a short-form video scrolling remote if you pair it with a OnePlus phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>OnePlus can further improve the experience by adding a few more customization features to the OHealth app and giving customers more size and configuration options, but outside of those few requests, this is as good as Wear OS 5 gets.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-127">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google quietly ditched the Play Store’s app-sharing feature in a recent update.</li><li>The feature was supposed to be removed in a December update, but it oddly stuck around until now.</li><li>It was a lifesaver for users with little to no internet, allowing local app transfers without eating up data.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has pushed a sneaky Play Store update and, in the process, axed a feature most people might have never used: app sharing. While not widely known, it was a handy gem for some users.</p><p>Back in 2021, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/play-store-app-sharing-just-got-easier-googles-airdrop-alternative">introduced the app-sharing feature</a> that tied into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-samsungs-quick-share-feature">Quick Share</a>, making it a breeze to shoot apps directly between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. But, according to the fine print in the December Play Store update, this handy tool is now on its way out after three years of quietly doing its job.</p><p>This removal first came to light in December, when it looked like the Play Store’s v44.1 update would be the one to pull the plug. But, weirdly enough, the feature kept chugging along even after the update dropped. Fast forward to now, and the latest Play Store build has finally sealed the deal, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/09/google-play-share-apps/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, the app-sharing feature was a lifesaver in spots with spotty or nonexistent internet. Instead of eating up what little bandwidth was available, users could grab apps directly from nearby devices through local connections.</p><p>Back in the day, you could find the app-sharing feature tucked away in the Play Store’s 'Manage apps & devices' section, marked by a little 'Nearby Share' icon.</p><p>Google’s reason for axing app-sharing is a mystery. If you never knew it existed, you’re not alone. Safe to say, most people won’t even notice it’s gone.</p>
<h2 id="its-removal-is-a-big-loss-for-some-2">Its removal is a big loss for some</h2>
<p>Even though not many people used it, the feature was super handy for folks in spots with spotty or no internet. It gave them a way to get apps without relying on shaky connections. Now that it’s gone, it’s a real blow for anyone who depended on those local transfers to stay connected.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are still ways to get the job done. Plenty of third-party apps out there let you share data over Bluetooth. Sure, it’s not baked into the Play Store anymore, but the core idea lives on if you know where to look.</p><p>On top of that, Google’s own Nearby Share app is still up and running, letting you swap apps, photos, and other files between Android devices without needing an internet connection. And if that’s not your thing, there’s always Files by Google, which does pretty much the same thing.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Xiaomi is onto a winner with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">15 Ultra</a>; I used the phone for well over a month, and it is absolutely fantastic. There's a new design that makes it easier to hold and use, a bigger battery, the same great 1-inch main camera as last year but with a new 200MP tele lens that takes outstanding portraits alongside 4.3x zoom, and the latest available hardware. <br><br>Xiaomi debuted the device globally at Mobile World Congress, and the 15 Ultra is now making its way to India, where it is sold in a single 16GB/512GB model that costs ₹109,999 ($1,259). As always, Xiaomi India is incentivizing the launch by providing freebies — including the excellent photography kit that's bundled with all pre-orders. The phone is ₹10,000 costlier than the 14 Ultra in India, and that's understandable when you look at all the upgrades. <br><br>Even then, it is a considerable bargain when you consider the same phone is sold in the U.K. for £1,499 ($1,932), and other countries in the region for €1,499 ($1,627). Xiaomi has always been aggressive when it comes to India, and that's the case with the 15 Ultra as well, and if you're interested in the phone, India is the best country to pick it up. I'd argue that it's better to buy the 15 Ultra in India than China — even though it's more affordable in Xiaomi's home market — because the Indian model comes with the Play Store and all Google services out of the box.</p>

<p>Best of all, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra undercuts the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL in India. The Galaxy S25 Ultra costs ₹141,999 ($1,626) in the country for the 16GB/512GB edition, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> is ₹139,999 ($1,603) for the 512GB option. Although the 15 Ultra costs more than last year, it is still the best value (as it were) if you want a high-end phone in India, and there's also the fact that it has the absolute best camera package of any device today. <br><br>As I noted in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">Xiaomi 15 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> post, Xiaomi managed to deliver a better overall product than Samsung this year, and the icing on the cake is that the phone costs less in India. In every other region, the 15 Ultra is being sold at a premium over the S25 Ultra, so it's clear that Xiaomi is intent on gaining a foothold in the premium segment in India. <br><br>Xiaomi also debuted the regular Xiaomi 15 in India, and like last year, it does a good job going up against the likes of the OnePlus 13. Although Xiaomi does really well in the budget and now mid-range categories, it hasn't really made a dent in the high-end, and it will be aiming to change that with the 15 Ultra and Xiaomi 15.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Just a week ago, Samsung finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">expanded its One UI 7 beta</a> to phones outside of the Galaxy S24 series, which includes the Galaxy Z Flip 6. The update brings more or less the same changes that we’ve seen on Samsung’s phones, including an updated UI, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a>, and more. However, there’s one change in particular that caught my attention, and it feels like Samsung is taking the right steps toward improving the cover screen experience.</p><p>I’m talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">using apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>. This has always been a pain point for me with Samsung’s flip phones, as the company hides this function behind menus and severely limits the built-in functionality to allow just a handful of apps on the cover screen. That is unless you know how to download Good Lock and install the MultiStar module, which allows users to add a new panel with access to almost any app on their phone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4175px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-14.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4175" height="2348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem is that not everyone who picks up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is going to know this, and I’ve had to explain this process to a few people I’ve run into with the phone, who are always surprised to learn that they can do so much more on their external display. I feel like it’s a missed opportunity on Samsung’s part because there’s so much more screen to take advantage of.</p><p>With the One UI 7 beta, Samsung takes a small but important step toward remedying this. In the Labs menu, where you can enable cover screen apps, I noticed a large “Get MultiStar” button that sends users directly to the module in the Galaxy Store. Above the button is a short description that reads: “Download and install MultiStar to allow more apps on the cover screen.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:345px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:231.88%;"><img id="2bT2c5caKEfKAJP6KqQcGQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-Get-MultiStar-button" alt="A settings menu with various toggles and a large blue "Get MultiStar" button at the bottom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2bT2c5caKEfKAJP6KqQcGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="345" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The button will essentially bypass the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock app</a> and take users straight to the source. After it is installed, users can go to the Cover screen menu, where they can enable the Launcher widget under MultiStar. Alternatively, users can hit that same "Get MultiStar" button from before, which will take them straight to the Launcher editor, where they can select the apps they want on their cover screen.</p><p>The overall experience of using apps on the cover screen hasn’t really changed much, which is a little disappointing, given how One UI 7 has revamped so much of the overall user experience. For example, there’s still no way to multitask, you’ll actually need the app present on the Launcher for it to open via a notification, and you’ll still need to open the phone for certain tasks. It’s still an inferior experience to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which lets you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">use apps on the cover screen</a> out of the box and without going through hoops to make it happen.</p><p>That said, something as simple as adding a button can go a long way toward making more people aware of what the Galaxy Z Flip 6 can do without even opening the phone. Short of completely revamping the entire cover screen experience, this is the kind of awareness I’ve been hoping to see from Samsung.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="45qixYcw9UkSSQ7FVBCmLV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-leaked-render-3" alt="Leaked image of a blue Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45qixYcw9UkSSQ7FVBCmLV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are rumors that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will feature a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-shows-up-in-another-leak-with-starkly-familiar-camera-design">more expansive cover screen</a>, which could measure at least 3.6 inches or be as big as the one on the Razr Plus 2024. This is also a good sign that Samsung could be working towards rethinking its cover screen strategy from being completely panel-focused to giving users more freedom with the smaller display.</p><p>As much as I love the Motorola Razr, I really hope that Samsung takes this small change even further with the next major update and fully embraces cover screen apps without the need for the MultiStar app. This could make the upcoming flip phone battle between Motorola and Samsung much more interesting when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a> and Galaxy Z Flip 7 launch later this year.</p>

<ul><li>A subtle send button change has been spotted on Google Messages; it now darkens when you type, adding a bit of visual feedback.</li><li>Unread messages now stand out more, with bigger profile pictures making them easier to spot.</li><li>The heart reaction might soon be replaced with a thumbs-up when you double-tap on a message.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Messages just keeps rolling out new UI tweaks. After a busy stretch of updates, the company appears to be working on fresh changes.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-ui-changes-2-3533559/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has spotted a small but noticeable tweak in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>: the send button shifts to a darker shade once you start typing. It’s not a game-changer, but if you’re a regular user, you’ll probably pick up on it right away.</p><p>This under-the-radar tweak is meant to make typing feel a bit more responsive, especially for those who might struggle with visual cues. As for when it’ll hit everyone’s app is still up in the air.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.20%;"><img id="dq2Nn9qZumgBCg58L7tSs4" name="Google-Messages-send-button-dark" alt="Google Messages send button turning dark as you begin to type" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dq2Nn9qZumgBCg58L7tSs4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On top of that, there are a couple more tweaks in the mix. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1j7ouwf/why_are_some_profile_pictures_bigger/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> pointed out that profile pictures for unread messages are now bigger.</p><p>It looks like Google is trying to make unread chats stand out more than just slapping on bold text. This could be a handy visual cue if you’re skimming through a busy inbox.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1040px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.37%;"><img id="b33z83F3QeTsrAaMZKoSjF" name="Google-Messages-profile-pictures" alt="profile pictures are bigger for unread messages on Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b33z83F3QeTsrAaMZKoSjF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1040" height="503" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Affectionate_Mall_53 / Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, it looks like Google is tweaking the default double-tap gesture in Messages, as per a separate post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1j5vnmn/double_tap_now_thumbs_up_not_heart/?rdt=37455" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. Right now, it triggers a heart emoji, but word on the street is that the tech giant is swapping it out for a thumbs-up instead.</p><p>Prior to these, Google has been on a roll with tweaks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>. The company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-read-receipts-placement-redesign-spotted">fiddled with read receipts</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-search-ui-change-apk-teardown-3528033/" target="_blank">revamped the search bar</a>, and even spruced up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-animation-3530857/" target="_blank">how message bubbles look</a>. It also introduced a new animation for incoming texts.</p>

Out of everything OnePlus does, these four things help differentiate its phones from the pack, but CEO Pete Lau doesn't seem to agree.</p><p>The long-time OnePlus CEO said that the company will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-to-ditch-alert-slider-in-favor-of-new-button">replacing the alert slider</a> with an action button in an upcoming OnePlus phone, a move that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1734468772149854214?irclickid=VGL2ESXUZxyKR2fx4DXsTSE3Uks1lwwFr3x-U40&irgwc=1&utm_source=impact&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_content=Future%20PLC.&utm_term=ac-us&utm_campaign=12532">quickly angered fans</a> on the OnePlus Community forums. While this reaction is common among any fanbase when a long-time feature or function is changed, this time the overly negative response feels fully warranted.</p><p>The last time the company tried to mess with the alert slider was on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-10t-review">OnePlus 10T</a>. That phone debuted in August 2022 and completely removed the alert slider altogether. The response then was overwhelming, and a few short months later, in February 2023, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 11</a> prominently marketed the return of the alert slider to the cheering of the company's fans.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The simplicity of the alert slider is what makes it so perfect.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The alert slider has been so popular that OnePlus's sister company, OPPO, has outfitted several phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review" target="_blank">Oppo Find X8 Pro,</a> with one.</p><p>Lau's post talked about how great the alert slider has been over the years, but that praise was suffused with the idea that the alert slider was somehow "old" feeling and needed to be replaced with a newer, better idea. Thus, the company has considered swapping out the three-way slider — which is the easiest way to switch between silent, vibrate, and ring modes on any phone to date — with a programmable button.</p><p>The programmable button concept has become popular with phone makers since Apple launched its Action Button on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> in 2023. The most recent Android spin on the concept can be found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a> series, where Nothing made it function as an AI key for advanced screenshots and voice notes.</p><p>While Lau's idea of adding an action button is great — it's always nice to have more customizable options on complicated modern phones — the simplicity of the alert slider is what makes it so perfect. Replacing the alert slider is simply the wrong thing to do.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>OnePlus says it's listening to feedback and wants to hear your opinion. Now's the time to voice it!</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The alert slider makes it easy to know what sound mode your OnePlus phone is on with a simple glance. It's just as easy to switch between modes without ever having to turn on your screen or unlock the phone, and, for me, that's very important. I like my phone to make noise when I receive a notification. I miss notifications too easily otherwise, but it's not always appropriate for them to make noise.</p><p>While every phone has a silent or vibrate-only mode, no other modern phone makes it as easy to switch between these modes as OnePlus. This is a feature I use every single day, all throughout the day, and it's one of the reasons I use a OnePlus phone as my main device.</p><p>The silver lining is that while the OnePlus 13 Mini might see a release soon, the OnePlus 14 isn't expected until Q4 2025. That means there's potentially still time for OnePlus to reverse course before it makes a grave error. If you care about the alert slider and want to see it stick around, head to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1734468772149854214?irclickid=VGL2ESXUZxyKR2fx4DXsTSE3Uks1lwwFr3x-U40">the post on the OnePlus Community</a> and put your two cents in.</p><p>OnePlus, please don't replace the alert slider. We love it, and so do your fans. An action button is fine, but not in place of something that's already great. OnePlus has long been a brand "about the community" and says it's listening to feedback. This is the time to test that claim and see if it's true.</p>

Try re-loading." Android Central's staff also faced similar issues, with Nick Sutrich, who was unaware of the outage at the time and thought it could've been his network connection. He said, "I didn't even get an error, it just never loads sometimes."</p><p>According to DownDetector, 58% of users in the U.S. and 56% of folks in Canada continue to experience an outage with the app. If you see the graph below, there have been several points of peaking and equally low dips, indicating that the company is working hard to trace the source of this issue and possibly working on a fix.</p>

<p>At its peak, there were about 42,000 reports of the service being inaccessible, stated Downdetector.</p><p>After several hours, CEO Elon Musk took to the platform<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1899149509407473825"> to confirm </a>that X is under a "massive cyberattack," that could have caused the outage.</p><p>"We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources.

Unfortunately, neither phone comes with wireless charging, let alone the latest Qi2 wireless charging standard, as I was hoping. However, with the Nothing Phone 3 in the works, the company has an opportunity to make the ultimate Qi2 accessories of my dreams.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/qi2">Qi2</a> is one of those novel features that has been much harder for the industry to adopt. Even market-leading brands like Samsung have struggled with its implementation. So, it's not exactly shocking news that a budget company like Nothing decided to skip the magnetic wireless charging option altogether.</p><p>It's not like no phone from the brand has ever had wireless charging support. The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Nothing Phone 1</a> was one of the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a> to bring wireless charging to the sub-$500 segment. Following that release, the succeeding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> also supported 15W wireless charging. Unfortunately, the brand's cheaper "a" models forgo both Qi and Qi2 wireless charging options.</p>

<p>My expectations were super high with the new Nothing phones. Some might even say unreasonably high, but why shouldn't they be? Smartphones are extremely, outrageously, unapologetically fun these days. They can fold in halves and threes, survive rounds in the dishwasher, and even be transparent!</p><p>Nothing took a bold risk that paid off with its insanely cool see-through Android phones that come with LEDs baked into the back. It's this courage to try something unique, even if not entirely practical, that gave me hope to see Qi2 on an affordable, transparent Android phone.</p><p>Even if the Phone 3a and 3a Pro don't have Qi2, I'm still going to hold out hope for the Phone 3. Can you imagine how futuristic a magnetic transparent smartphone would look like? And don't even get me started on the accessories.</p><p>The brand does accessories really well, bringing that transparent, techy aesthetic to earbuds. More impressively, Nothing succeeded in creating a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">functional modular Android phone</a> where companies like Google previously failed. This shows promise.</p>

<p>According to an allegedly leaked email from the CEO of Nothing, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-leaked-memo">Phone 3 is rumored to launch</a> in the first quarter of this year. I'm shifting gears and turning my gaze towards the future. I can't wait to see what Carl Pei has in store for us.</p><p>A clear phone with lights encased in a glass back is unique enough — now picture a Qi2 coil incorporated into that blueprint. Nothing will probably do all that and still maintain the water and dust-proof integrity of the device. It's going to be an epic phone if it matches my imagination.</p><p>You can't have a see-through magnetic phone without companion accessories. I love anything MagSafe or Qi2, so my number one want from the brand is a transparent Qi2 power bank. Guess what? I'm not alone in my musings.</p>

<p>A user named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/4842-nothing-qi2-battery-pack-concept-battery-1/4">3DPrintedCat took to the Nothing Community forum</a> to share their mockup conceptual renders of what a Nothing Qi2 wireless power bank would look like. They decided to dub it the "Battery (1)," which is right on the money when it comes to Nothing's branding.</p><p>The product concept is sleek, minimal, and highly modern. The clean white ensemble and circular lights inside the Qi2 coil have me drooling. Flat metal sides look so flattering on power banks and battery packs. It's impressive how this fan-made "Battery (1)" concept is so in sync with Nothing's design language.</p>
<p>If Carl Pei does not deliver on such expectations, it's not just me who's going to be very let down. Clearly, many fans are also dying to see such an evolutionary product from Nothing.</p><p>The first quarter of 2025 is almost up, so if the rumors are true, we'll find out very soon whether the Nothing Phone 3 launch will meet our expectations or fail to deliver.</p>
