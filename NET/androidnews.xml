Since setting up a new phone can be overwhelming, these tips aim to help streamline the process by focusing on what you should change, enable, or disable first.</p><p>This is all in addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/things-do-after-setting-android-phone">first things you should do when setting up a new Android phone</a> (another article we recommend you check out). So let's get to it, shall we?</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-off-ram-boost"><span>Turn off RAM Boost</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YFjM2YR9A3nth53scB94gk" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-45" alt="Performance menu on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFjM2YR9A3nth53scB94gk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This goes first because this will require for you to restart your phone. While we generally don't care for virtual RAM features like RAM Boost, Motorola enables it by default on its phones. However, we find that you rarely ever need it (the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has 16GB of RAM, after all) and in some cases <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">it can make performance worse</a>.</p><p>We suggest turning this feature off as soon as you go through the initial setup. Navigate to <strong>Settings > System > Performance</strong>, where you'll find the <strong>RAM Boost</strong> option. Turn this off, and the phone will prompt you to restart the device for the change to take effect.</p><p>After you've done so, we recommend going back and enabling <strong>Smart app launch</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-and-adjust-display-colors"><span>Change and adjust display colors</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xLoh7rQLA7SGm7LL4n2nkC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-30" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xLoh7rQLA7SGm7LL4n2nkC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4068" height="2288" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola's displays have improved over the years, and the Razr 2025 series features some good-looking ones, especially with the Pantone Validated display on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>. One way to get the most out of your display is to ensure the colors are just as vibrant as you want them to be, and Motorola makes it easy to set this up.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Display > Colors</strong>, and you'll find a few options to choose from. These will change how the display presents colors. <strong>Natural</strong> is a more realistic representation, and while it appears more muted than the other two options, the colors here are optimized depending on the contents of your screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:327px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:244.65%;"><img id="FFdp5nyeHTyVF6brXVEGfY" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-display-color-settings" alt="Display color settings for the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFdp5nyeHTyVF6brXVEGfY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="327" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <strong>Radiant</strong> option is an in-between option for users who want a little pop but not too much. Colors are a bit more vibrant and saturated, but the difference isn't too dramatic compared to <strong>Natural</strong>.</p><p>Lastly, there's <strong>Vivid</strong>, which punches things up to the max and is for users who really like for their colors to pop.</p><p>However, in addition to these general settings, users can also adjust the color temperature using the color wheel at the bottom. There are <strong>Cool</strong> and <strong>Warm</strong> options at the bottom to make it easy, or you can go the <strong>Custom</strong> route and select from the wheel.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-control-center-style"><span>Change Control Center style</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3942px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jiucdiNVAh58YnF37zXVz" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-47" alt="Quick settings menu on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jiucdiNVAh58YnF37zXVz.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3942" height="2217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Android 14, Motorola has given users the option between two styles for the Control Center, the pulldown menu where quick settings toggles are found. By default, it goes with the Pixel-style Control Center, with large buttons and the notification center below it. However, you can change this to a more modern style if you want, something more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are adopting.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Home & lock screen > Control center</strong>. From here, tap <strong>Modern Style</strong>, which will switch to a two-panel control center, with Quick Settings on one side and notifications on the other. Each panel will take up the entire screen instead of sharing a screen, which means you'll be able to see more notifications or Quick Settings toggles by default.</p><p>If you tap the Settings cog, you can also set which side you want notifications and Quick Settings.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-disable-the-games-folder"><span>Disable the Games folder</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iNqYdsQjzg758FQNHkE2J3" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-46" alt="The Games folder on the Razr Ultra 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iNqYdsQjzg758FQNHkE2J3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2262" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola has done a great job minimizing bloatware on its phones, and normally this isn't something you have to deal with to an extreme on flagships. On the Razr series, the most glaring example of this is the Games folder in the app drawer, which is generated by default.</p><p>This wouldn't really be an issue, but the folder not only houses your games, but is basically a repository for ads in the form of game recommendations, courtesy of Motorola's Games app. Frankly, it's not for me, so the first thing I did was disable it, which is fairly easy.</p><p>In the app drawer, hit the three dots in the top right corner and navigate to <strong>Settings > Apps</strong>, where you'll find the option to toggle the Games folder off. Once you do, it disappears from your app drawer.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-cover-screen"><span>Set up the cover screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5GofuTebXUZBzxUpM527ub" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-26" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 with the Weather panel on the cover screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5GofuTebXUZBzxUpM527ub.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the best things about having a flip phone is the cover screen. It was great on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>, got better on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr series</a>, and continues to improve with the Razr 2025 (thanks to Android 15).</p><p>Setting up the cover screen on the Razr 2025 series is simple (it's about the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">as it was on the Razr Plus 2024</a>), although it'll take some work. With the phone open, navigate to <strong>Settings> External display</strong>, where you'll find all the most important settings for the cover screen. Go through each of these options to change your home and lock screens, adjust display and font size, change call behavior, and more.</p><p>We especially like the Music player, which sets a cool animated display when music is playing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G7AZhyMbZz5wwPtP8Sgp4C" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-08" alt="Widgets on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G7AZhyMbZz5wwPtP8Sgp4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing you won't be able to do from this menu is set your cover screen panels. For this, you need to close the phone. <strong>Tap and hold</strong> the cover screen home page (or <strong>pinch the display</strong> from any panel) and you'll find an overview of all your active panels. You can drag them around or tap <strong>Edit</strong> to add or delete panels.</p><p>Once you're done managing panels, navigate to your Apps panel and tap the <strong>pencil icon</strong> in the corner. Here, you'll be able to add apps and app shortcuts to the panel, and you can tap and hold to rearrange them once they're added. Go to the Widgets panel to do the same thing.</p><p>As a note, you can add up to three panels each for Apps and Widgets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FQksa84sZxrpW44LYMSQdB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-09" alt="Apps on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FQksa84sZxrpW44LYMSQdB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We recommend going back into the main External display menu to set your app behaviors, which will enable apps to transition between displays by default, manually, or never.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-moto-ai"><span>Set up Moto AI</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BMqJjBTVfREt8JUoCzNsnC" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-5" alt="Moto AI splash page on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BMqJjBTVfREt8JUoCzNsnC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After a brief beta phase, Moto AI is a big focus for the Razr 2025 series. It can seem overwhelming to some, especially since you already have Gemini and Perplexity preloaded onto the phone. However, you only have to interact with Moto AI as much as you want, and you can just let it fade into the background.</p><p>We have a whole <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI explainer</a> that we suggest you take a look at, which will go through the settings, capabilities, and more, so that you can get the most (or least) out of it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-trigger-moto-ai-with-the-ai-key-and-look-talk"><span>Trigger Moto AI with the AI Key and Look & Talk</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3890px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BdFpuBqFWpbE76gqdtgn3c" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-06" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen with Moto AI "Listening..."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BdFpuBqFWpbE76gqdtgn3c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3890" height="2188" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moto AI is here in full force, and while Motorola gives you quite a few ways to trigger it, there are two you'll want to enable off the bat (and you can forget about the rest, honestly). If you have the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, then you'll have access to both of these options.</p><p>The AI Key lets you activate Moto AI or specific Moto AI features depending on how you press it. Navigate to <strong>Settings > Gestures > AI Key</strong> to set the behaviors. For now, your options are limited to <strong>Press & Hold</strong> (to activate Moto AI) and <strong>Double Press</strong> (to activate Catch me up or Pay Attention).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 from the side showcasing the AI key." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Setting up Look & Talk is a little more involved. Navigate to <strong>Settings > Moto AI > Launch gestures > Look & Talk</strong>. To turn this feature on, you'll be prompted to enable Face Unlock on your phone. Tap <strong>Set up</strong> and follow the prompts to scan your face. Once that's done, Look & Talk should be enabled.</p><p>Now, once you set your Razr Ultra in Tent or Stand mode, it will begin searching for your face. Once you directly face it, Moto AI will trigger and you can start speaking to your phone.</p><p>Furthermore, you can go back into the Launch gestures menu to experiment with other gestures, but we suggest sticking to these two for Moto AI.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-other-gestures"><span>Set up other gestures</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iHoSFECxE5fL6jZuxa6WnD" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-3" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 cover screen with the camera viewfinder on." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iHoSFECxE5fL6jZuxa6WnD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the best things about owning a Motorola phone is all the cool and unique gestures you get. This includes chopping the phone twice to enable the flashlight and twisting the phone twice to turn on the camera (you'd be surprised how convenient these are).</p><p>Even better is that all of these features are found in one spot, so you can experiment with what works for you. Navigate to <strong>Settings > Gestures</strong> to check out all of the gesture options at your disposal. Here are some of my suggestions:</p>
<ul><li>[If you're using Gesture navigation] In <strong>System navigation</strong>, make sure Circle to Search is enabled. Then tap the settings cog in <strong>Gesture navigation</strong> to ensure Swipe for Assistant is toggled on for easy access to Gemini without using the wake word.</li><li>Enable the <strong>Sidebar</strong> for quick access to apps from nearly any screen.</li><li>For the <strong>Power Key</strong>, set the Press & hold option to Power Menu, as it will default to your digital assistant.</li><li>Enable <strong>Slide on power key</strong> for Quick Settings and notifications.</li><li>Enable <strong>Quick Launch</strong> and set it to open an app or function of your choice. For ease of use, I use this to take screenshots, as it's easier than the two-button or three-finger method. Set whatever tap strength you think is appropriate.</li><li>Ensure <strong>Quick Capture</strong> and <strong>Fast Flash</strong> are turned on.</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-and-adjust-camcorder-mode"><span>Set up and adjust Camcorder mode</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jeFoua6BCsNP9M7EbBz23B" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-14" alt="Camcorder mode splash page on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jeFoua6BCsNP9M7EbBz23B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola's Razr 2025 series takes advantage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> form factor with Camcorder mode, which lets you record videos by folding the phone at a 90-degree angle and holding it like you would a camcorder. You can even use the bottom half to zoom in and out easily using your thumb, making for a more stable video recording experience.</p><p>In the camera app, tap the icon at the top left, then hit <strong>Settings</strong>. Scroll down and tap <strong>Camcorder mode</strong>. Enable it and toggle on <strong>Auto recording</strong> if you want the phone to begin recording as soon as you flip the phone horizontally and fold it while the camera is on. You can also choose when to <strong>Start recording</strong>, either immediately or after a 3-second countdown.</p>

<p>Protection is essential, and smartphones have become vital parts of our lives. With phones like the Razr Ultra 2025 costing more than $1000, you'll definitely want to invest in some protection to keep it from breaking.</p><p>Thankfully, the nature of flip phones and the alternative materials Motorola utilizes means you don't have to worry about the pack panel or primary display breaking.</p><p>That said, the cover screen is very exposed, and you'll want to protect the phone as best you can from falls and other such incidents. Fortunately, we've compiled some useful collections of cases and screen protectors for each Razr 2025 model, which are definitely worth looking at.</p>

<p>Google finally showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> for the people who aren't trying a beta version of the upcoming OS, filled with UI changes and new animations.</p><p>There are reasons why this is smart and reasons why it might not be: it's polarizing, with many people already commenting about how they hate the changes. But it's also visual. You <em>can't</em> see the underlying change that allows for better network connections or safeguards against bad apps. You <em>can</em> see new colors, UI elements, and animations. Besides, a lot of people love them, too.</p>

<p>This year hits differently. There has been a lot of work on "morphing" the UI in a dynamic way; moving things around, rotating your phone, or opening more than one app on the screen all have a bit of special flair. You might love it or you might hate it, but it's there for everyone to see.</p><p>One thing that wasn't talked about a lot (yet) was a tablet. After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">Android Show</a>, Google's Dieter Bohn took a few minutes to show off some cool Android phones, but no tablets. Maybe Google has a lot more to say about them, but nothing worth putting front and center before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcementshttps://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">big developer conference</a> kicks off.</p>
<p>I do think we'll hear more about tablets during I/O, but I'm almost positive we're going to hear a lot more about foldables. Something tells me that Google thinks foldables have a real shot at (finally) being the mainstream device that will change the mobile tech landscape. And let's be honest — hearing <em>anything</em> that's not all about AI would be nice.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-Plus-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's hard for any company that makes Android devices to compete with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">Apple's iPad</a>. That's by design; Apple made sure there was a device to hit every price point, and they come in sizes to suit everyone. If you've ever used one, you know the iPad is a solid device.</p><p>Something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Galaxy Tab S</a> is also a solid device, but it lacks the traction of the iPad. No <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">flagship Android tablet</a> goes head-to-head with an iPad. I dunno why, but it is what it is. People buy Android tablets because they either need something cheap for the kids or because they're entrenched in Samsung's ecosystem of products.</p>
<p>You can not buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> that doesn't run Android. Dead stop. Some models from companies like Huawei aren't "official" but even if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huaweis-harmony-os-just-android-hat-and-sunglasses">name says something else</a> it's based on Android. That's because anyone can download the code and do whatever they want with it. Apple will get on board soonish and make a foldable, but for now, anyone interested in a phone that flips or folds open only sees Android.</p><p>Google has to take advantage of this. I know we see and hear things every year about "large-form-factor" or multi-screen devices, but I think Android 16 is going to be different, and more than just talk.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1077px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.86%;"><img id="sWw3XSx8DcXK7yyDjyAYpg" name="HarmonyOS-13-integration.jpg" alt="HarmonyOS 3 phone and tablet integration" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWw3XSx8DcXK7yyDjyAYpg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1077" height="537" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Foldables do stand a chance to change everything, too. Right now, there are two issues with the category: price and durability. You may love them (I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-havent-switched-phones-for-almost-a-year-and-i-love-it">Moto Razr is one of the best phones I've ever had</a>), but you can't deny they cost more and they're more fragile.</p><p>What I like to call the fragility factor gets better every year. You still have to have a plastic coating protecting an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-z-flips-ultra-thin-glass-may-not-be-glass-after-all" target="_blank">astonishingly thin layer of glass</a>, and any deep scratch is going to bust everything to hell, but that's the nature of the beast. Designs now incorporate protections for the display surfaces, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-glass-bend">hinges are stronger</a> and have less wiggle, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-display-crease-reduction-rumor">the ugly crease</a> is getting less prominent with every new release. A foldable will never be a tough phone you can use on a construction site, but they'll stand up to normal abuse a lot better than they used to.</p><p>Cost is also becoming less of a factor, albeit not as quickly as durability. Foldables, especially book-style devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review" target="_blank">Pixel Fold</a>, are expensive to design, full of expensive parts, and flat-out cost more. That's not going to change.</p><p>But consider this: you can buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook</a>, or you can buy a future version of the Galaxy Z Fold that almost replaces all three. Yes, you're reading that right: Jerry is saying that there's a chance foldables replace not only phones and tablets but laptops and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/ask-jerry-choosing-the-right-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, too. Call me crazy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Will that really happen? I dunno. You don't know either, and neither can Google or Samsung. But it <em>could</em> if the tech is built with this future in mind and the software makes a foldable something that "just works". Part of that is making it pleasant to use, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/material-3-expressive-is-return-to-form-pixel-watch-4-needs">seeing screen elements shape-shift</a> when you open a display, or being able to adjust multiple apps to size them appropriately on a single screen. You know, just like a laptop.</p><p>I'm not ready to call the death of the tablet and will never say the laptop can be replaced by a phone. But I don't build consumer electronics or write software for them. I just use what works best for me. If one day, a foldable is what works best because Google finally took the category more seriously, I'd save a lot of cash and buy that one magic device.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Galaxy S25 Edge just dropped</a>, and recent rumors suggest that it could replace the Plus in Samsung's upcoming flagship lineup. According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5262">The Elec</a>, Samsung is reportedly considering adding the S26 Edge to its next flagship series, potentially launching it in place of the Galaxy S26 Plus.</p><p>This aligns with the report's claim that Samsung has seen lower sales figures for its Plus models over the past few years. This trend could continue even with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a>, as Samsung is projected to ship only 6.7 million units of the Plus model.</p><p>It is important to note that the Galaxy S24 Plus also sold approximately 6.77 million units in its initial 11 months post-launch, a similar number to what they estimate for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. However, by the end of 2024, the Plus model's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/articles/galaxy-s24-plus-hit-im-195259486.html" target="_blank">sales shot up </a>by 54% compared to its predecessor, selling about 7.4 million units.</p><p>Despite this late and consistent rise in sales for the Plus variant, the device's performance has been lower when compared to the standard and Ultra models, which sold 13.6 million and 17.4 million units, respectively.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-vs-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-thickness-1" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's just speculation for now, so we should take it with a grain of salt. However, if it turns out to be true, Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, feels that swapping out the Plus variant could actually play in Samsung's favor.</p><p>"The Edge variant could potentially serve as an alternative to the Plus, but this also opens the door for Samsung to nudge a Plus consumer to buy up the stack and spend on an Ultra instead," he tells me.</p><p>That said, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> arrives with one major drawback — the company seems to have traded in battery life (3,900 mAh) for sleekness. That is something not many users will be happy about.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9BPRQASXSx2JKztWzsp97g" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-exclusive-samsung-colors-04" alt="The three Samsung.com exclusive colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9BPRQASXSx2JKztWzsp97g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From a consumer's perspective, a key factor when purchasing a phone is its battery life, minimizing the need to reach for your charger. A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://paylesspower.com/blog/battery-basics/">report</a> by Payless Power indicates that a significant majority, 59%, of Americans believe Android phones offer superior battery performance compared to iPhones, and 22% of consumers would even switch brands to obtain better battery life.</p><p>Considering the above, it seems unlikely that individuals would exchange a premium device featuring a substantial 4,900 mAh battery for one that seemingly compromises on battery capacity. Even though Samsung claims that the Galaxy S25 Edge can last an entire day with normal usage, that's just subjective to individual usage patterns.</p><p>According to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/14/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-report-replace/"> 9to5Google</a>, early reactions to the Galaxy S25 Edge have been largely focused on "questioning why the device exists, especially considering its very tiny battery compared to other flagships in Samsung’s lineup."</p>
<h2 id="galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus-2">Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Plus</h2>
<p>Historically, the Galaxy S-series Plus caters to people who prefer a larger display, with a focus on performance and battery life, as opposed to how light or sleek the phone is. These consumers are also less concerned with spending the exorbitant amounts that come with buying an Ultra with all its extra features.</p><p>In contrast, with the Galaxy S25 Edge, Samsung aimed to innovate in design, trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-17-air-5-key-rumored-features-from-an-ultra-thin-frame-to-so-so-battery-life">beat Apple to the punch</a> by creating a slimmer and lighter phone that delivers the same performance as a flagship device.</p><p>While the Galaxy S25 Edge may not have all the specs of the Plus variant, the two carry some similarities. Both have a premium build,  the same high-res AMOLED 6.7-inch display, the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite"> Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset,</a> both devices run on the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">One UI 7,</a> backed by Android 15, and come with similar AI capabilities.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>Samsung should go beyond just the battery and explore Qualcomm’s advancements in reducing power consumption</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani</p></blockquote></div>
<p>The sleek design of the Galaxy S25 Edge nudged the company to omit an additional telephoto lens, limiting its zoom capability and reducing its battery size. In essence, both these models are more alike than the other phones in the lineup, which could be why Samsung may be switching one for the other.</p><p>According to Ubrani, if Samsung intends to discontinue a middle-tier model, certain improvements are crucial for consumer adoption. However, addressing concerns about battery capacity could be a major priority, he feels that Samsung should go beyond just the battery and delve into "Qualcomm’s advancements in reducing power consumption," which could be a significant step.</p><p>Ubrani suggests that continuing the collaboration with Qualcomm, as seen in the Galaxy S25 series, might be "the primary way to improve battery life" for a streamlined device.</p>
<h2 id="will-the-edge-be-able-to-keep-up-with-the-plus-2">Will the Edge be able to keep up with the Plus?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Only time will tell.</p><p>While the Plus variant has a strong and steady fan base since its inception, it's hard to say whether or not this new Edge variant would be accepted by the audience at large.</p><p>For now, The Elec adds that "NPA (alleged codename for the Galaxy S26 lineup) is starting with standard, Edge, and Ultra models in mind, but may change Edge back to Plus if Galaxy S25 Edge doesn’t perform well."</p><p>That said, if Samsung does indeed decide to ditch its Plus model, due to the lag in sales when compared to the other two variants, it might be a logical decision when it comes to generating revenue. Additionally, Samsung has featured a consistent lineup for years, with the standard, Plus, and Ultra models. This move could also indicate a potential shift in the company's strategy to cater to evolving consumer preferences, which could come as a refreshing change.</p><p>"Assuming all goes well and the Edge costs more than the Plus, then this could lead to greater revenue for Samsung as users transition to the Edge or Ultra," Ubrani adds.</p>

It revealed some of the significant developments much earlier than expected, giving users a full look at what's in store with Gemini, Material 3 Expressive, and its updated safety and privacy tools.</p><p>First up, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show">Gemini comes to more devices</a>. Gemini is expanding across the Android ecosystem, replacing Google Assistant on phones and integrating into Wear OS, cars, TVs, and XR.</p><p>This integration focuses on providing more intuitive, hands-free, and context-aware AI assistance across various devices. "Like when your hands are covered in flour while cooking, when you’re rushing between meetings, or when you’re in the middle of a bike ride," Google explained in the press release.</p><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>, Google is modifying its UI experience to be more expressive and interactive with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. Google explains that M3 Expressive is all about design that feels good, makes sense, and helps you do things with ease. It leans on five key components, such as color, shape, size, motion, and containment, to steer the user's attention to the stuff that matters.</p><p>Wear OS 6 is also getting a fresh coat of paint, more customization via color options, and a customizable UI. Watch faces will now be able to change the whole color of the OS, giving the wearable a more thematic feel.</p>

These messages will be automatically flagged and filtered as spam if spam detection is enabled.</p><p>Google's Find My Device will also evolve into Find Hub with UWB tag support and satellite connectivity for enhanced tracking. The tech giant will partner with airlines to simplify lost luggage recovery using Bluetooth tag location sharing.</p>

Bringing back the HBO name is a key move in Warner Bros. Discovery, in its plan to grow a global customer base and keep up with other streaming giants.</p><p>The company believes that reintroducing the HBO brand on Max will make things more seamless for customers as to the kind of content they can expect to see.</p>

Pei announced that the Phone 3 will launch this summer. Pei states the company is "going all in" with the device, granting it "premium materials, major performance upgrades, and software that levels things up."</p><p>More importantly, Pei all but confirmed to consumers its price, reportedly "somewhere around" £800 (~$1,062).</p><p>Pei adds that users will be given the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-show-io-2025-security-privacy-details">secure</a>" and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">upgraded Android experience</a> within the upcoming Nothing Phone. The video then gets into Nothing's AI efforts, considering they had to postpone the launch of the device last year. Pei states the company has worked with its community to create software that's "not just bolted on, but built in."</p>

It snuck in a quick announcement about the wearable at the end of the Galaxy S25 Edge's press release — something extra for wearable fans.</p><p>According to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=53591&u1=ac-ca-4481943900485838052&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.samsung.com%2Fkr%2F%25ec%2582%25bc%25ec%2584%25b1%25ec%25a0%2584%25ec%259e%2590-%25ea%25b0%25a4%25eb%259f%25ad%25ec%258b%259c-s25-%25ec%2597%25a3%25ec%25a7%2580-%25ea%25b3%25b5%25ea%25b0%259c" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Korean website</a>, the new Galaxy Ring is pretty much the same tech-wise as its past versions/ Samsung calls it "Two-Tone Titanium Black," a smooth mix of the classic Titanium Black and Titanium Silver. We weren't able to spot any images of this exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> yet, but it's clear the company is going for a premium vibe here.</p><p>For now, this color is only for the South Korean audience, and it remains unclear whether it will be available on this side of the globe.</p>

<p>The OntheGo 3-in-1 Qi 2 charger is interesting, because it lets you charge a phone, smartwatch, and earbuds all at the same time. The 3-in-1 charger is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-OntheGoTM-Wireless-Portable-Charging/dp/B0F49KPL7T">retailing on Amazon for $99</a>, and there's also a 2-in-1 option <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-OntheGoTM-Wireless-Portable-Charging/dp/B0F4B9ZYMK">that's available for $79</a>. Both variants are sold in three color options — black, desert rose, and sand — and they include 15W Qi 2 charging as standard.</p>

<p>I got the 3-in-1 charger in black and the 2-in-1 variant in sand, and what immediately stood out with these chargers is the design. I tested several Qi 2 charging mats — most recently the Native Union Voyage — and the OntheGo models have a better design and build quality thanks to the vegan leather construction.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="bUuZXMXsNAid346QiVbE5B" name="Satechi OntheGo 3-in-1 Qi 2 Travel Charger" alt="Satechi OntheGo 3-in-1 Qi 2 Travel Charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bUuZXMXsNAid346QiVbE5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The foldable design ensures they're easy to stash into a bag, and they don't weigh much at all — the 3-in-1 model comes in at 145.3g, and the 2-in-1 option is 104.5g. Satechi bundles a USB-C to USB-C cable in the package, and it is color-matched to the charger, which is a nice touch. Another positive is the carrying bag — Satechi includes a cloth bag with either product.</p>

<p>The build quality is fabulous, and I didn't see any issues in the two weeks I used the products. The leather design feels great, and both chargers include strong magnets. You'll need to use a 36W USB PD wall charger to make the most of the OntheGo 3-in-1, and Satechi recommends a 30W charger with the OntheGo 2-in-1.</p>

<p>There isn't a wall charger bundled with the package, so you will need to use your own — we've rounded up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gan-chargers">best GaN chargers</a> if you're interested in something that's just as easy to travel with as these Satechi chargers. I connected both products to my Nexode 200W charging station, and didn't see any problems in this regard.</p>

<p>The OntheGo 3-in-1 goes up to 25W; it has 15W Qi 2 charging, 5W to charge any earbuds, and 5W for the Apple Watch. The charger unfurls to reveal three charging pads, with the leftmost (the one with the Satechi logo) featuring Qi 2 integration. The earbuds mat is marked accordingly, and smartwatch module raises up to enable Nightstand Mode.</p>

<p>I used it to charge my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro, and it did a terrific job charging all three devices. What's interesting is that you get StandBy mode as well if you angle the charger, and it's convenient if you want to access a calendar, clock, or view your photos while your iPhone is charging.</p>

<p>You can also use the charger with Android phones, but you'll ideally need a MagSafe case with a strong magnet. I tested it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo X100 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and it did a decent enough job. The OntheGo 2-in-1 is also just as good in its own right, but you miss out on the ability to charge earbuds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5159px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8mY5jUYJPGhkE36SxcAs2B" name="Satechi OntheGo 3-in-1 Qi 2 Travel Charger" alt="Satechi OntheGo 3-in-1 Qi 2 Travel Charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8mY5jUYJPGhkE36SxcAs2B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5159" height="2906" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having used both extensively, I recommend the OntheGo 3-in-1; it is a little bulkier than its 2-in-1 sibling, but you get added versatility, and it doesn't cost much more. Regardless of whichever model you go with, you're getting a terrific travel Qi 2 charger.</p>

<ul><li>Users on the Pixel Phones subreddit report incredibly shortened battery lives following the May patch.</li><li>Reports say their Pixel phone is only managing roughly three-and-a-half hours of battery life, which isn't the norm.</li><li>Throwing a wrench into things are reports from others that say the May update has aided their batteries.</li><li>A similar issue happened in March where some Pixels suffered brightness problems, audio, and vibration issues, which were patched out in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's Pixel issues after a monthly security patch reportedly continue, as users bring their voices together online.</p><p>There's a lengthy thread on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1kn6373/what_happened_to_pixel/">Pixel Phone subreddit</a> where users are reporting a severe hit to their device's battery life after the latest security update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/05/pixel-battery-life-takes-a-nosedive-after-may-update-say-frustrated-users.html">Android Headlines</a>). The original poster (OP) put up a screenshot of their Pixel's battery usage which showed their Wi-Fi connectivity sucked up 100% in three hours. While the user acknowledges this could be a (strange) bug, the root of the issue is that their device only lasted three hours.</p><p>It seems as though this problem — the battery drain, specifically — is the result of the May security update.</p><p>More users chimed in about their experiences following the May patch. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1kn6373/comment/msfmluv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">post states</a> their Pixel 8 Pro only survives for roughly three-and-a-half hours on a full charge. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1kn6373/comment/msgabw1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">report</a> referenced a user's Pixel 7, which also took "a huge hit." While some of these reports concern older Pixel phones, there were a few that brought up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 9a</a> and even the Pixel 9 Pro Fold after the May update, each suffering shorter power spans.</p><p>What's strange is that these tanked battery issues aren't affecting everyone. Some say Google's recent update has <em>improved </em>their battery lives.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-topsy-turvy-2">A little Topsy-Turvy</h2>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1kn6373/what_happened_to_pixel">What happened to Pixel?😭😂</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones">r/pixel_phones</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Without a clear-cut cause, it's hard to determine what's at fault. However, with some users clearly affected, Google might have to take another look a deliver an update as quickly as possible.</p><p>This isn't the first time Pixel users have suffered problems in recent history, as, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">following the March patch</a>, devices were acting strangely. Users reported brightness fluctuations, audio problems, and vibration issues. The brightness issue seemingly only occurred when users attempted to watch shows or movies via a streaming app like Prime Video. There were band-aid fixes, but those were, as the name implies, temporary.</p><p>Those with Pixels that were affected had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">wait until April</a> before Google patched them. A similar approach might happen again this time for people with these battery problems.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-may-2025-pixel-update-is-here">rolled out its May patch</a> ten days ago, and its changelog didn't mention any "fixes" for batteries. So, it's not like we can call that out as the culprit of the conflict. What the update did was solve a critical zero-day Android flaw. Elsewhere, Google patched Bluetooth, microphone quality when recording, and Framework issues.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing Phone 3 rumors surface after a couple of database appearances, stating the device could rock Qualcomm's flagship chip, like the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</li><li>The Phone 3 could also see a battery that around 5,000mAh or higher, and with a few upgrades to its telephoto and periscope cameras.</li><li>Nothing's CEO Carl Pei announced this week that the Phone 3 will launch this summer with a price tag around £800 (~$1,062).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Quickly after Nothing built hype over its next flagship, a recent discovery is reportedly highlighting its upgrades.</p><p>Reported by Yogesh Brar at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/the-wait-is-almost-over-exclusive-scoop-on-nothings-flagship-phone-3/">SmartPrix</a>, the Nothing Phone 3 (codename "A024") has reportedly appeared in the GSM database. What's more, the tipster's sources claim that the device will seek to stand firm on flagship grounds by sporting Qualcomm's "flagship snapdragon" SoC. This seemingly points toward the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, which debuted last fall.</p><p>Another internal change is rumored to regard the Phone 3's battery. According to Brar, Nothing could pack a 5,000mAh or higher battery inside its upcoming flagship.</p><p>The post concludes with an external rumor, suggesting the device could see a "versatile" triple camera system. The primary sensor is expected to be "large," but no other details were stated. However, the most notable upgrade could hit the phone's periscope and telephoto lenses.</p><p>Again, nothing more was stated about how high we should set our bar. Brar adds that the device also suddenly appeared in the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) database. This is pushing speculation to believe the device is right around the corner, which lines up with what Nothing CEO Carl Pei teased.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the tipster likens the Phone 3 rumored battery increase to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and 3a Pro</a>. Both devices sport an exact 5,000mAh battery with 50W fast charging. What's worth remembering here is that these devices walk the affordable line. It's a truly decent battery size, but rumors suggest the flagship Phone 3 could expand on this. It makes sense, given how Nothing's been hyping it up.</p><p>Moreover, the Phone 3a Pro features a 50MP primary lens and a 50MP Sony LTY-600 periscope lens (with an 8MP ultrawide). These could be the specs we're looking at once the Phone 3 is revealed, but we'll have to wait to know more.</p><p>Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-summer-price-confirmed">announcement</a> earlier this week confirmed the Phone 3's launch for 2025, and stated it would happen this summer. It's CEO, Carl Pei, stated the device would pack Android OS with its upgraded features and security parameters once it arrives. Additionally, Pei stated Nothing was going "all in" with the Phone 3 to make it a true flagship.</p><p>With that, the teaser stopped, but not before Pei stated the device would cost somewhere around £800 (~$1,062). News about the phone's arrival is welcome, especially after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">Nothing delayed it in 2024</a> for the sake of AI.</p>

Garmin only discounted it $25 during Black Friday and kept it full price otherwise. To see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-f%C4%93nix%C2%AE-Multisport-Long-Lasting-Built/dp/B0DC6ZD31R"><strong>Fenix 8 at $799 and up, or $200 off</strong></a>, is truly a rare opportunity and an all-time low.</p><p>Among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/amazon-quietly-drops-huge-sale-on-garmin-smartwatches-here-are-the-5-deals-that-matter"><strong>excellent Memorial Day Garmin deals</strong></a> on Venu, Forerunner, Instinct, and Lily models, the Fenix 8 is still <em>quite</em> expensive at this deal price. But my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8 review</a> breaks down how it takes all of the best features from Garmin's running, lifestyle, and battery watches and squeezes them into one epic package.</p><p>All of the Fenix 8 AMOLED models (43mm, 47mm, and 51mm) are $200 off, but many of them are starting to sell out on Amazon. I'd either move quickly or look at other retailers like Best Buy and REI, which have the same deal pricing.</p>

The Garmin Fenix 8 makes a serious case for it, and at $200 off for Memorial Day, it's a slightly easier decision.</p><p>Depending on the model, the Fenix 8 AMOLED has up to 29 days of battery life or 62 multi-band GPS hours, crushing the competition. It has built-in city, trail, golf, and ski maps so you can navigate without pre-downloading a course, and a mic & speaker for Bluetooth calling and an offline assistant for commands like "Start a Trail Run workout."</p><p>It's dive-certified with 10ATM resistance to handle extreme water sports, with a built-in flashlight for nighttime runs to signal your presence to cyclists. And it has the full range of Garmin software that the company price-locks from cheaper watches.</p><p><strong>Other sites: </strong><a href="https://www.rei.com/product/245469/garmin-fenix-8-amoled-sapphire?sku=2454690005" data-dimension112="8d1f632a-2a7e-4bf2-8866-8d2a4997edcb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other sites: REI - $899" data-dimension48="Other sites: REI - $899" data-dimension25="$799">REI - $899</a> | <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-fenix-8-amoled-sapphire-gps-smartwatch-43mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-soft-gold/6594300.p?skuId=6594300">Best Buy - $899</a> | <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1228429/pn/010-02904-20/">Garmin - $899</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-f%C4%93nix%C2%AE-Multisport-Long-Lasting-Built/dp/B0DC6ZD321" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8d1f632a-2a7e-4bf2-8866-8d2a4997edcb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other sites: REI - $899" data-dimension48="Other sites: REI - $899" data-dimension25="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The cheaper models use stainless steel, but you can pay $100 extra for a lighter titanium case and sapphire crystal. You can also choose the Fenix 8 Solar for months of sunlight-boosted battery life, but we recommend the AMOLED for the best visuals.</p><p>The Fenix E is even more affordable at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-f%C4%93nix%C2%AE-Multisport-Long-Lasting-Built/dp/B0DD5RD79L"><strong>$599 ($200 off)</strong></a>, but be warned that this model cuts most of the core features like the flashlight, mic & speaker, new gen5 HR sensor with ECG and skin temperature, multi-band GPS, and diving protection.</p>

<p>Among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a>, the Fenix 8 has no equal, and we're not likely to see a Fenix 9 for years. And since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">Garmin watch prices are going up</a> to combat tariffs, the Fenix 8 at this price is a rare commodity.</p><p>Case in point, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-and-570-revealed-all-key-upgrades">Forerunner 970</a> costs $749, and while we're excited to test it out, the Fenix 8 at $799 barely costs more while giving you much better battery life and a more durable design.</p><p>It can be hard to recommend the Fenix 8 at full price, but thanks to Memorial Day, it's fallen into more reasonable territory, in the same range as the $799 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> or $650 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.

<ul><li>Spotify announces its AI DJ is now capable of taking vocal song requests on mobile for Premium users.</li><li>Users can press-and-hold its icon to speak a request that includes/combines various music aspects like genre, mood, artist, or songs for an activity.</li><li>Spotify says this is rolling out for users in more than 60 countries today (May 16).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Spotify is busy rolling out an update for its AI DJ that lets users unlock more of its potential for a real-time discovery experience.</p><p>In a press release, Spotify stated it's making good on a user-requested feature by adding more interactions with its AI DJ. For English Premium users in over 60 countries, Spotify says users can control the DJ with their voices for increased personalization. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-13/dj-voice-requests/">follow-up post</a>, the platform states users can "update their personalized sessions" by telling the DJ what they want to hear, rather than letting it go on its own.</p><p>To get this started, Spotify Premium users can search for the DJ and hit play.  When you want to change up the DJ's style, Spotify states you will need to press and hold its icon on the bottom right of your phone. This activates the ability for users to fine-tune the DJ to their preference. Users can tell the DJ to play a specific artist, genre, mood, or music to help them get through an activity, like running.</p><p>Additionally, Spotify says its DJ can understand requests about these areas in combination. The post gives the following example: "Give me some electronic beats for a midday run.”</p><p>Spotify's DJ still pulls from your listening history and preferences to guess what you'd enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="requesting-2">Requesting...</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Pp9bCfR7mCPrY9b7k5ot9R" name="spotify-dj-song-request-example" alt="Users can search for Spotify's AI DJ and press and hold its icon to deliver a description of what they'd like to hear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pp9bCfR7mCPrY9b7k5ot9R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the DJ's press-and-hold option is rolling out, Spotify reminds users that you still retain the "skip" function, which encourages the AI to rethink its vibe.</p><p>The AI DJ's song request feature is arriving slowly to users beginning today (May 16); however, Spotify warns that it's still in beta. The DJ could get things wrong or even give you a podcast instead of a song.</p><p>We've had Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-ai-dj-curated-music">AI DJ for two years now</a>, after it debuted with OpenAI technology alongside the platform's music experts. The feature has remained consistent, leveraging users' listening history and genre preferences to understand and produce songs that they know. The DJ has also continued to suggest songs that users may like, using all of their history as a base.</p><p>Sometimes it gets things wrong, and that's where the skip button comes into play.</p><p>At its core, the DJ's purpose was to facilitate easier, quicker real-time curation of music. With the inclusion of voice descriptions for users, the process speeds up, while also becoming a little more specific based on your tastes.</p>

<p>I've always been intrigued by the idea of going back to the days when I didn't need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> and could just rely on my phone or laptop for everything. Unintentionally, I performed this little experiment after my smartwatch ran out of juice and I couldn't find the charging cable.</p><p>Side note: that's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-charging-is-an-unsolvable-mess">different issue</a> entirely, and one that we've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-rabbit-just-ate-my-pixel-watch-charging-cord-and-now-im-screwed">written about</a> numerous times.</p><p>I really didn't intend for this experiment to take place; I just couldn't find the right cable at the end of the day, and just wanted to go to bed. Then, I woke up the next morning and didn't even think about the fact that I wasn't wearing a watch — at least at first. It wasn't until the day progressed that I opened my phone to find quite a few missed notifications.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6vK9MH3VxuccFPa6VrwzRa" name="Tangled-chargers.jpeg" alt="Charging cables for the Apple Watch, Amazfit Band 7, Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, Fitbit Sense, Amazfit GTS 2, COROS APEX 2, and Garmin Forerunner 955." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6vK9MH3VxuccFPa6VrwzRa.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of trying to find the charging cable, I got sidetracked by something else, which happens more often than I'd like to admit. Fast forward to today, and it's been 10 days since my smartwatch served its most recent notification.</p><p>When the idea about going smartwatch-less first struck, I didn't think I'd be able to go for more than a day before needing to put it back on. At the same time, I was kind of hoping that not having my wrist constantly buzz at me all day and night would give me some type of peace and quiet.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's been quite the opposite.</p>

<p>The annoyance of nonstop notifications has been replaced with dread and anxiety about what I might have missed. Not so much with things like the trivial notifications that I get throughout the day, but more so with messages from my wife, work, and one app that lets me know when my son is waking up from a nap.</p><p>Yes, all of those notifications still come through and buzz my phone, but I don't always have my phone in my pocket. Most of the time, it's sitting on my desk, with a million other devices that are buzzing or beeping as they vie for my attention. This could have also been partially remedied by using something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/phone-link-is-looking-more-like-windows-answer-to-apples-airdrop">Phone Link</a>, but due to ongoing issues with my desktop computer, it's not currently set up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="y2tkQisSDBpXAjYKacNLWY" name="microsoft-link-to-windows-app-on-lenovo-keyboard.jpg" alt="Microsoft Link to Windows app on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2tkQisSDBpXAjYKacNLWY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A lot of notifications are like junk mail that just get swiped away or ignored. However, I've come across a couple of times when an important message would buzz me, only to get buried by subsequent "junk" notifications.</p><p>Or, I would just be in the middle of working on something, only to see that my wife is calling me because she needs an answer to something, and I wasn't responding. For reference, phone calls give me instant anxiety, so people only call me if they <em>really</em> need something or it's an emergency.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-ve-missed-2">What I've missed</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sdWqNt9qG8her2wPHaWvTc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-google-home-unlocking-front-door.jpg" alt="Unlocking the front door with the Google Home app on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sdWqNt9qG8her2wPHaWvTc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is one aspect of wearing a smartwatch that I miss, and it's being able to do things from my wrist. Sometimes that's just sending a quick reply to a message, but it's mostly controlling various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-one-app-has-made-my-life-so-much-easier">smart home</a> accessories.</p><p>I've mentioned this before, but it's rather difficult trying to turn off smart lights when you have an infant in your arms. Compounding this issue is trying to do that without just using my voice, as it's deep enough that my son will wake up from the deepest slumber. That alone is kind of crazy to think about, but that's not a topic for here.</p>
<h2 id="glanceable-health-tracking-is-convenient-2">Glanceable health tracking is convenient</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bCMGrpnKCjBAcgffmGH24b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-blood-oxygen.jpeg" alt="Blood oxygen monitoring on the Galaxy Watch 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCMGrpnKCjBAcgffmGH24b.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other side of everything is that I've gone 10 days without tracking my sleep or being notified if my heart rate is too high. Those matter more to me than tracking steps or workouts because, well, I don't work out unless you count chasing a little one around.</p><p>The former is because knowing how long I slept provides direct correlation for why I might be feeling like crap. So if I get five or more hours of sleep (which is better than normal) and wake up feeling off, it's an indication that I should probably keep an eye on how I'm feeling throughout the day. The latter is due to my having high blood pressure, and I don't always pay close enough attention to know when to take a break from something to get up and walk around.</p><p>(<em>Editor's note: Keep in mind that while these metrics are helpful, your smartwatch cannot diagnose health conditions and</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/when-it-comes-to-your-health-dont-place-too-much-trust-in-your-smartwatch"><em> should always consult your doctor</em></a><em> if you are concerned with any readings from your smartwatch.</em>)</p>

<p>It's weird and honestly a little unsettling to look in the app on my phone and see absolutely no data populated. But that's mostly thanks to how long it's been since I've gone this long without some type of smartwatch or fitness tracker on my wrist.</p><p>If it weren't for my issues revolving around notifications, I would probably just pick up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> and wear a "traditional" watch when the occasion arose. As it turns out, that's just not something that's viable for me currently, so if you'll excuse me, I need to figure out where I put that dang charger.</p>

<hr>
<p>Xiaomi is rolling out its own smartphone chip called the XRING 01, signaling the company's growing intention to build more of its phone tech from the ground up and pushing hard to stay ahead of the race.</p><p>The company's co-founder, Lei Jun, took to Weibo to drop the name of Xiaomi's first in-house smartphone chip. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/chinas-xiaomi-launch-self-developed-mobile-chip-late-may-2025-05-15/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, he also confirmed the chip will make its debut in a device before the end of May.</p><p>Breaking from the usual playbook, Xiaomi’s XRING 01 chip is reportedly built on TSMC’s 4nm tech, the same stuff powering today’s top-tier chips from Qualcomm and MediaTek.</p>
<h2 id="beastly-cpu-setup-2">Beastly CPU setup</h2>
<p>Under the hood, it’s said to rock an octa-core setup in a 1+3+4 layout: a Cortex-X925 core at 3.2GHz, three Cortex-A725s running at 2.6GHz, and four Cortex-A520s cruising at 2.0GHz.</p><p>As per industry tipster Digital Chat Station, Xiaomi’s in-house chip is blowing past expectations. Early benchmarks are looking solid, and if the hype holds up, it might even edge out the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in raw performance.</p><p>Wary of possible U.S. sanctions, Xiaomi has set up a 1,000-strong task force led by ex-Qualcomm exec Qin Muyun, who came on board back in 2021. The team’s mission is to build out the XRING 01, Xiaomi’s custom application processor, which first popped up as a prototype earlier this year.</p><p>Xiaomi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-chip-platform-department-creation-report">has an in-house team that’s been quietly grinding away on custom chips</a> for a while now. The team works to make sure the processors and other key parts are dialed in for Xiaomi’s phones.</p>
<h2 id="xiaomi-15s-pro-likely-first-to-get-it-2">Xiaomi 15S Pro likely first to get it</h2>
<p>Rumor has it that the Xiaomi 15S Pro will be the first to pack the new XRING 01 chip under the hood. Since the 15 and 15 Ultra are already out in the wild, the 15S lineup looks like Xiaomi’s clever move to spice up the lineup halfway through the cycle.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the XRING 01 isn’t Xiaomi’s first shot at custom chips. Back in 2017, it rolled out the Surge S1 for the Mi 5C. The company even started cooking up the Surge S2 after that but decided to hit pause on its in-house chip plans—until now.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>YouTube is rolling out a fresh way to vote songs up or down in shared playlists.</li><li>Once invited, your crew can thumbs up tracks, pushing favorites to the front.</li><li>You control who gets to vote—open it up to everyone, keep it exclusive to collaborators, or switch voting off.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube has unveiled a fresh feature for collaborative playlists that lets you give songs a thumbs up or down to show what’s hitting or missing.</p><p>This new feature could make road trips and kickbacks way more fun. According to a post on X, YouTube is turning on playlist voting, letting everyone have a say (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-collaborative-playlist-voting-added/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). It's slowly rolling out in phases.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📣 We’re introducing even more updates to playlists! Now we’re gradually rolling out voting on playlistsYou can try this out yourself by voting for your favorite song on this playlist we made from Kendrick Lamar & SZA’s “The Grand National” Tour setlist: https://t.co/JEoSoEfoxX https://t.co/gCES0MxQfS<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1922756235037667431">May 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>For the uninitiated, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube</a> has had shared playlists for a while now, where multiple people can add songs and build one big mix together. It’s perfect for parties, hangouts, or anytime you want a group vibe.</p><p>Now, YouTube is letting friends or family in a shared playlist vote on songs. If you’re invited, you can jump into the app and give tracks a thumbs up or thumbs down. Songs with more love move up in the queue, so the crowd favorites play first.</p><p>YouTube has posted a Shorts video showing you how to let your squad vote on tracks.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbH6OTkBRPw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<h2 id="how-to-set-it-up-2">How to set it up</h2>
<p>If you want to try it out, just start by making a new playlist and set it to “unlisted” or “public.” Then flip on the “collaborate” option, hit the share icon, copy the link, and send it to whoever you want to join in.</p><p>When it comes to voting control, you can open it up to ‘Everyone’ with a YouTube account, shut voting off completely, or let only invited collaborators cast their votes.</p><p>Like with any group-driven feature, there are some hiccups to keep in mind. It’s awesome for getting everyone pumped before a road trip or hangout, but if people don’t actually vote, you might still be stuck picking songs yourself.</p><p>Also, make sure you load up on a good variety of tracks early on. Otherwise, the playlist can get a bit messy before the voting sorts things out.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Silicon-carbon batteries are gaining significant momentum, with all Chinese brands utilizing the tech in their 2025 flagships. It's easy to see why manufacturers are rushing to use these batteries in their phones; switching to silicon provides better energy density — allowing brands to squeeze in bigger batteries — alongside increased durability, and it holds up much better in cold weather.</p>

<p>That's why the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> have considerably bigger batteries than their predecessors without adding too much bulk or weight. These batteries still use a lithium cathode, but the anode sees a mixture of silicon-carbon alongside the usual graphite, and this results in greater density.</p><p>Group14 is at the front lines of this push, with the brand's SCC55 silicon-carbon composite used widely in the industry — Honor's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">Magic 7 Pro uses the custom material</a> in its battery, for example. Group14 is now partnering with German industrial giant BASF to deliver a "drop-in-ready solution" that predominantly uses silicon-dominant anodes.</p><p>Group14 says this move has the potential to unlock a whole host of new use cases, and I talked to the brand's VP of Global Market Strategy, Grant Ray, to get a better understanding of the tech. "The collaboration with BASF is about working with a leading global partner to develop drop-in solutions that shift the way we think about battery performance."</p><p>"BASF is coming up with interesting technologies, and we've been working closely together create a turnkey product that radically reduces reformulation times when manufacturers are considering how they'll do line development to make these batteries. The goal is to cut down on the time it takes to get to market and see the benefit of silicon batteries," said Ray.</p><p>At a high-level overview, Group14 is combining its SCC55 silicon-carbon material with BASF's Licity 2698 X F binder — a custom polymer made of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) with high stress-strain and elasticity that's designed for silicon-rich anodes. Ray noted that this collaboration makes it much easier for a battery manufacturer to make the switch to silicon-rich batteries. "It allows smaller battery manufacturers that may not have sophisticated capabilities for how they play with their chemistries to start to move a lot quicker in making the transition to silicon."</p>

<p>This is important, because the current generation of silicon carbon batteries used in phones have just 10% silicon in their anode. While silicon has greater energy density of 4200mAh/g — graphite has 372mAh/g — it expands considerably during charging and discharging. Mixing silicon with carbon — as Group14 is doing with SCC55 — increases the material's mechanical integrity while providing better conductivity.</p><p>Ray said the next iteration of batteries will see a greater mixture of silicon-carbon in the anode, with work underway on "full displacement" — completely switching to a silicon-carbon anode. Ray talked about two challenges to getting to that point. "One is the amount of time it takes, and the sophistication that battery vendors have when it comes to dialing in on the best cathode material, the best binder, the best housing, and reformulating their lines effectively."</p><p>The second limitation is availability; Ray says that the demand for the SCC55 material is significantly higher than supply, and the manufacturer is aiming to get its U.S. plant online in 2026 to cater to ever-increasing global demand. The current situation with tariffs is another hurdle that's leading to plenty of uncertainty, but Ray notes that Group14 is pushing ahead with its plans.</p><p>The brand has another plant in South Korea in a joint collaboration with SK, and this dual sourcing strategy allows it to deliver silicon batteries at a greater pace — Ray likened it to being a "local provider at a global scale. For us, the way that we get to our customers the fastest is we go to them from as close as possible. We're growing as fast as we possibly can, but the fact is that even this is still a drop in the bucket in the global demand for energy."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LuttrnvCDES2RLxV8hvoSC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LuttrnvCDES2RLxV8hvoSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While full displacement is still some time away, the advances in mixing higher ratios of silicon-carbon anode should deliver batteries with significantly greater density. "You're going to start seeing a much higher percentages of silicon in the batteries as we look to how silicon batteries develop in products over the coming couple of cycles."</p><p>This is like a push-pull effect, said Ray, where the phone manufacturers are pushing battery vendors to deliver increasing gains. "We also work directly with the OEMs so that they have a much better understanding of the real benefits of being able to do a full displacement, and they can push those battery manufacturers to go faster, because otherwise we're going to incremental increases."</p><p>It's not unfathomable to think next-gen phones featuring 10,000mAh batteries in roughly the same size as today's devices, and Ray said that phone manufacturers are not as risk-averse to trying out increasing silicon mixtures. While this tech is being pioneered by Chinese brands, Ray says we may see bigger brands like Samsung switch to silicon-carbon batteries in the near future — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> is touted to feature the battery next year.</p><p>Using flagships this year made me realize the potential of silicon-carbon batteries, and I'm excited to see how this tech evolves in 2026 and beyond. Most phones these days last at least a day and a half between charges, and I can't wait until the time comes when we'll only need to charge our phones twice or thrice a week.</p>

The latest addition is the 3-in-1 Go Power Bank, which includes a 5,000mAh battery in a travel-friendly design and a built-in USB-C cable. What's interesting is that the power bank has an integrated blade plug, transforming it into a 65W GaN charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="45fCTnuxPE6xn25FS3wRCG" name="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank" alt="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45fCTnuxPE6xn25FS3wRCG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The versatility makes it a decent option if you're looking at a travel-ready power bank that can also be used as a charger, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/nubia-RedMagic-Charger-5000mAh-Foldable/dp/B0DM8FYCYG">coming in at $59 on Amazon</a>, it is on the costlier side as these things go — you're basically paying for the convenience. Now, Redmagic calls this a 3-in-1 device, but that is disingenuous; think of it as a GaN charger with an integrated 20W power bank — the third use case is just the built-in cable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yvxzMoCE2Qy5mzLaBGwC6G" name="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank" alt="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvxzMoCE2Qy5mzLaBGwC6G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like its phones, Redmagic went with futuristic styling, and the power bank looks quite distinctive. The silver color scheme looks great, and the blocky design makes it easy to use. The included USB-C cable has a braided design and charges at 20W when using the internal power bank, and 60W when plugged in to a wall socket and using the GaN charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fCN73QVghAbeik8YbJTh5G" name="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank" alt="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCN73QVghAbeik8YbJTh5G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's start with the power bank side of things. The 5,000mAh size isn't adequate to fully charge your phone; in real-world use, you'll get around 2,700mAh of usable power out of this thing, and that's decent — all power banks have a similar efficiency. While it may not charge your phone to 100%, it is quite good at bringing it up to 60% if it's low on charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qRLuMQvo4MPVFfQXYsCswF" name="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank" alt="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qRLuMQvo4MPVFfQXYsCswF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also a tiny LCD panel that shows remaining battery level, and it ties into the design very well. I've had the power bank for just under two months now, and I didn't have any issues using it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei/huawei-mate-xt-camera-review">Huawei Mate XT</a>.</p>

<p>The internal battery of the power bank charges at 20W, and it takes just over 90 minutes to charge. While there are plenty of other choices if you just need a 5,000mAh power bank — I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/baseus-picogo-thinnest-magnetic-power-bank">Baseus' PicoGo magnetic products</a> — the main reason to consider the Go Power Bank is the 65W GaN charging. There's a single USB-C port at the back, and it relies on the USB PD protocol to deliver 65W of power to connected devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UFnK2gjJ8NRQgBCwL6AZ9G" name="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank" alt="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UFnK2gjJ8NRQgBCwL6AZ9G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can use USB-C out and the built-in USB-C cable to charge two devices at once, with the total power budget at 65W (45W + 20W). The GaN charging makes the Go Power Bank a great choice while traveling, and while the design may not be to everyone's tastes — it has a distinct gamer aesthetic — there are no problems with usability.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung rumors suggest the company is interested in upgrading the selfie camera of its Galaxy S25 FE.</li><li>The device could sport a 12MP selfie camera, which is suspected to deliver "better quality" photos, as it has been stuck with 10MP for a few generations.</li><li>Older rumors claim the S25 FE could launch in the "second half" of 2025 with MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 powerhouse.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There's another member of the Galaxy S25 era that we're waiting for, and this new rumor states it might come with an upgrade.</p><p>Rumors from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s25-fe/">Galaxy Club</a> (Dutch) suggest Samsung could bring a long-awaited upgrade to its expected Galaxy S25 FE (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-fe-gets-an-upgraded-selfie-camera-after-two-years/">SamMobile</a>). The "FE" part of this series stands for "Fan Edition," and things are kept pretty tame compared to Samsung's flagships. However, the publication's sources suggest the S25 FE will upgrade its selfie camera to 12MP.</p><p>With that, the safest piece of speculation is that consumers will be able to take "better selfies," as the post also notes.</p><p>Additionally, this rumor seemingly places the Galaxy S25 FE's selfie camera on the same level as its flagship counterparts. However, the publication is hesitant to speak on its true quality because, remember, FE is more budget-oriented.</p>
<h2 id="the-trail-so-far-2">The trail so far</h2>

<p>Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 lineup features a 12MP camera. Looking at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-cameras">our review of the base S25's</a>, there's not really much to write home about. The device's front camera does its job, offering a decent selfie experience, but it's nothing major. If the Galaxy S25 FE is to follow this trail, perhaps we already know what we're in for. However, the upgrade is nice, considering Samsung hasn't improved its FE's selfie camera for a couple of generations.</p><p>On the other hand, we're still unclear about its rear camera system. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a">S24 FE</a> features a triple array with a 50MP primary, a 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP telephoto. There's always hope for some improvement here, maybe with its telephoto, but don't hold your breath about it. Samsung typically keeps these things the same for a while before changing.</p><p>Previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s25-fe-might-pack-a-pleasant-hardware-twist">rumors claim</a> Samsung could hunt down MediaTek for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">Dimensity 9400</a> SoC for the S25 FE. Supposedly, the Korean OEM had originally wanted its in-house Ecynos chip inside, but sudden production issues have forced it into an alternative. MediaTek's chip is strong; however, and is the company's answer to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>Rumors claim Samsung could launch the Galaxy S25 FE in the "second half" of 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly switching gears, and chasing a different type of battery material known as "SUS CAN."</li><li>This material is designed to increase battery capacity, meaning future phones, like the Galaxy S26, could have "significantly" bigger capacities.</li><li>Old rumors claimed Samsung would chase silicon-carbon batteries; however, any upgrade would be nice as we've been stuck in 2019 with the same old, same old.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New information has allegedly come to light about Samsung's upgraded battery tech in its next wave of Galaxy phones.</p><p>The latest report arrives courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.co/tN3xAqF6Sg">The Elec</a> (Korean), which claims Samsung might've changed its mind about its (hopeful) battery tech upgrade (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1922928235974885882">Jukanlosreve</a>). This isn't "bad," technically, as the report says Samsung might look toward a different material, known as "SUS CAN." As the post notes, the purpose of this material swap is to finally provide stronger, longer-lasting batteries.</p><p>The tipster highlights the change could facilitate a "significant increase in battery capacity."</p><p>The publication's sources allege the SUS CAN is a "stainless steel" material that's currently in development by Samsung SDI. It's also worth mentioning that this same tech is inside Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max. This material change has two key focuses: boost energy density and improve Galaxy's charging speeds. Both of these areas would be welcome upgrades for Samsung's Galaxy phone line, which has become pretty stagnant.</p><p>More importantly, there's a chance we could see this battery tech arrive on the Galaxy S26 series next year.</p>
<h2 id="any-battery-upgrade-is-welcome-2">Any battery upgrade is welcome</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Korean media reports that Samsung plans to adopt a new technology in its next-generation model that could significantly increase battery capacity.According to the report, the technology involves a stainless steel material being developed by Samsung SDI, commonly referred to in…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1922928235974885882">May 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Additionally, sources claim SUS CAN could also reduce battery swelling. Speaking plainly, this would, ideally, increase the longevity of the battery, as one that swells is a telltale sign that it's time to chuck it.</p><p>Rumors that Samsung's future batteries could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">finally catch up to the competition</a> started earlier in February. That report came from FNNews (Korean), which alleged Samsung was chasing silicon-carbon batteries. We've seen this tech in a few places, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">like Honor's Magic 7 Pro</a>, which provides better durability and faster charging. Like the current rumors, those from February stated we may see this tech in "future Galaxy phones."</p><p>There's also speculation that Samsung's batteries could debut anywhere from 6,000mAh to 7,000mAh. There's nothing concrete about what sort of charging speeds Samsung could strive for, but hey, we can dream of something more than 45W.</p><p>If 45W grinds your gears, it's because Samsung has provided that same charging strength on its Ultra model for the past three generations. Essentially, we're all still vibing back in 2019. Samsung did work in a little magic with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> battery, bringing slightly faster charging, but it's clearly not cutting it.</p>

Instead, that shiny new key on your Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro is actually for the Essential Space, a brand new AI hub from Nothing. It's like an AI-powered memory for all your smartphone needs, housing photos, screenshots, notes, and voice memos in a singular place.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a> have a lot of competition in the midrange smartphone market, Essential Space <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">could be the differentiating factor</a>. If you're curious how to use Essential Space or how it might fit into your daily life, this guide will tell you everything there is to know about it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-essential-space-2">What is Essential space?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f49DaBEU8jfZWcfp5dFD4B" name="Essential-Key-Summarize" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f49DaBEU8jfZWcfp5dFD4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Essential Space is a new software feature Nothing introduced on the Phone 3a series that collects notes, screenshots, photos, and voice memos of your choosing. Then, it uses AI to summarize and analyze the information provided, creating action items. For example, if you upload a coupon to Essential Space, you might get a smartphone reminder to use it before it's about to expire.</p><p>For the most part, you interact with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3a-3a-pro-essential-key-update-3-1">Essential Space</a> using the Essential Key — the shiny dedicated button on the right side of your Nothing Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gbkK4QPUUbdDNQ668yEbHA" name="Essential-Key-Stacked" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbkK4QPUUbdDNQ668yEbHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can organize your thoughts with Collections, which are effectively folders that can be used to sort everything in your Essential Space. For now, there's no way to create a new note directly within the Essential Space — everything starts by pressing the Essential Key and taking a screenshot, photo, or recording a voice memo.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-save-photos-and-screenshots-to-essential-space-2">How to save photos and screenshots to Essential Space</h2>
<p>You can capture and save screenshots to Essential Space in seconds using the Essential Key. It's easier than using the standard Android shortcut, since you only need to press one button instead of two. Here's how:</p>
<p>1. Quickly <strong>click the Essential Key</strong> to take a screenshot.</p><p>2. Optionally use the <strong>text bar or voice icon</strong> to add a note.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>yellow arrow button </strong>to save your screenshot and any notes to Essential Space.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="trgp6b3UatUtDENScZgoKD" name="Essential-Space-Screenshot" alt="Using the Essential Key and Essential Space app on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/trgp6b3UatUtDENScZgoKD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a post-launch OTA update, Nothing added the ability to capture photos with the Essential Key, which are saved to the Essential Space. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Camera app</strong>.</p><p>2. <strong>Quickly press the Essential Key</strong> to snap a photo.</p><p>3. Optionally use the <strong>text bar or voice icon</strong> to add a note.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>yellow arrow button </strong>to save your photo and any notes to Essential Space.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BZKuvYkK4LHTSHntuuLcJE" name="Essential-Space-Photo" alt="Using the Essential Key and Essential Space app on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BZKuvYkK4LHTSHntuuLcJE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After that, you'll be able to access and analyze your photos, screenshots, and attached notes in the Essential Space — we'll cover how to do that later on.</p>

<p>Essential Space might be best viewed as a combination of a few different app ideas, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> and Pixel Recorder. For instance, you can save voice recordings to the Essential Space where they'll be transcribed and analyzed, just like you could on a Pixel. Here's how to do it on your Nothing phone:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Long-press the Essential Key </strong>to start a voice recording.</p><p>2.<strong> Keep the Essential Key pressed </strong>to continue recording,</p><p>3. <strong>Let go of the Essential Key</strong> to stop and save the recording.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AVgBoDGGoFgvYJTRtDF8dD" name="Essential-Space-Voice-Recording" alt="Using the Essential Key and Essential Space app on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AVgBoDGGoFgvYJTRtDF8dD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can then find your saved, transcribed recordings in the Essential Space app.</p>

<p>After you've captured photos, screenshots, and notes with Essential Space, you'll want to go back and view them. To do so, you can double-click the Essential Key from anywhere to open the app. You can also find it in your app drawer. Here are all the tips and tricks you'll need to know to manage your Essential Space:</p>
<p>1. Double-click the Essential Key to open Essential Space.</p><p>2. You'll see recent and suggested items at the top of the Essential Space homepage.</p><p>3. Scroll down to find <strong>Memory</strong>, which contains all of your saved content in chronological order.</p><p>4. Scroll further down to find <strong>Collections</strong>, which are used to organize your content.</p><p>5. <strong>Tap an item</strong> to open it in detail, including AI summaries, added content, and more.</p><p>6. <strong>Tap Add to Collection</strong> in the expanded view to organize your content.</p><p>7. <strong>Tap the three-button menu</strong> and press <strong>Delete</strong> to erase an item from your Essential Space.</p>

<p>Every smartphone brand is trying to pave its own path with AI, and Nothing's version of that is the Essential Space. It can't replace your notes app, but it can be a better way of organizing your photos, screenshots, and voice recordings than having them scattered across multiple apps.</p><p>Plus, Nothing has already expressed willingness to update and grow Essential Space's feature set, so it could improve further over time. It's a key benefit of purchasing a Nothing Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro, especially in the U.S., where cellular support is otherwise limited.</p>

The company mentions a few key aspects about the device, most notably its "premium sound." According to Sony, its latest headphones were created alongside the music industry's top recording studios, like Sterling Sound, Battery Studios, and Coast Mastering.</p><p>Regarding the device, Randy Merrill, mastering engineer from Sterling Sound, said the headphones "transport me to a different world with their excellent bass, frequency response, soundstage and detail and truthfully represent the sounds of the recordings that we work so hard to make."</p><p>Internally, the headphones are powered by Sony's HD Noise Canceling Processor QN3. The processor is said to achieve speeds that are "seven times faster" than its previous edition. Moreover, the WH-1000XM6 features 12 microphones (not a typo). Sony says this helps bring about a leap in noise-cancelling performance, as each mic adjusts your device for more immersive listening in noisy scenarios.</p><p>The headphone's Auto Ambient Sound mode will adjust your audio to the sound around you, so you don't miss a beat. Sony says you can use its Sound Connect app to adjust these settings manually or let the headphones do it themselves.</p>

<p>When it comes to Sony's design, the WH-1000XM6 feature a folding mechanism, which the post states its "durable." The fold makes the headphones a little smaller and more manageable inside bags or airplane pocket, per Sony. Consumers can also find these headphones with a new compact case with a magnetic lock.</p><p>The headphones themselves feature an "elegant, soft fit wider headband featuring synthetic leather ensuring a pressure-free fit." Sony highlights the ear cups, stating they have been outfitted with a stretchable material that shouldn't give consumers too much fatigue over long periods of use.</p><p>Additionally, there is a responsive touch panel and controls that let users quickly swap between the following modes: noise cancellation, ambient sound, and mute mic.</p>

<p>Sony says its usage of "high rigidity carbon fiber composite material" and a new voice coil helps to bring out every note in your music. The post states voices should be clearer with more defined instrumentals. The headphones even support Edge-AI, which is said to return the full potential of sound that could've been lost during compression.</p><p>Feature-wise, the WH-1000XM6 delivers Quick Access and Scene-based Listening. Each can connect to your Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music account.</p><p>The noise-cancelling headphones let users continue with their tunes even when plugged in (USB) for a charge. However, the headphones are said to last "up to" 30 hours on a full charge with their noise cancellation active. Sony states users can get roughly three hours of power in just three minutes.</p><p>As the WH-1000XM6 headphones launch today (May 15), Sony says you might see its ad campaign with the GRAMMY Award-nominated Post Malone. The artist states, "These new noise-cancelling headphones make you feel completely inside the music."</p><p>Sony's newest headphones are available in black, Platinum Silver, and Midnight Blue for $449 ($599 CAD). Consumers can look for them on Amazon, Best Buy, or Sony.com and other retailers.</p>

<p>As detective games, Shattered and Ghost Town couldn't be more different. In one, you play a paranormal detective with the power to seal away ghosts that can't seem to let go of this world. In the other, you're stuck in a mysterious mental facility, slowly losing your mind as you try to unravel the mystery of what brought you there.</p><p>Ghost Town is a fully immersive VR game made by the folks behind The Room VR, one of the most critically acclaimed games on the Meta Quest platform. Meanwhile, Shattered takes full advantage of the mixed reality capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, transforming your room into an interactive space that morphs along with the story.</p><p>Both games tell an incredible story that'll have you wondering what's next, not wanting to take the headset off until the mysteries have finally been solved. I haven't been this enamored with a detective game since that first Phoenix Wright release on the Nintendo DS eons ago. It's been incredible to don the detective hat once again and give myself a little taste of what being a modern-day Sherlock Holmes might feel like.</p>

<h2 id="entering-ghost-town-2">Entering Ghost Town</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/052hBB-f_EY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>You are Edith Penrose, a paranormal detective who is finally getting her act together in life and becoming a success, just as your brother goes missing. But he didn't go missing in any traditional sense of the word. Rather, the event plays out in a haunted theater as the two of you are trying to exorcise the ghost of the show's lead actress, who was inadvertently murdered during opening night by a faulty prop knife.</p><p>The storytelling, animations, and voice acting are beyond what you would typically expect from a VR game. That's not to say that there are no VR games that feature these qualities, quite the opposite, considering titles like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> exist, but I've come to expect that most VR games will always have a bit of an indie, understated flair to them.</p><p>This level of quality holds true throughout the entirety of the game's experience. The graphics are among the best I've ever seen on the Quest 3 and look more like a PC game, with very few exceptions. The environmental detail is superb, and while not <em>everything</em> in the environments is interactive, the available interactions are all done supremely well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v5FEf42jx9qDZWXLSVfg67" name="ghost-town-meta-quest-screenshot-02" alt="A screenshot from Ghost Town captured on a Meta Quest 3 showing your roommate aglow with light from an ethereal stained glass window" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v5FEf42jx9qDZWXLSVfg67.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Levers you pull and knobs you turn have a palpable weight to them. The environment feels like it actually exists all around you, even if this is just a fantasy story. The same feeling was also present in the studio's prior work, The Room VR, so while it's not surprising to see it carry over to another game, it still feels like a breath of fresh air in an era when even the biggest name games ship with ridiculously stupid bugs and other design problems.</p><p>Beyond just excellent base mechanics and environmental details, the game's puzzles, story, and settings are all incredibly well thought out and frightfully intriguing. I found myself thinking about the game hours after the end of a play session. It's a feeling I find happens most often with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> because of their unique spatial quality.</p><p>Solving the puzzles felt challenging and rewarding because the developers don't hold your hand, but they do leave enough hints in the area to help you understand what you're supposed to do and where you go next.  This quality is not often present in games, as it is very difficult to design environments so that the player has a general understanding of what they're supposed to do without having floating arrows or deliberate text telling players exactly what to do next.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p9nFEadzLNaNoVGn9pVR67" name="ghost-town-meta-quest-screenshot-01" alt="A screenshot from Ghost Town captured on a Meta Quest 3 showing the complex machinery underneath the lighthouse" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p9nFEadzLNaNoVGn9pVR67.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can still request a hint via a cleverly devised notebook system when you get stuck. Hints are found in the pull-out tab on the bottom of the notebook, but these hints don't feel too obvious, and there was never a time when I felt like I needed the developers to directly tell me what to do next.</p><p>Players familiar with The Room series will feel right at home with the puzzles here. While there is generally more narrative attached to the puzzles than some of the ones that series has, the general feel of most puzzles is right in line with what I expect from this developer's pedigree. These aren't obscure, sometimes obtuse puzzles, as I feel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/riven-meta-quest-3-impressions">the Myst series</a> can suffer from. Rather, the puzzles feel in line with the story and the setting, no matter where you are in the game.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QZQdnUFgcYonQsJiHxbz77" name="ghost-town-meta-quest-screenshot-03" alt="A screenshot from Ghost Town captured on a Meta Quest 3 showing your apartment building" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZQdnUFgcYonQsJiHxbz77.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I love how many different locales you'll go through in this game and how many characters you'll talk to, as well. Solving the “puzzle” of how to turn on the stage lights in an antiquated theater is a great example of how practical many of the games' puzzles are versus other titles that might throw you into a world filled with a collection of weird puzzles that don't make any sense in the greater context.</p><p>So far, Ghost Town is my meta quest game of the year. We might only be in May and have plenty to look forward to before the end of the year, but something this high quality only comes along every once in a while. It's a game I highly recommend to all Meta Quest players, especially since there's a free demo you can try before committing to the price.</p>

<p>I've played a ton of incredible mixed reality games since the Meta Quest 3 came out in 2023, but few nail the execution as well as Shattered. Like all mixed reality games, Shattered places virtual objects around the room you're physically standing in. Suddenly, you'll find a new door or window on your wall and, of course, you're immediately compelled to see what's behind it.</p><p>That's when things start to get really trippy. Just like in games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">The Last Stand or Spatial Ops</a>, these windows and doors are portals to another world. The door you just opened might lead to your sister's apartment, or the office you swore you left at 5 o'clock.</p><p>These portals aren't just relegated to windows or doors, though. Sometimes, they're holes in the wall, or maybe a hatch on the floor that you'll have to unlock and peer down through. The first time you open the hatch and look through your physical floor into a completely different room is a thing of true amazement.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PSdM6ePwanx7gsmoYH3Zna" name="shattered-meta-quest-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official mixed reality screenshot of Shattered taken on a Meta Quest 3 showing a memory playing out in a "portal" on a wall" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSdM6ePwanx7gsmoYH3Zna.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PlaySide Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But that portal isn't one you can walk through, only one you can see through. As such, you'll have to use your mind's powers to clone the room's objects by aiming at them and placing them in your physical space. In a way, it's like solving an escape room from the outside-in, and every new room feels fresh in a way that's physically impossible in real life.</p><p>As you make your way through each of the game's case files, which will take you around 4 hours to complete in total, objects will start to pile up in your room. While you can remove these objects when you're done with them, I enjoyed leaving as many as possible to remind myself what I'd solved up until this point.</p><p>The story is told in memory fragments that you'll grab and place around you, assembling each piece in your space like a Hollywood movie. It's an incredible feeling that's unmatched on the platform, and it's a game that simply wouldn't make sense outside of a mixed reality headset.</p>

<p>Google is redesigning how Wear OS will look on Pixel Watches. On the surface, Material 3 Expressive simply makes the UI more flashy and colorful. But I also believe it's a bit of a course correction to make the Pixel Watch 4 more appealing to core Pixel users.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">Android Show I/O edition</a> revealed what to expect from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> later this year. Scrolled content will "trace the curvature" of the rounded Pixel Watch display for smoother transitions, shrinking or expanding to match the available space.</p><p>They'll be better "responsive feedback" when tapping options, and your watch face theme will affect the colors throughout the UI.</p>

<p>Looks aside, Google promised "more engaging" Tiles with "quick access to information or actions," along with "space-efficient" notification buttons that convey more information. And, of course, Gemini will replace Assistant as your go-to Pixel Watch helper.</p><p>We'll see how much of a true smarts upgrade <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> can offer on smartwatch hardware. But this update will align Pixel Watches closer with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. And as much as I personally loved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Watch 3</a> for focusing so heavily on Fitbit, that route wouldn't work with Google's core audience in the long run.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PqXZpoB9SLWbgwNXTMhvZh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-app-drawer" alt="The Wear OS 5 app drawer on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PqXZpoB9SLWbgwNXTMhvZh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked my Android Central colleagues a few weeks back if they preferred stock Wear OS or One UI Watch on Galaxy Watches. It kicked off a fiery debate, and while several of us fell on the Pixel Watch side, our arguments were more about vibes than anything else. The One UI crowd had specifics.</p><p>Our managing editor, Derrek Lee, prefers One UI Watch "because it better mimics the UI on a smartphone," letting you swipe up or down to access apps or quick settings from any screen, or customize those quick settings. Stock Wear OS "feels oddly limited" while One UI Watch "feels more like Android."</p><p>Our contributor Brady Snyder called the Pixel Watch UI "unusable, more like a kid's toy or a Fitbit," saying it doesn't fully commit to either the smartwatch or fitness watch camp. He believes One UI "scales down to a smartwatch form factor" much better, and it displays fitness and health metrics in a more "engaging" way than stock Wear OS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng" name="google-pixel-watch-3-build-a-workout-on-watch.jpg" alt="Build workout on Pixel Watch 3 directly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite Derrek declaring his side "correct," the debate is still fully subjective. But it's also true that there's a lot of style and feature continuity between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5#section-one-ui-6-watch">One UI 6 Watch</a>, and the rumor is that the next version will bring familiar tools like the Now Bar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.</p><p>Stock Wear OS doesn't really feel like an extension of your Pixel phone software in the same way. Aside from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/we-weighed-galaxy-vs-pixel-watch-for-best-wear-os-watch-faces">cool watch faces</a>, there isn't much room for customization, as the interface is very minimalist, straightforward, and tailored. That will appeal to some people, but maybe not the core Android audience.</p>

<p>Google has clinical leads focused on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">heart health accuracy</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-clinical-sleep-lead-has-cool-ideas-for-future-of-smartwatch-sleep-tracking">sleep accuracy</a> to improve its Pixel Watch accuracy, and the last Wear OS update crammed in a bunch of running tools that would appeal to old Fitbit watch fans.</p><p>Most wearable brands are trying to offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">medical-grade accuracy</a> and fitness subscriptions, so it's no surprise that Google would take this route. But it's also true that its old audience loved Fitbits, in part, because they lasted a week per charge and had a simple interface. And many of these fans had iPhones.</p><p>No matter how much smarter Google makes Fitbit, those old fans aren't likely to pivot to a Pixel Watch that's not especially rugged, long-lasting, or affordable.</p><p>(Side note: I'm still annoyed that Google killed off Fitbit watches.)</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xK8nsr8pYWNm2VTN2yRKK6" name="Pixel-Watch-Material-3-Expressive" alt="A Pixel Watch showing the Gemini prompt for a "10 minute mile run playlist" on YouTube Music, with a Playlist button underneath it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xK8nsr8pYWNm2VTN2yRKK6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel Watch 3 catered to me as a runner; it had genuinely useful AI coaching and decent accuracy. But admittedly, I still prefer Garmin watches for all the reasons you'd expect. Only athletes who need a well-rounded experience would choose Google's 2-day smartwatch over any 7- or 14-day fitness watch.</p><p>Everyday Android users work out as much as anyone, but they were fine with something straightforward like Google Fit. What made people interested in a Pixel Watch was its <em>smarts</em>.</p><p>To Google's credit, it did make an effort with Wear OS 5 to add things like Nest Doorbell footage, Google TV controls, the Recorder app, and offline Google Maps. But it didn't upgrade the notifications, Tiles, or customization tools.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR.gif" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="400" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> could keep improving on the fitness front with cycling software, hiking maps in Google Maps, or rep counting at the gym. But that'll just be an important side dish, while the changes above will be the main course in making this watch more relevant for Android fans.</p><p>Google piggybacked on Gemini to sell a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-q3-2024-pixel-9-market-share-growth-report"> record number of Pixel 9s</a> last year, so it's no surprise that it would try to get its new AI on smartwatches as quickly as possible. In theory, Gemini Actions will transform the Wear OS experience by letting the AI do all the work of finding what you need.</p><p>And Material 3 Expressive, launched simultaneously on phones <em>and</em> watches, makes Wear OS 6 feel more like an extension of Android 16 instead of its own thing. I think that's a smart move on Google's part.</p>

But fair warning: they're also far pricier than the previous generation.</p><p>Successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>, the Forerunner 570 has a greater emphasis on triathletes with a new Garmin Coach option and custom multisport workouts built in the Connect app.</p><p>Unfortunately, this version still restricts key features to make the 970 more compelling, like offline maps, Hill/ Endurance scores, stamina, Strava Live Segments, and ClimbPro.</p>

<p>With the premium Forerunner 970, you get four extra days of battery life, sapphire crystal protection with a titanium bezel, ECG readings, and a few new premium running dynamics.</p><p>This model has jumped $150 in price compared to the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>, putting the 970 squarely into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>-lite territory. Garmin said during its recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">earnings call</a> that watch price increases were on the table, making this somewhat expected.</p><p>Neither new Forerunner watch offers any kind of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect+</a> trial period.</p><p>Below, we'll break down every key change Garmin has highlighted in the Garmin Forerunner 970 and 570, as well as how they compare to their predecessors!</p>
<h2 id="garmin-forerunner-570-key-changes-and-upgrades-2">Garmin Forerunner 570: Key changes and upgrades</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.00%;"><img id="7Qh2JGAwUY2URsLpKrAYtF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-lineup" alt="The six different Garmin Forerunner 570 models in various sizes and colors, arrayed in a line in white space and showing various watch faces and widgets." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Qh2JGAwUY2URsLpKrAYtF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1350" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Forerunner 570 adds an aluminum bezel, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Vivoactive 6</a>, making it slightly more distinct than the past polymer-only Forerunners. It comes in two sizes: 42mm (42g) with a 1.2-inch display and 47mm (50g) with a 1.4-inch display.</p><p>Both are 0.1-inch display upgrades over the Forerunner 265, which had a thicker display border. The Forerunner 570 is 3g heavier in both sizes, but still much lighter than most smartwatches.</p><p>Garmin also says it has the "brightest AMOLED display on any Garmin smartwatch." While they couldn't share specific nits of brightness, it is "twice as bright" as other AMOLED models, which is a significant jump and will help make them more visible and colorful in direct sunlight.</p><p>Perhaps because of the brighter display and mic/speaker combo, the Forerunner 570 battery falls slightly short of the 265 (11 vs. 13 days), while the multi-band GPS hours are unchanged (14 hours). The Forerunner 265S lasted 15 days or 15 hours, while the smaller 570 42mm only lasts 10 days and 13 hours.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ULzeL65ChsPtUbaszRSEvF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-calling" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 570 on a woman's wrist at the track, the screen showing her taking a phone call." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ULzeL65ChsPtUbaszRSEvF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the built-in mic and speaker, the Forerunner 570 will support Bluetooth calling, passthrough commands to your phone's Siri or Gemini, or on-watch commands. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/GUID-EECCAC99-90D6-4AB1-9A3A-EC433D3365E2/EN-US/GUID-5AA3DA43-FF89-4889-B897-CEF0A7E221C7.html">Fenix 8 owner's manual</a> lists out the kind of commands you can use, like starting a timer, changing music volume, or starting a workout.</p><p>You'll also get skin temperature changes in the Connect app, paired with your HRV score to help Garmin judge your sleep quality, recovery, and heat acclimation, while warning you of potential illness. You don't get ECG readings, however.</p><p>Garmin has confirmed that the Forerunner 570 and 970 both have the newest Elevate gen5 heart rate sensor, matching the Fenix 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>. Since other 2025 watches like the Instinct 3 and Vivoactive 6 stuck to last-gen sensors, this is a gratifying upgrade that'll keep serious runners happy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tLStnNiafTGvqN5UZfC3nF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-press-photo" alt="Several Garmin Forerunner 570 watches rendered in a black void, splayed along the left edge to create a slow-motion falling effect." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tLStnNiafTGvqN5UZfC3nF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Otherwise, all of the new Forerunner 570 features relate to software, starting with Evening Report. A complement to Morning Report, this version will remind you how much sleep you need, show your upcoming alarm, and list out tomorrow's weather forecast, calendar events, and suggested workout.</p><p>Garmin Triathlon Coach joins the Run, Swim, and Strength Coach options. All these training plans auto-update based on your current performance and fatigue levels, but the newest Coach will include Swim workouts, Two-a-Days, Brick workouts, and optional Strength training.</p><p>If you're following a course, Garmin will trigger the auto-lap mile times when you cross the course markers, rather than when your GPS <em>says</em> you've run a mile. And if you forget to stop your workout at the finish line, Garmin will "suggest trimming data" to match the course. Basically, Garmin will reward people who download GPX data beforehand with common-sense edits.</p><p>Lastly, the Forerunner 570 adds a dozen or so golfing features like yardage to green and a digital scorecard, plus a few new sports modes like Duathlon, Obstacle Racing, Hunting, and Fishing. The 570 ships in Slate Grey, Indigo, Amp Yellow, Cloud Blue, and Raspberry, and is available to order on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1464001/">Garmin's site</a>.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-forerunner-970-key-changes-and-upgrades-2">Garmin Forerunner 970: Key changes and upgrades</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="H7eBpoMwMcMJ4UZMFPke4G" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-lineup" alt="The three Garmin Forerunner 970 models rendered in white space in a line, showing a watch face, Running Economy widget, and a map view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H7eBpoMwMcMJ4UZMFPke4G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned above, the Garmin Forerunner 970 has a dozen or so price-locked software tools over the Forerunner 570, most notably preloaded road, trail, ski, and golf maps with 4X the storage. Just like with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a>, it's pretty disappointing that a $549 watch doesn't have offline maps, forcing you to spend $749 to get them!</p><p>The Forerunner 970 also has exclusive access to Strava and Garmin Live Segments, real-time stamina, Hill & Endurance Scores, Group LiveTrack, Trendline popularity routing, advanced cycling dynamics with grit and flow, and ClimbPro.</p><p>What's new compared to the Forerunner 965? The built-in LED flashlight, mic & speaker, sapphire crystal display protection, and support for the ECG app and skin temperature readings give the Forerunner 970 most of the $1,100 Fenix 8's headliner features, which is how you could convince yourself that $749 is actually a fair price.</p><p>I'd also hoped to see cellular support on the Forerunner 970, given the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/garmin-fenix-8-could-get-a-massive-upgrade-in-the-form-of-lte">Fenix 8 LTE leak</a>. Unfortunately, you'll still need your phone on hand for phone calls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4kBjSXpTAXmxiNoq3uMptD" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-preloaded-maps" alt="Render of the Garmin Forerunner 970 in a black void, the image focused on turn-by-turn navigation on a city-streets map." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4kBjSXpTAXmxiNoq3uMptD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Forerunner 970 lasts 15 days or 21 multi-band GPS hours, while the Forerunner 265 lasted 23 days but only 19 multi-band GPS hours. It's 3g heavier than the Forerunner 965, but also 0.3mm thinner. At 56g, it's significantly lighter than a Fenix 8 because only its bezel is titanium, not the entire body.</p><p>While you might resent losing a week of battery life, the Forerunner 970 has the same doubled brightness for enhanced visibility. And the addition of ECGs and skin temp readings, plus the gen5 optical heart rate sensors, will help the 970 deliver more accurate results than the already-reliable 965.</p><p>Otherwise, there are very few software differences between the 970 and 965, aside from new advanced running dynamics tools: Running tolerance, running economy, and step speed loss.</p><p>Running tolerance "better understands the impact each run has on the body," with a "recommended weekly maximum mileage" to warn you off of overtraining. Running economy focuses on your "overall energy efficiency," while step speed loss calculates "how much an athlete slows down when their foot hits the ground." But since the latter two require buying and wearing the new $169 HRM 600 chest strap, only running tolerance is built into the Forerunner 970.</p><p>The Forerunner 970 ships in Carbon Grey DLC, Titanium, and Soft Gold in one 47mm size and is available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1462801/">Garmin's site</a>. It ships on May 21.</p>

<hr>
<p>Each year, Google announces a slew a features for Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) and this year isn't any different. Today (May 15), Google announced that it is rolling out new updates to its products across Android and Chrome, and adding new resources for developers who building speech recognition tools.</p><p>Google is highlighting how it's integrating Gemini and AI into its accessibility features to improve usability for users with low vision or hearing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RuJqNR2xctHijghSTEQkqM" name="Gemini-Talkback-Option-" alt="Google brings Gemini powered updates for GAAD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RuJqNR2xctHijghSTEQkqM.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is expanding its existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-google-talk-back">TalkBack</a> option with the ability for people to ask questions and get responses related to the image that they were sent or are viewing. That means the next time a friend texts you a photo of their new guitar, users can get a description of the image and ask follow-up questions about the make and color, or even what else is in the image.</p><p>Taking it a step further with AI, Google says users can not only get descriptions of the image, but also the entire screen they're viewing. For instance, "if you’re shopping for the latest sales on your favorite shopping app, you can ask Gemini about the material of an item or if a discount is available," the tech giant explained.</p>
<p>Google is launching a much-needed feature called Expressive Captions, which helps the listener gauge the mood and emotion of the video. The tech giant states that phones will be able to provide real-time captions for anything with sound across apps.</p><p>It uses AI to not only capture what someone says, but more importantly, how they say it. For instance, if you're watching an intense game and the commentator is calling out an “amaaazing shot,” or when the video message is not “no” but a “nooooo.”</p><p>This AI-powered feature will be able to identify sounds that are dragging out words, to give you accurate captions. It can also spot when people are whistling or clearing their throats, making captions less redundant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A52PBxHoDFapUruAtyZvUY" name="Google-GAAD-Expressive-captions" alt="Expressive captions on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A52PBxHoDFapUruAtyZvUY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This new version of Expressive Captions is rolling out in English in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia for devices running Android 15 and above.</p><p>Lastly, Google is taking steps to continue to make its digital platform more accessible and inclusive. It is giving developers access to its open-source repository from<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/impaired-speech-recognition/"> Project Euphonia</a> (How AI improves products for people with impaired speech).</p><p>By opening up its resources, developers around the world will be able to personalize audio tools for research ,which could help train their models for diverse speech patterns, Google explained.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is putting the spotlight on how Chromebooks are making school way more accessible, especially for students with disabilities.</li><li>ChromeVox will soon turn audio captions into braille when connected to a braille display.</li><li>Natural-sounding “read aloud” voices are now built right in Chrome's Reading Mode, which is great news for students with dyslexia or reading struggles.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is spotlighting how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">Chromebooks</a> are helping students with disabilities thrive in observance of the Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/global-accessibility-awareness-day-2025" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Tricia Davis-Muffett, a senior director at Google for Education, shared how Google's approach to accessibility on Chromebooks is making education more inclusive.</p><p>Some students can’t use a mouse or keyboard easily, Davis-Muffett noted. This is where Chromebook's Face Control steps in, literally letting students navigate their devices with facial gestures such as head tilts and eyebrow raises instead of mouse clicks.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-are-getting-new-real-time-controls-and-engagement-tools-for-educators">rolled out this feature in January with ChromeOS 132</a>, and it’s based on Android’s Project Gameface.</p><p>On top of this feature, the tech giant announced today that ChromeVox, the built-in screen reader for Chromebooks, is getting a nifty upgrade. Soon, when connected to a braille display, it’ll convert audio captions into braille.</p>
<h2 id="braille-gets-a-boost-2">Braille gets a boost</h2>
<p>That means students with visual impairments can independently read what’s on screen without waiting for anyone else to catch them up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TSD4KZf9cfEpXer2LeDcQ6" name="Acer Chromebook" alt="Acer Chromebook on table open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TSD4KZf9cfEpXer2LeDcQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChromeVox, Google's built-in screen reader, was introduced in Chrome OS version 56.</p><p>Furthermore, for visually impaired students (and keyboard power users), Caret Browsing lets them move through a webpage using only their keyboard. It drops a blinking cursor on the page, like in a Word document, and it’s all arrow keys and tab navigation from there.</p><p>Google also highlights Chrome’s Reading Mode, touting that it now offers a “read aloud” feature with natural-sounding voices. This feature is particularly beneficial for students who struggle with dyslexia or other reading challenges. And because it's baked right into Chromebooks, there’s no need for third-party software.</p>
<h2 id="standardized-test-friendly-2">Standardized test-friendly</h2>
<p>If you're taking the SAT or AP exams on a Chromebook, the College Board’s Bluebook app now works hand-in-hand with ChromeOS accessibility features like Dictation and ChromeVox. This eliminates the need for separate testing accommodations.</p><p>The best part is that these tools aren’t tucked away or hidden behind premium paywalls since they're baked into Chromebooks and ready to go from the first login. Google also highlights how partner apps from the Google for Education App Hub are building even more support on top of these features.</p>

<ul><li>The Honor 400 series will feature a new Google Cloud-powered AI tool that converts static images into five-second videos.</li><li>Alongside the new feature, Honor 400 users will also be offered creative control tools without needing to rely on third-party apps.</li><li>While Honor 400 users will reportedly have free access with limitations for the first two months, a subscription from Google will eventually be required to continue using the feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor 400 series is gearing up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-series-launching-globally-may-22">launch next week</a>, and ahead of its release, the company already has some exciting AI news about the upcoming devices to share.</p><p>The devices are said to be debuting with a Google Cloud-powered AI image-to-video feature that allows users to transform static images like their personal photos into AI-generated artwork into a five-second video, which for some reason is believed to be shareable on social media.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:281px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.94%;"><img id="Z23MAUhQFU8dDFUbog2pAf" name="Honor-AI-image-to-video-demo-1" alt="Honor AI image to video feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z23MAUhQFU8dDFUbog2pAf.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="281" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The upcoming Honor 400 models are already touted to have flagship-level AI capabilities, alongside having the best AI camera phone in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> segment. Users are further expected to get creative control without relying on third-party apps. The demos of the newly announced AI feature also appear promising, as Honor has shared some videos (converted to GIFs, and the quality might be affected) of the same.</p><p>The static images here include Lady with an Ermine, a self-portrait of Van Gogh, Las Meninas, a sunrise impression, and The Cheat with the Ace of Clubs painting by Georges de La Tou. Converting such static images and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubMmbFvCf5Q">actual photos of people</a> into video clips certainly looks impressive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YH3A2XkQvDUNFoPFN2kPWY" name="Honor-AI-image-to-video-demo" alt="Honor AI image to video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YH3A2XkQvDUNFoPFN2kPWY.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Honor 400 series will have a real advantage, we would definitely be seeing it in other Android handsets soon since it is based on Google Cloud, the search giant’s Veo 2 model, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664812/google-honor-ai-image-to-video-gemini">The Verge</a>, and it is already available on Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini Advanced</a> subscription — however, it is currently based on text input and not image-to-video as seen in the upcoming Honor 400 series. The latter is still available in Google Cloud, and the search giant is charging 50 cents per second of output — and also available only for “approved users.”</p><p>And there’s yet another catch as well, per the publication, the AI image-to-video will be free for Honor 400 users for the first two months, and a limit of only ten videos per day. Honor’s U.K. marketing director, Chris Langley, has further confirmed to The Verge that the feature to stay active would “eventually require some subscription” from Google.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the company is gearing up to launch the Honor 400 and the Honor 400 Pro on May 22. It is a global launch happening in London, and both are believed to have a 200MP primary lens.</p>

<p>Both fitness trackers also feature water sports (route) tracking functionality, next to an air pressure sensor with a promise to enhance overall outdoor sports data measurement accuracy. The Pro model further includes sports modes like professional trial running, pro-level golfing, and a new barometer for elevation gain data in mountain climbing.</p>

<p>The FreeBuds 6, on the other hand, are a pair of open-fit earbuds that feature a dual-driver unit and claim to deliver strong and punchy bass. They are offered in a sleek and ergonomic design and incorporate features like stable and clear calls for better communication.</p><p>Lastly, the MatePad Pro is the latest 12.2-inch tablet that equips a Tandem OLED PaperMatter Display, which further supports anti-glare and anti-reflection capabilities. The tablet can also be paired with Huawei’s Glide keyboard, which boasts typing convenience. It also features a charging compartment to store the stylus.</p>

<p>All these products can be purchased through the Huawei Store, and the Huawei Watch 5 starts at £399.99. The Huawei Watch Fit 4 starts at £149.99, and the Pro model at £249.99. The FreeBuds 6, on the other hand, are available at £139.99, and the MatePad Pro pricing is yet to be determined. These products, however, are very unlikely to make their way to the U.S. market since it’s Huawei.</p>

We have our review out, and it's clear Motorola set out to create one of the best flip phones. In fact, dare we argue that it could be one of the best phones of 2025?</p><p>Our Managing Editor Derrek Lee took the time and effort to test the phone, so make sure you check his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 review</a>.</p><p>We share the best Motorola Razr 2025 deals, compare our findings with other Moto reviews, and break down the most important Motorola facts to know before you buy one!</p><p>We'll also share all of the relevant and related articles for the phone so that you don't have to go anywhere.</p>

<p>Motorola's latest foldable phones have arrived, headlined by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review#section-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-specs-and-performance">Moto Razr Ultra</a>. This is a true flagship in every sense of the word, as we have the Snapdragon 8 Elite at the helm, paired with 16GB of RAM and either 512GB or 1TB of storage.</p><p>Of course, the star of the show is the 7-inch foldable pOLED display, with its 165Hz refresh rate and ability to reach up to 4,500 nits of peak brightness. But that's not all, as the 4.5-inch pOLED cover screen gets even better with the ability to add app shortcuts, along with panels for different apps and widgets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SFZpUvMcbQHbE5UYhd4cqA" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-28" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 on table next to a plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SFZpUvMcbQHbE5UYhd4cqA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, has been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review#section-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-specs-and-performance">Razr Ultra</a> for the past week, and so far, he seems to be enjoying it quite a bit. Starting off with the design, Derrek points out that Motorola has been able to retain its "unique styling with vegan leather, Alcantara, and wood finishes."</p><p>Those finishes paired with the brushed metal frame look simply stunning, and are frankly, sorely needed in a sea of phones plagued by a lack of imagination. It's very reminiscent of the old Moto Maker days, I just kind of wish we could mix and match or have some type of control over the combinations.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nryK77vyP4WrEKFpih5vHB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-24" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 next to a small vase with a plant inside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nryK77vyP4WrEKFpih5vHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3995" height="2247" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that came as a surprise when reading Derrek's review was that Motorola has included "Flicker prevention for users with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>." This is something that our colleague Nick Sutrich has to contend with when using different phones, with some being better than others. I'd really be interested to see how Nick would fare with using the Razr Ultra, but I also know he's more than happy with the OnePlus 13.</p><p>By all accounts, the pOLED displays that Motorola is using for the Razr Ultra look beautiful, and I was even surprised to see that the main screen offers a 165Hz refresh rate. It really seems like Motorola is taking the fight to Samsung, as we suspect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will be hitting the market sometime in the next few months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="oqRYFdM42GqzZDdcjwbkrB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-26" alt="Moto AI options on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oqRYFdM42GqzZDdcjwbkrB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It wouldn't be a new phone launch in 2025 if AI weren't involved in some form, and that remains true with the Razr Ultra. Motorola introduced quite a few improvements to its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, such as "Look & Talk." This allows you to simply start interacting with Moto AI whenever the Ultra is in "Tent or Stand mode," as you just have to "look at it, and begin listening to you."</p><p>Unlike what we've seen from the most recent crop of Galaxy phones, AI implementation on the Razr Ultra takes a different approach. While we have Moto AI and Google Gemini, Motorola is also making other AI services available, such as Meta AI, Copilot, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">Perplexity</a>. Of those three, Motorola is putting Perplexity first, as you'll get a free Perplexity Pro trial with every purchase.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wEBmW5iMfKgcFoMC2RAEUC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-18" alt="Image Studio on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wEBmW5iMfKgcFoMC2RAEUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The AI fun doesn't stop there, however, as features such as Image Studio and Playlist Studio are offered as a way to let your imagination run wild with the help of AI. As pointed out by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/667277/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review-battery-screen">The Verge</a>, other AI-powered features are also onboard, such as "Remember This" which saves "screenshots, text, and photos so you can ask about them later." It sounds a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> app, without being limited to <em>just</em> screenshots.</p><p>However, The Verge goes on to say that it's not quite "as useful in a personal assistant," with Moto AI being "a little slow to respond to a query since part of it runs in the cloud." One can only hope that this is just a case of growing pains, and that the speed and performance will improve as more people begin using these features.</p>

<p>One area of concern that some might have is the camera system that Motorola employs. Although previous iterations haven't been terrible, they also haven't quite matched up to the rest of the competition. Seeing as the Razr Ultra is a flagship device, Motorola turned things up a notch, as evidenced by its "collaboration" with Pantone.</p><p>As a reminder, the Razr Ultra 2025 is equipped with two rear cameras, utilizing a 50MP main lens and a 50MP ultrawide sensor. Derrek points out that the colors from pictures taken with the main lens "feel much punchier," which they attribute to the aforementioned Pantone collaboration.</p><p>This sentiment regarding the main camera is largely echoed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Max Buondonno of The Shortcut</a>, as he says "The result is photos that look more true to life than any other Razr in the past."</p>

<p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip</a> might be more mainstream, we really have Motorola to thank for making the cover screen actually usable. The Razr Plus 2024 made it possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">use any app that you wanted</a>, and the Razr Ultra 2025 takes things further by letting you set up multiple pages full of apps, widgets, and other various shortcuts.</p><p>Derrek says this "remains one of my favorite ways to use the Razr." Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/i-tested-the-motorola-razr-ultra-its-good-but-flipping-expensive/">Patrick Holland of CNET</a> exclaims they "feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed."</p><p>The lack of a useful cover screen was one of the reasons why I ended up gravitating back to book-style foldable phones. But after reading Derrek's review and seeing what others have said, I <em>might</em> just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/i-want-motorola-to-make-a-galaxy-z-fold-competitor-but-the-razr-ultra-is-still-tempting">find a way</a> to take the Razr Ultra 2025 for a spin myself.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hmTcExnsuRT8CCZsbLP4zD" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-38" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with mulch covering the bottom half" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hmTcExnsuRT8CCZsbLP4zD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One area of concern for anyone considering a foldable phone is durability. There are plenty of horror stories about someone waking up and opening their phone, only to be greeted with a broken screen. For the most part, it seems those days are largely behind us, as the hardware has been improved.</p><p>However, another aspect of that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">water and dust resistance</a>, with many foldable phones not being able to withstand the elements very well. Thankfully, that shouldn't be too much of an issue with the Razr Ultra 2025, as it features an IP48 rating.</p><p>The key here is the first digit, with the "4" essentially meaning that the phone is protected from dust wreaking havoc. But we still wouldn't recommend taking this with you to the beach. On the other hand, the "8" signifies that the Razr Ultra 2025 is capable of being submerged in up to almost 5 feet of water (or 1.5 meters), for up to 30 minutes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3979px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-01" alt="Charging the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3979" height="2238" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life is another sore subject for foldable phones, as there's even less room in the chassis compared to standard "slab" phones. The Razr Ultra 2025 performs admirably, as Derrek has had "no complaints with battery life," stating that "You'll get a full day of use" with relative ease.</p><p>Not only that, but Motorola didn't hold back with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-charging-speed">charging rates</a>, as the Razr Ultra 2025 enjoys up to 68W speeds when using a cable. Wireless charging also gets a boost, as it tops out at 30W charging speeds, both of which are quite welcome.</p><p>The only "catch" here is that Motorola doesn't include a charger in the box. On the bright side, there is no shortage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">great options</a> out there, and we wouldn't be surprised if you didn't already have one at home.</p>

<p>It can be rather overwhelming if you're trying to decide whether it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2023">worth upgrading</a> to a new phone. Motorola didn't do much to help make things easy with its 2025 lineup, as all three models are great in their own way.</p><p>The only obvious upgrade should be if you already have the Razr Plus 2023, as these new models blow it out of the water. AC Contributor Brady Snyder <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/should-you-buy-the-motorola-razr-ultra-2025">takes a deeper look</a> at making such a decision, providing reasons for upgrading regardless of whether you have an existing Razr or if you might be looking beyond the confines of Samsung's ecosystem.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4094px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wGSvwWdUxU9qR2rNBgxuaC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-29" alt="Moto AI summarizing messages on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGSvwWdUxU9qR2rNBgxuaC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4094" height="2303" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's easy to be overwhelmed by notifications these days, as every app is vying for your attention and seems to think a plethora of notifications is the only way to hold it. Motorola thought of this and designed a way to help cut down on the problem by introducing AI-powered notification summaries.</p><p>As you can see from the photo above, Moto AI will give you brief snippets of what's happening in each conversation, complete with quick action buttons that you can tap. Whether this is just marking the message as read and making it go away, or tapping an automatic response to make it seem like you're paying attention, is totally up to you.</p><p>We'll likely see a similar feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-notification-summaries">come to Android 16 more widely</a>, but for now, Motorola has the monopoly on the concept on the Android side of things. Apple introduced a similar feature in iOS 18 last year, but it infamously does a terrible job of summarizing things. Whether Moto AI does any better of a job for you is probably up in the air, but it's been a cool feature to play around with so far, nonetheless.</p>

<p>While we're on the subject of Moto AI, let's talk about the new AI-generated content the Razr Ultra 2025 allows you to make. Playlist Studio is easily one of the more creative AI-generated features we've seen on any phone, as it lets you ask for a playlist based on basically anything.</p><p>Android Authority's Ryan Haines asked for something as ridiculous as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/motorola-playlist-studio-3548715/">Y2K pizza party jams</a>" and Moto AI spit out a playlist with artists like Nelly, Beyonce, and several others that fit the bill for the era.</p><p>Playlist Studio currently uses Amazon Music as the backend for delivering songs, but don't worry, you don't need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">Amazon Prime</a> subscription to use it! Just make sure you've got an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/music/free">Amazon Music free account</a> and you're good to go.</p>

<p>Motorola's camera game has improved tenfold over the company's older phones, and a lot of that has to do with the inclusion of smarter software. This year, Motorola is doubling down on the inclusion of AI-powered camera tricks, including its own version of the Google Pixel's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>. Motorola's feature is called Group Shot, and it ensures that everyone's face looks its best when you take a bunch of photos at a time.</p><p>The key here is not only to have everyone together in a photo, but to take a handful of photos each time you open the camera. After that, the back end does most of the work, making suggestions on a new best group photo for you to use.</p><p>Motorola is also improving its motion capture game with a new Action Shot mode that prioritizes moving subjects and does its best to ensure they're captured without blur. Your results may vary, but it's a big step in the right direction for a company that has historically struggled with camera quality.</p>

<p>Looking to upgrade to the Motorola Razr Ultra (2025), but aren't sure if you should wait until Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> gets announced? While we can't guarantee Samsung won't make something better, there are a few things to consider.</p><p>Both the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) will most certainly be using the same Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. There won't be a better processor available in 2025, and there's no reason to think Samsung will use something less powerful. But while processing power is the same, Motorola's battery tech <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/thin-phones-are-cool-but-samsung-isnt-the-right-company-to-make-them-right-now">is much better than Samsung's</a>.</p><p>Not only is the Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) battery already good, but it supports 68W wired charging so you can get a quick top-up in a few minutes before you walk out the door. Meanwhile, no rumors point to the possibility that Samsung will offer faster charging on the Flip 7 than it did on the Flip 6. For note, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 charges at a paltry 25W rate, taking well over an hour to fully charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G7AZhyMbZz5wwPtP8Sgp4C" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-08" alt="Widgets on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G7AZhyMbZz5wwPtP8Sgp4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola's Razr cover screen has always been immensely more useful than Samsung's, and while we haven't seen any leaks or rumors pointing to a change, there's always the chance Samsung listens to user feedback and gives the Z Flip 7's cover screen a full overhaul.</p><p>If it doesn't, though, know that Motorola makes it dead easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">use most apps on the cover screen</a> compared to Samsung's very limited, widget-based cover screen. If you haven't used a flip phone lately, you'll be surprised at how useful the smaller cover screen is and how often you'll end up using it instead of flipping open that big screen.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting hardware choices Motorola made with the Razr Ultra (2025) is the inclusion of an ultrawide-angle camera instead of a telephoto camera on the cover. You might be wondering <em>how</em> such a minimal thing could be interesting, and that answer all lies in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">differences between the three Razr 2025</a> models.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) sports the best camera hardware, as you would expect, with a pair of 50MP sensors on the cover display and one 50MP sensor above the inside display. The base Razr also has a 50MP main camera sensor — albeit with a smaller, less performant sensor — and a 13MP ultrawide sensor. So far, that seems to match expectations, but then we look at the middle child.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Plus (2025) retains the secondary telephoto lens from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus (2024)</a> instead of opting for a secondary ultrawide lens like the other two models. It's hard to know exactly why Motorola made this choice, but it also complicates the decision to choose between the three models because of the camera differences. Regardless, our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra (2025) review</a> points out that the change was a good one, as zoom performance remains solid despite the lack of a telephoto camera.</p>

<p>If you're having a hard time choosing between the Razr Plus (2025) and the Razr Ultra (2025), here are a few things that might make the Ultra worth the extra cost to you.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor inside the Razr Ultra is roughly twice as fast as the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 inside the Razr Plus. That's quite literally double the speed for just 30% more money. On top of that, you're getting the best displays on any Motorola phone, double the storage,</p><p>Gorilla Glass Ceramic is also present on the Ultra's cover, while the Plus model features Gorilla Glass Victus. If those names don't mean much to you, know this. Victus was introduced as Corning's strongest glass in 2020, while Ceramic was introduced in March of this year. Ceramic is made to withstand as many as 10 drops in a row from 1 meter high on asphalt, while Victus is only rated for a single drop on concrete from up to 2 meters.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) has a 700mAh larger battery than the Razr Plus (2025). The Ultra sits at 4,700mAh while the Plus sports just a 4,000mAh battery. If we're just going by the math, that means the Razr Ultra should get roughly 15% better battery life than the Plus, on average.</p><p>Let's also not forget that the Razr Ultra (2025) comes in a bevy of colors and materials that you can't get on the other two Razr (2025) models. That includes fan favorites like wood and new choices like Alcantara, all of which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">make the Razr Ultra (2025) a sensory delight</a>.</p>

<p>Motorola really went all out with AI on the Razr Ultra and didn't just partner with Google for Gemini but also with a few other companies to ensure the Razr Ultra has <em>all the AI</em>.</p><p>Ryan Whitwam of Ars Technica <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/motorola-razr-and-razr-ultra-2025-review-cool-as-hell-but-too-much-ai/">writes in his Razr Ultra review</a> that he doesn't like this approach, saying it's too much. "It's hard to say exactly how much AI is worth having on a phone with the rapid pace of change, but Motorola has settled on the wrong amount. To be blunt, there's too much AI."</p><p>I definitely agree that there's a lot going on, and it can be overwhelming if you let it. Fortunately, a lot of the Moto AI triggers, like the power button or floating icon, can be disabled to help simplify things. So, for me, the only way to trigger Moto AI is with the AI Key or with Look & Talk.</p><p>I also feel like Moto AI is much less prevalent throughout the OS than Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> on its phones, which is seemingly everywhere you look.</p><p>Still, it would be cool if Motorola gave users more control over their AI experience (i.e., what gets processed locally vs. in the cloud) since we now have so many options.</p>

<p>Philip Berne at TechRadar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review" target="_blank">writes in his Razr Ultra review</a>" that "Motorola seems to have borrowed Samsung's color tuning philosophy" when referring to the camera quality. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Our review</a> also shares this sentiment, noting that "images that feel more Samsung in terms of color and saturation, while the added depth and definition remind me a bit of a Pixel."</p><p>Whatever Motorola is doing with Pantone, I hope they keep it up, because the camera improvements are quite noticeable.

<p>Did you know that the Motorola Razr Ultra has ultra-wideband (UWB)? This wasn't on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, and it seemingly makes the Razr Ultra even more ultra.</p><p>This is important because UWB allows the phone to do some interesting things, such as more precise item tracking with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/googles-popular-find-my-device-gets-a-revamp-and-notable-enhancements">Google's new Find Hub</a> and UWB-enabled trackers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/motorola-moto-tag-hands-on-review">Moto Tag</a>.</p><p>It also means the Razr Ultra should be compatible with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-razr-plus-2024-and-moto-edge-50-ultra-can-now-unlock-bmws">Motorola's BMW Digital Key</a>. "The phone's ultra-wideband (UWB) technology allows the car to automatically unlock as you approach," the company announced in a press release last year. UWB functionality was initially available for the Edge 50 Ultra, while the Razr Plus utilized NFC, meaning you had to physically tap a car to open it.</p>

<p>Based on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.slashgear.com/1860379/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review-flip-phone-classic-retakes-foldable-crown/">Razr Ultra review</a>, Adam Doud over at SlashGear seemed to really enjoy the phone, calling it "the first true flagship phone that you can fold in half." With specs that rival the Galaxy S25 Ultra, that seems like a fair assessment of the Razr Ultra (I would say so).</p><p>However, he does note that "the biggest miss in this generation of Razr is the lack of notable upgrades on the lower two devices, despite retaining the same price tag." I definitely agree that the Razr Plus 2025 was an interesting choice, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024">when you compare it to the Razr Plus 2024</a>, since they're pretty much identical.</p><p>On the other hand, the Razr 2025 does include some notable upgrades worth looking at, especially for a $700 foldable. It has a bigger battery, improved hinge, an upgraded chip, and cameras with true-to-life Pantone Validated color and skin tones for (hopefully) better photos. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> was already a steal, especially when it went on sale, but this year's is also not one to ignore if the Razr Ultra is a little too expensive.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/should-you-buy-the-motorola-razr-ultra-2025">Which Razr 2025 model is right for you</a>?</p>

<p>Motorola always seems to find intuitive ways for users to interact with the unique form factor of clamshell foldables, and that's really what makes the Razr Ultra 2025 special. By far, my favorite way to use flip-style foldables is as a portable camera. On the newer model, you get two rear 50MP sensors on the back and one 50MP selfie camera on the inside. But of course, the Razr Ultra 2025 can use <em>any</em> one of its cameras as a selfie camera.</p><p>That opens up a number of possibilities, like Camcorder Mode, which lets you keep the phone half-opened in your hand — like an old-school camcorder. Both you and the person you're filming will get a handy preview of the video feed utilizing the two displays, and it's a game-changer. Flip phones are all about nostalgia, and Camcorder Mode — also a staple of past Razr flagships — reminds me a lot of my Flip camcorder from way back when.</p><p>There are also a ton of other handy modes and features, like Group Shot for group photos and Action Shot for moving subjects. You can always prop up your Razr as a tripod anywhere, too. The versatility of clamshell foldables, and specifically the upgraded Razr Ultra 2025 camera system, is part of what makes them great.</p>

<p>By now, you probably know that the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which is a first-of-its-kind move. But how much does that affect performance? If you're curious, we ran Geekbench 6.4 on the Razr Ultra 2025, Razr 2025, and its closest competitors. Here's how they fared:</p>
<div >
<table>

</table>
</div>
<p>What can we learn from these results? The Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset in the Razr Ultra 2025 helps the phone perform better, especially in multi-core performance, than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Surprisingly, the last-gen chip in Samsung's foldable doesn't falter, as it beats the Razr Ultra 2025 in single-core performance. But it's hard to understate the massive improvements made to multi-core performance between the Razr Plus 2024 and the Razr Ultra 2025.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Razr 2025's chip upgrade seems to be in name only, as there are no noticeable performance improvements in synthetic tests compared to the prior model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="epQfC67j8HTnQPnbRxpksA" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-02" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 main display outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/epQfC67j8HTnQPnbRxpksA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reviewers seem to agree that the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is an outstanding flip phone, perhaps the best clamshell foldable we've seen commercially available in the U.S. The better question is whether the Razr Ultra 2025 is worth the $1,299 price tag it comes with. While the hardware is certainly there, with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, a trio of 50MP cameras, and major durability improvements, software is still a concern.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 ships with Android 15, the most current public version of Android. However, Motorola is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">only promising three years of Android OS upgrades</a>. That's way less than the competition, as the cheaper Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is supported for a whopping seven years of Android OS upgrades. Considering the company's less-than-stellar track record with updates, this should give every potential buyer pause before dropping a ton of cash on a Razr Ultra 2025.</p>

<p>The new hinge on the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is an underrated upgrade this time around. Motorola, a company relatively new to foldables compared to the likes of Samsung, hasn't always offered an outstanding hinge. My experience with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023's hinge was so disappointing compared to the Samsung ones I was used to that I didn't use the phone nearly as much as I hoped.</p><p>Now, there's a new titanium-reinforced hinge for the Razr 2025 series that addresses nearly all of my concerns with prior models. Our Razr Ultra 2025 reviewer, Derrek Lee, concurs, saying that "opening the phone feels great, thanks to the new titanium-reinforced hinge" and adding that "it’s stronger and makes it easier to open the Razr Ultra with one hand."</p><p>I've been testing the base-model Razr 2025, which also has the brand-new titanium hinge, and agree on all counts. It's satisfying enough to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-makes-me-and-my-razr-plus-2023-jealous">base Razr 2025 a key upgrade over my Razr Plus 2023</a>.</p>

The phone is currently the most powerful flip phone on the market, with specs that rival even more traditional premium flagships like the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And with a price that matches Samsung’s top-of-the-line model for 2025, Motorola seems to have a lot of confidence in the Razr Ultra 2025 following the line’s success in recent years.</p><p>But is Motorola <em>too </em>confident in the Razr Ultra? Does the company have what it takes to charge Samsung-level prices for a phone? I’ve spent a week with the Razr Ultra 2025, and while my thoughts are <em>mostly</em> final, this is how my time with the phone has been and why I think it deserves your consideration.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">announced</a> on April 24 and preorders began on May 7, with open sale starting on May 15 in the United States. Two configurations are available: 16GB+512GB ($1,299) and 16GB+1TB ($1,499, only at Motorola.com).</p><p>The phone comes in four different color options, courtesy of Pantone: Scarab (Altandara), Rio Red, Cabaret, and Mountain Trail (wood). Availability will depend on the retailer and carrier.</p>

<p>If you’ve followed the Razr series for the past few years, then the design of the Razr Ultra 2025 shouldn’t surprise you. It looks nearly identical to its predecessor, which in this case would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, sporting the same curved frame, rounded corners, and massive cover panel. The differences lie in the slightly larger display size, the new materials on the back, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">IP48 water and dust resistance</a> for improved durability.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Razr Ultra 2025 color options</a> are quite interesting this year, as Motorola continues to move away from muted shades. I have the Rio Red color on my unit, which incorporates Motorola’s now-standard vegan leather and is admittedly the least interesting Razr Ultra 2025 color. I previously spent some time with the soft Alcantara and the hardy wood finishes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">during my hands-on</a>, and I must say, Motorola has given users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">quite the selection of sensory goodies</a> to choose from.</p><p>I also like that Motorola switched from a glossy frame to brushed metal, as it gives the overall design a rustic sheen.</p>

<p>Opening the phone feels great, thanks to the new titanium-reinforced hinge. It’s stronger and makes it easier to open the Razr Ultra with one hand. It almost springs open with a satisfying click, which sounds about as good as it does when closing the phone.</p><p>When the phone is open, you’re greeted with a 7-inch OLED display that looks much punchier than previous models. This is likely a result of the Pantone collaboration, which aims to provide "authentic and vivid images." The sharper Super HD resolution also makes content look crisper, while the variable 165Hz refresh rate helps make UI elements move with a slick, buttery smoothness.</p>

<p>Motorola gives you three display presets for how it displays colors: Natural, Radiant, and Vivid. I would suggest Radiant, as it splits the diff and gives you a bit more vibrancy without overdoing it. There are also a few settings for eye protection, including Flicker prevention for users with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>, which is nice to see as Motorola continues improving the overall quality of its displays.</p>

It may seem like overkill, and it probably is, but the result is the kind of performance you’d expect from a top-tier flagship phone, as I experienced no lag or hiccups in my use.</p>

<p>Motorola managed to stuff a pretty large 4,700mAh battery into the Razr Ultra 2025, which should help offset the more powerful chipset and higher-resolution display. So far, I have no complaints with battery life, although my usage has been a little skewed as my testing has involved me using the phone more than usual. You’ll get a full day of use, and while I don’t imagine going beyond that, I plan to update this review with my findings as my usage patterns normalize.</p>

<p>Power users will enjoy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-charging-speed">68W charging</a>, which tops up the phone in roughly 40 minutes. Although I haven’t been able to test out the top 30W wireless charging speed, as all of mine top out at 15W, it’s good to see someone in the U.S., aside from OnePlus, moving the needle on charging speeds.</p>

<p>The Razr Ultra 2025 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and will receive three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which notably falls behind other flagship competitors. The latest version of Hello UX also isn’t much different from Motorola’s Android 14 software, although there are many Motorola or Razr-specific features sprinkled throughout.</p><p>The focus is on AI, and Motorola stuffed as much as it could into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> software, which feels like a much more mature and comprehensive offering than what was offered in last year's beta, with more easily accessible features that you can find in the dedicated Moto AI app. For example, notification summaries are available with the click of a button and are now actionable, and Moto AI will pull up contextual actions based on whatever’s on your screen when you trigger it, similar in a way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>.</p>

<p>Image Studio and Playlist Studio are fun ways to use AI to generate images and context-based music playlists (a feature YouTube Music should steal), although the latter is currently limited to Amazon Music, which I imagine won't do many people much good.</p><p>The Razr still features Gemini and some Google AI features to complement Moto AI. And unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, Moto AI isn’t injected into <em>every</em> aspect of the OS, which some may find refreshing. That said, there are many ways to trigger it, from the new dedicated AI button to double-tapping the back of the phone.</p>

<p>One of the coolest ways to trigger Moto AI is with Look & Talk. If the Razr Ultra 2025 is in Tent or Stand mode, all you have to do is look at it, and it will begin listening to you. You can also ask follow-up questions, but you’ll have to wait until it’s done speaking or press the mic icon to interrupt it. It’s not as seamless as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a>, which will let you interrupt it mid-sentence, and I hope Motorola will enable this in future updates.</p>

<p>Motorola partnered with as many companies as possible to give Moto AI on the Razr Ultra a unique edge, although I think the execution could use some work. For instance, you can ask Moto AI a question and then tap “Explore with Perplexity,” which is a nice way to get users to dive deeper into a topic, but I rarely found myself doing this.</p><p>I would like to see this type of visibility extended to other AI agents that consumers are likely more familiar with, such as Copilot, Meta AI, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. You can always <em>tell </em>Moto AI to “Ask Copilot” or the like, but I would be more inclined to press a button to “Explore with Gemini” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">than I would with Perplexity</a>, even if Motorola is throwing in a free Perplexity Pro trial. This would also just be a good way to visually show consumers that they have options aside from Perplexity.</p>

<p>The cover screen experience hasn’t changed much from the Razr Plus 2024, which is great. In fact, it got better with Android 15. Not only can you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">natively use apps on the cover screen</a>, but you can also press and hold for additional actions, and now even set shortcuts to certain app functions on the app panel for even faster access to things without opening the phone.</p>

<p>You can also set multiple app and widget panels, which can come in handy if you want separate app pages instead of scrolling through a single panel. That said, the overall functionality of using apps on the cover screen is still the same and remains one of my favorite ways to use the Razr.</p>

<hr>
<p>I plan to dive deeper into the cameras in a separate camera review, but for now, I can say that I’m pretty pleased with Motorola's improvements here. I much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">prefer the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor over the 2x telephoto sensor</a> on last year’s Razr Plus. This way, Motorola can have the best of both by utilizing the primary camera for some in-sensor zoom and an ultrawide sensor for group photos and macro shots.</p><p>Lo and behold, the Razr Ultra 2025 takes great photos from the primary sensor, even at 2x zoom. The colors feel much punchier than I’m used to seeing from Motorola, which is likely a product of the Pantone collaboration. Dynamic range also feels improved, with better handling of low-light and nighttime images. The result is images that feel more Samsung in terms of color and saturation, while the added depth and definition remind me a bit of a Pixel.</p><p>I wouldn’t say image quality is anywhere near the impressive quality of the cameras on OPPO, OnePlus, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo</a> phones, but so far, I feel pretty confident that the Razr Ultra 2025 can compete fairly comfortably among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best Android cameras</a>.</p>

<p>Motorola also includes some AI tricks to help users customize how the camera handles colors based on the subject, which is a neat way to personalize the camera experience. That includes Action Shot for fast-moving subjects, Group Shot, which is Motorola's version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>, and the new Air gestures for controlling video capture without touching the phone.</p><p>Video capture also feels quite improved from previous models, thanks to better color reproduction and overall more stable recording, even at 4K60 or 8K30.</p>

<p>In North America, the Ultra's only competition is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, Samsung's model from 2024. It's a great phone overall, thanks to the powerful Snapdragon chipset, great battery life, solid set of cameras, and long software support. However, given that it's last year's model, performance will likely not match the newer Snapdragon chip from Qualcomm.</p><p>In a way, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is also a direct competitor, as the Razr Ultra specs and price more closely match Samsung's best. It gets a slightly beefier Snapdragon chip, more camera lenses, and a more robust software offering. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-color-should-you-buy">color options</a> aren't as interesting, it has less RAM, and it charges much more slowly.</p><p>Other notable flip phones include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Xiaomi Mix Flip</a>, which also has a large cover screen, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">TECNO Phantom V Flip 2</a>, which aims for the lower-end with a more affordable price point.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a powerful flagship Android phone with plenty of AI experiences.</li><li>You want a versatile camera with a large cover screen viewfinder.</li><li>You want good battery life, fast charging, and a very useful cover screen.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn’t buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a long and reliable software update promise.</li><li>You want a dedicated telephoto camera for enhanced zoom.</li><li>You don’t want to spend more than $999 for a smartphone (may be worth waiting).</li></ul>
<p>Motorola may thrive in the midrange with phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-hands-on">Moto G Stylus 2025</a>, but the company is clearly feeling itself with the Razr. The Razr Ultra 2025 represents the absolute best of Motorola, from its iconic design to its impressive specs and a fun suite of AI features.</p><p>The partnership with Pantone is clearly paying off, as evident by the display and camera improvements, while the Snapdragon 8 Elite gives the Razr a new edge as a premium Android smartphone.</p><p>Of course, the price tag may be hard for some to justify, and the update promise could be better if you don’t plan on upgrading in the next three or four years. However, I feel like the positives easily outweigh the negatives and the Razr Ultra 2025 is easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a>… no, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best <em>phones </em>of 2025</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm's latest midrange chip, the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4, is here with improved AI and processing capabilities.</li><li>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 mobile platform is a 4nm processor with the latest connectivity specifications, like Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6.0.</li><li>This processor will first launch on phones from Honor and Vivo this month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm is upgrading its midrange chip offerings with the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4, a processor with improved AI performance, better image-signal processing, and support for newer connectivity standards. The chipset will first launch in Honor and Vivo midrangers expected to be announced this month, Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-7-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-7-gen-4-mobile-platform" target="_blank">announced</a> in a press release today, May 15.</p><p>The last refresh of the Snapdragon 7 series arrived with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, announced in November 2023. That's the processor the new Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 replaces, and the time between releases allowed Qualcomm to deliver a handful of key improvements. Compared to the prior generation, the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 performs 27% better in CPU performance, 30% better in GPU performance, and 65% better in AI performance.</p><p>The Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 mobile platform uses the Qualcomm Hexagon NPU with dedicated NPUs for audio and sensors. The drastically improved AI performance utilizes the Qualcomm AI Engine for on-device processing, with deep integration throughout the system-on-a-chip. That includes everything from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound">Snapdragon Sound</a> audio to image-signal processing. On top of that, the chip adds Qualcomm Expanded Personal Area Network (XPAN) support for audio listening for the first time.</p>

<p>Qualcomm is still using a 4nm fabrication process for the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4, the same as the prior generation. However, the newer chipset has a revamped configuration, with one Prime core with a faster 2.8GHz clock speed, four performance cores clocked at up to 2.4GHz, and three efficiency cores clocked at up to 1.8GHz. Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a> processor, the latest version has a higher-clocked Prime core and an extra performance, with one fewer efficiency core.</p><p>Rounding out the chip's upgrades are connectivity improvements across the board, with 3GPP Release 17 5G support, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7 support</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bluetooth-6">Bluetooth 6.0 support</a>. That can result in peak W-Fi speeds of up to 5.8 Gbps, up from 2.9 Gbps on the Wi-Fi 6E-only Snapdragon 7 Gen 3.</p><p>Qualcomm's partner OEMs praised the new chipset in a press release, teasing the upcoming products that the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chip will power.</p><p>"This powerful platform will enable us to deliver unparalleled performance and cutting-edge features, elevating our users’ mobile experiences in their daily lives," said Fei Fang, who is the president of products at Honor. "We are excited to collaborate closely with Qualcomm Technologies and integrate the new Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 mobile platform into our upcoming commercial device."</p><p>Unconfirmed leaks have claimed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/the-honor-400-lite-5g-is-iphone-copying-gone-too-far">Honor 400</a> and the Vivo S30 could be the first phones to sport Qualcomm's new midrange mobile platform. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-series-launching-globally-may-22">Honor 400 series is launching on May 22</a>.</p>

The Air 3S provide a 201-inch micro-OLED panel that you can take anywhere, and they have much better sound than previous models.</p><p>While fringing was an issue in the past, RayNeo made considerable progress in this area, and it wasn't as big a problem on the Air 3S. The glasses are lighter as well, and they get 3840Hz DC dimming along with a new image engine with better colors. The glasses connect to just about any USB-C device, and I didn't see any issues using it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> and Steam Deck.</p><p>The best part is the value; these glasses undercut their rivals considerably, and if you're interested in XR glasses to deliver better immersion while gaming or watching movies, the Air 3S are a great starting point.</p>

<p>RayNeo launched the Air 3S on March 15, 2025, and the XR glasses are now available globally. They retail <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/2025-New-RayNeo-Air-Glasses/dp/B0DZ2RQSC5">for just $239 on Amazon</a> as of writing (including a $30 code), and the standard package includes the glasses and a carrying case.</p><p>RayNeo also sells a bundle that includes its Pocket TV accessory, and it's basically a portable Google TV device with a built-in battery that lets you view content without your phone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Air-Glasses-Pocket-Bundle/dp/B0F3D13XCY">bundle comes out to $322</a>, and I recommend getting it if you intend to primarily stream TV shows and movies with the device.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-rayneo-air-3s-design"><span>RayNeo Air 3S: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ex9gpGjyEPHYvpF7FjzRqK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ex9gpGjyEPHYvpF7FjzRqK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RayNeo retained the same overall design for the Air 3S, but the glasses now get a silver frame that looks much better. They're made out of plastic, and going this route allowed RayNeo to save weight, with the glasses coming in at just 76g. That's a smidgen lighter than the Air 2S (78g), and the lightweight frame is comfortable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="roTgjCpjD6v655KCSB9RaK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roTgjCpjD6v655KCSB9RaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's good weight balance, and you get decent adjustability with three angles to select from. That said, it takes a little bit of work to get a comfortable fit; I had to adjust the nose bridge and the positioning of the frame several times before I was able to use these glasses for any extended amount of time, and even then, they didn't quite fit right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MNgy5DcwBuQEnoivdibbbK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MNgy5DcwBuQEnoivdibbbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The glasses don't exert too much pressure on the nose or ears — RayNeo did a decent job distributing the weight of the glasses evenly across the body. However, the design and sizing of the glasses can lead to fatigue with extended use; my colleague Nick Sutrich also tested the Air 3S, and he wasn't able to get a comfortable fit, leading to strain with just 30 minutes of usage.</p><p>So if you've got your eye on these, I highly recommend trying out the glasses to see if you can get a good fit, as that makes all the difference.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-rayneo-air-3s-features-and-real-world-testing"><span>RayNeo Air 3S: Features and real-world testing</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qgyYTybazSrFrC6dR4rJZK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qgyYTybazSrFrC6dR4rJZK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Air 3S retains the same control mechanism as the Air 2 and 2S; you get a brightness slider on the right, and the menu button and volume key on the left. The menu lets you switch between 60Hz and 120Hz, and there are four picture modes available: Standard, Game, Movie, and Eye Protection. I found the Movie mode to deliver the best color fidelity, and the Eye Protection mode switches to a warmer profile.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WWuFH7GE3LAN8LVhJcqhbK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWuFH7GE3LAN8LVhJcqhbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The inclusion of 3840Hz DC dimming means you don't have to deal with flicker, and that's a notable differentiator on these glasses. Another advantage is the sound; thanks to a quartet of audio drivers, the Air 3S produces immersive sound that gets astonishingly loud. There's also a quiet mode that prevents sound leakage, and it is pretty nifty if you're using these glasses outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uvY5vLKzofeYcnQrtauGpK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvY5vLKzofeYcnQrtauGpK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the front shade of the glasses is darkened, but it doesn't block out the world; if you're outdoors or in a room with a lot of ambient light, you will notice light leakage through the glasses. Other brands use electrochromic lenses that let you adjust the level of darkness, but as the Air 3S is aimed at the budget segment, it misses out on this mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EFL2txmzBjsrRCz5MZ92pK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EFL2txmzBjsrRCz5MZ92pK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RayNeo bundles a hard shell case with the Air 3S, and it has a mesh pocket that holds the provided USB-C cable. Connecting the glasses to a USB-C device is as straightforward as it gets; just plug in the angled end of the USB-C cable to the Air 3S, and the other side to the source device. I used the glasses predominantly with my Steam Deck, but I didn't see any issues connecting to my Vivo X200 Pro or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L6Dd9vQdjN2zNvgkCvqDdK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L6Dd9vQdjN2zNvgkCvqDdK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it misses out on some of the extras you get with AR glasses, the Air 3S is a terrific choice if you're looking to play games or stream content. The 201-inch micro-OLED panel has vibrant colors, and it gets very bright. RayNeo is using a new image engine, and there's a noticeable difference in color balance against the Air 2S.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LmiiiuySmpF65CQAGJvuoK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmiiiuySmpF65CQAGJvuoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The glasses truly shine when gaming; playing Hades while connected to the Steam Deck was thoroughly enjoyable, and the ease of use is a definite plus point. The onboard sound is detailed, and while my usage of XR glasses is limited to RayNeo's products, the Air 3S sounds better than its predecessors.</p>

<p>Xreal's One smart glasses are the standard in this category, and they have an elegant design with a better panel. They don't look quite as outlandish as the Air 3S, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Glasses-Renowned-Adjustable-Transparency/dp/B0DNFFXG65">coming in at $499</a>, they cost twice as much.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want XR glasses that are a good value</li><li>You need a high-quality panel</li><li>You want good color vibrancy and eye comfort features</li><li>You need XR glasses with good built-in sound</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best comfort</li></ul>
<p>RayNeo understands this market well, and by selling the Air 3S at just $239, it is effectively undercutting every other brand. The XR glasses excel at the basics; you get a bright 201-inch projection with great colors and contrast, useful eye protection features, and detailed sound.</p><p>The fit is problematic, and using the glasses outdoors is a bit of a hassle as you don't get a fully tinted shade, but the pros significantly outweigh the cons. These glasses are particularly great if you're looking to play on the Steam Deck or Switch while on the go, and they're just as versatile with multimedia content.</p><p>Ultimately, it's the value that gives the Air 3S a definite edge; they're affordable enough that you can easily try out the glasses and see if they hold up to your intended use case.</p>

Now, it's bringing both features together into the Amp Ultra, delivering the best features of the Ultra alongside amplification. The Amp Ultra provides 100W to each channel into 8 ohms, and 200W a channel at 4 ohms thanks to the use of two TI TPA3255 Class-D amp chips and six TI OPA1612 op-amps.</p><p>WiiM retained a similar design as the Ultra, and the aluminum housing along with the sleek chassis make it look as elegant as Apple's high-end products. Connectivity includes HDMI ARC, USB-A to connect drives, optical, RCA, and subwoofer out. The DAC is an ESS ES9039Q2M, and it has 384kHz/32-bit decode.</p>

<p>The Amp Ultra has a 3.5-inch screen that lets you control the device, and it has most major music streaming protocols, including Spotify Connect, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, Alexa, DLNA, and Roon. What's interesting is that you also get automatic room correction, and I'm intrigued in seeing how it holds up.</p>
<p>WiiM also showcased the Sound, a smart speaker that's touted with "exceptional audio fidelity" and all the smarts that are standard in WiiM's other products. WiiM is positioning multi-room audio and high-res listening as a differentiator, and it's clear to see that the brand is going after Sonos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="cTUdGGHrbQuQTRxje7DfK3" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cTUdGGHrbQuQTRxje7DfK3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WiiM)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Sound provides 100W of power via a 4-inch sub and dual tweeters, and it also gets room correction along with stereo pairing. It has Google Assistant (soon to be Gemini) integration as well as Alexa, and includes Spotify Connect, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, and DLNA.</p>
<p>That's not all; WiiM is also debuting a subwoofer dubbed the Sub Pro. It delivers 250W of power via an 8-inch driver, and seamlessly integrates with the rest of the brand's products. It has a sleeker design than most subwoofers around, and it has RCA if you're connecting it to your existing audio system.</p><p>The only drawback is that we'll need to wait until Q3 to know what the Amp Ultra, Sound, and Sub Pro will cost. I've enjoyed using the WiiM Amp and Pro Plus quite a bit, and I'm excited to see what these products have to offer.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-67">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Max is ditching the “Max” name and going back to HBO Max this summer—less than two years after switching it up.</li><li>This will be the second time the service has changed its name in just three years—first launched as HBO Max in 2020, replacing HBO Now and separate from HBO Go.</li><li>The company is focusing on high-quality TV over a massive library.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced that Max is getting its old name back. The streaming service is heading back to being called HBO Max, like it never left.</p><p>Just two years after ditching the HBO Max name, it’s coming back. At Wednesday’s Upfront event, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the switch will happen this summer.</p><p>The upcoming name change marks the platform's second identity crisis in just three years. Back in May 2020, when it was still under WarnerMedia, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming service</a> launched as HBO Max, replacing HBO Now (its standalone streaming option since 2014) while keeping it separate from HBO Go (its old cable-authenticated VOD service that's since been retired).</p>
<h2 id="more-content-wasn-t-the-answer-2">"More content" wasn’t the answer</h2>
<p>At launch, WarnerMedia promised HBO Max would deliver everything HBO has to offer and then some.</p><p>HBO Max also packed in content from the rest of WarnerMedia’s lineup, including DC Comics, Cartoon Network, and more. Still, the real hook was being able to stream HBO’s top-shelf lineup without needing cable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5841px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="GPK9z4UGayCni8ZMgixRbQ" name="HBO-Max-Discovery-Plus-2.jpg" alt="HBO Max and Discovery Plus logos side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GPK9z4UGayCni8ZMgixRbQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5841" height="3286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Max <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/hbo-max-is-officially-just-max-what-this-means-for-you">ditched the HBO name in 2023</a>, it left everyone scratching their heads. Suddenly, apps on platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> showed up as just "Max," confusing subscribers who wondered where their HBO content went.</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery claimed that the goal was to broaden the brand's appeal beyond just HBO's prestige TV crowd. No more HBO in the name meant the service could push reality shows, kids' content, and blockbuster movies without feeling tied to HBO's highbrow reputation.</p>
<h2 id="a-lesson-in-brand-loyalty-2">A lesson in brand loyalty</h2>
<p>Turns out, viewers weren’t shy about hating the name change. Despite Warner Bros. Discovery’s grand plans, dropping HBO rubbed fans the wrong way, and many saw it as ditching the prestige that made the platform special in the first place.</p><p>Now, the company is course-correcting. Instead of chasing a "quantity over quality" approach with a sprawling library of random content, it's doubling down on high-end, must-watch TV.</p><p>Bringing back the HBO name is a key move in Warner Bros. Discovery’s plan to grow its global subscriber base. The company believes that reintroducing the HBO brand on Max will make it crystal clear to subscribers what kind of high-quality content they can expect.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fitbit is detailing an expansion of its experimental card for interested users, which involves a brighter spotlight on your health.</p><p>Detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/The-Pulse-Fitbit-Community-Blog/See-what-s-new-for-Fitbit-Labs/ba-p/5750673#M318">blog post</a>, Fitbit Labs is introducing three new tests for interested users. The first is called "Medical Record Navigator," which leverages Gemini for "clear health summaries." Fitbit says this feature can turn your "complicated lab reports" into more understandable overviews. Gemini is the key player here, condensing all that information, so you know where you stand.</p><p>Fitbit states it will also link users to "educational resources" about the data returned.</p><p>The post states the Medical Record Navigator will roll into the Labs experience in the mobile app "later this week." Users will be able to sign up/enroll and begin "securely uploading" their lab reports into Fitbit's navigator.</p><p>The second and third tests almost go hand-in-hand, with the first stated to be the "Symptom Checker" experiment. Through this, Fitbit says users can "describe" what they're feeling, like if they're head hurts. The company says the app "may" ask you some follow-up questions to better understand what's wrong.</p><p>The provided answers will be analyzed so the app can deliver potential reasons behind why you feel bad. This test is slated to begin "in the coming weeks."</p>
<h2 id="fitbit-labs-furthering-health-awareness-2">Fitbit Labs, furthering health awareness</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="sLkyDEujbGwJJKYeMt7nUW" name="google-pixel-watch-3-readiness-score.jpg" alt="Morning Brief Readiness Score on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLkyDEujbGwJJKYeMt7nUW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The final upcoming test is "Unusual Trends." This one is more of a background, watchful eye on your health. Fitbit states that once you've enrolled, Unusual Trends will figure out "what's normal for you." After that, it will continue to monitor your health data for changes that could signal something that requires your attention.</p><p>Fitbit says you'll be alerted if your data begins to "trend away from your baseline." The post adds that certain changes could be indicative of sickness or stress. Either way, if something falls out of the norm, you'll (ideally) know about it.</p><p>Like the Symptom Checker, Fitbit Labs' Unusual Trends is set to arrive in the coming weeks.</p><p>Another significant Fitbit Labs addition was introduced in March, as the app gave testers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/fitbit-labs-personal-sleep-schedule-test-reported">the Sleep Schedule experiment</a>. In short, the feature's purpose is to help users get an optimal amount of sleep, especially if you've been feeling tired. Sleep Schedule will feed multiple surveys throughout the day, from morning to afternoon and evening. The surveys will help the app understand what might be impacting your sleep, like noise, light, or perhaps the time you're going to bed.</p><p>As always, users can find current Fitbit Labs tests in the "You" and "Today" tabs. Users can participate or hop onto the waitlist.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-malware-2">What is malware?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="Uf3njLayCGX27JxWv92uhV" name="Android-Malware-1.jpg" alt="Malware" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uf3njLayCGX27JxWv92uhV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You know it's something bad, but do you really know what malware is? It's probably not exactly what you're thinking.</p><p>Malware is defined as any software designed to disrupt or exploit a device, a network, or data on either. Some shady bootleg app that steals your bank info is malware, but under this definition, so is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-dont-know-what-id-do-without-chromes-autofill-feature">Chrome</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-edge-officially-launches-ios-and-android">Microsoft Edge</a>. You need to go one step further and describe malware as a thing that does this without your permission.</p><p>The easiest way to describe it is with a simple example: a boring flashlight app. You download and install a flashlight app to do only one thing: turn on your camera flash when you tap the icon. To do this, the app only needs access to the basics — an ability to take user input and send a request to toggle the flash on and off.</p><p>Now imagine the same app, but this time it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/problem-android-permissions-too-much-information-and-not-enough-information-all-once">wants to access your contacts</a>. It doesn't offer any sort of community access to your camera flash and doesn't have a reason for doing it. It just does and you have no idea why. That's malware. It's planning on doing something with your data, maybe in the future, but the important thing is that it's trying to do things it doesn't need to do. Substitute any other data for your contacts and the situation is the same.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-malware-spread-2">How does malware spread?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="eMSaRfNunXs6FzUUxTuhoS" name="Android-Malware-4.jpg" alt="Sandboxed permissions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMSaRfNunXs6FzUUxTuhoS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Thankfully, it's very difficult for any application to do what's described above in secret. Unfortunately, it probably doesn't need to be secretive because you never looked to see what else the app tells you it will do down in its fine print.</p><p>One way malware is distributed is by relying on you to accept all the things an app can do without reading anything. However, this method only works for apps that follow the complicated and often silly platform distribution rules. And yes, that flashlight app scenario happened on both Android and iOS, in each official app store; it followed the rules, so it was allowed to at the time.</p><p>Social engineering (getting you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/read-the-fine-print">click yes, knowing you won't read it all</a> is social engineering at the lowest level) is probably the most common way to spread malware. If I can build an app that does things it shouldn't, I still would need a way to have you install it.</p><p>Trickery works because most people don't realize the harm that can arise from their simple actions. You can compromise your information, your friends and family's information, and even the information of other devices using the same network as you. All you have to do is click yes.</p><p>A scarier way of spreading malware is by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-zero-day-exploit-february-2024-detailed">exploiting bugs in your phone's OS</a> and installing software without your knowledge. Maybe you visit the wrong website, try pirating sites for "free" paid apps, or even connect to the wrong open Wi-Fi network. These are ways malware can find its way onto your device.</p><p>Once in place, this sort of malware can cause serious issues. Governments of the world even try it, so it can monitor the people they think need to be monitored because it's powerful and usually undetectable.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-try-and-prevent-all-this-2">What can I do to try and prevent all this?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rqNR9WF3NtKSHhQjGZgYqM" name="OnePlus-9-Google-Play-Store-logo-16x9-hero.JPG" alt="Google Play Store on OnePlus 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rqNR9WF3NtKSHhQjGZgYqM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, it's not that difficult to protect yourself. You could install one of the many malware scanners available and hope it catches any and everything, but you also need to follow a few simple rules if you just want things to be easy and malware-free.</p><p><strong>Only use the official app store that came with your phone. </strong>Your phone comes with at least one way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-apps">find and install apps</a> to do fun and cool things with. These stores aren't perfect, but they are a million times better at catching and removing malware before it can get to you than any other distribution model.</p><p>Apple tests every app before it's placed in the store, while Google makes sure the app follows the rules before it's made available, and then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">scans every app</a> before it gets installed on your phone. Samsung, Epic, and other app markets also have safeguards in place to make sure they aren't spreading bad apps.</p><p><strong>Never click yes before you read what you're agreeing to.</strong> This can't be stressed enough! These user agreements are terrible and often full of language designed to give one party an advantage in the case of a dispute, but force yourself to read through them every single time. You might not like your options; you'll either need to agree to the terms presented or not use an app, a service, or even a device itself.</p><p>Nobody wants to put their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> back in the box to send to Samsung because they don't want Samsung to analyze the way they use it, but those are the rules. Once you've said yes, they can and will do what they asked permission to do. Make sure you're OK with it all by reading what is put in front of you.</p><p>(<em>Editor's note: You can trust companies like Samsung, Apple, or even Google to do only what they say they will do with anything they collect from your phone, so don't let that scare you off.</em>)</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hq9ezpRjMLcmMnnwm3USyW" name="android-update-google-pixel-generic.jpg" alt="Android System Update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hq9ezpRjMLcmMnnwm3USyW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Alex Dobie / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Always accept updates.</strong> When you buy a device, you're given a promise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">software support for a specific amount of time</a>. A big part of that support is<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-may-2025-pixel-update-is-here"> patching the bugs and exploits</a> used to hijack your phone or install bad apps without your knowledge. Trust that companies like Google and Apple know what they are doing, but also accept that other smart people are trying to find ways to defeat every protection you have. Exploits will happen, and when those get patched, be sure to install the update right away.</p><p><strong>Never trust anything without verifying it first</strong>. This is the hardest part. Is that message really from your little brother asking for $200, or saying he forgot the gate code, or is it from someone else? Make sure. The same goes for any links you come across — are you sure you can trust them?</p><p>Be very cautious using public Wi-Fi networks, too. It's easy to make one (you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-mvnos-allow-tethering">do it right on your phone</a>!) and with the right tools, everything sent on them can be collected: passwords, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">2FA information</a>, credit card info, etc. Taking a minute to make sure you know the <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> is a lot easier than trying to fix everything after someone steals your identity or your credit card number.</p><p>Really, it's not as hard as it sounds to protect yourself. It's also not foolproof — anyone can end up with malware, even security professionals or government officials with security teams. Doing your part makes it a lot harder.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing's CEO, Carl Pei, confirmed that the Phone 3 is on the way this summer and will cost "somewhere around" £800 (~$1,062).</li><li>Pei highlights the Phone 3's usage of Android, and all of its upgraded features and security enhancements.</li><li>Nothing took a break in 2024, opting to refrain from a Phone 3 launch while it developed its AI software, which we've seen in full on the Phone 3a series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing is giving consumers their first major teaser drop about its next flagship phone launch.</p><p>Joining Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNR550z7xXU&ab_channel=Android">Android Show</a>, Nothing's CEO Carl Pei discussed what consumers can expect next: the Phone 3, and when. Pei announced that the Phone 3 will launch this summer. Pei states the company is "going all in" with the device, granting it "premium materials, major performance upgrades, and software that really levels things up."</p><p>More importantly, Pei clued consumers into its price, reportedly "somewhere around" £800 (~$1,062).</p><p>Pei adds that users will be given the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-show-io-2025-security-privacy-details">secure</a>" and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">upgraded Android experience</a> within its upcoming next-generation Nothing phone. The video then dips into Nothing's AI efforts. Pei states the company has worked with its community to create software that's "not just bolted on, but built in."</p><p>The company remains confident that its AI features will work with users, learning and adapting to who they are.</p>

<p>Those waiting on the Phone 3 can breathe easy now, especially after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">2024 came and went</a> without its appearance. That wasn't without reason, as Nothing prioritized developing its planned AI software over the flagship phone. At the time, Pei touted Nothing's AI as "highly personalized and dynamic." We've seen what the company was working on with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">the Phone 3a and 3a Pro</a>. Nothing introduced its "Essential Space," a suite of AI features to give users more utility in their daily lives.</p><p>The Essential Key, the series' new physical button, lets users quickly surface its AI features. Pressing that opens up the option to record voice notes or browse through your stored content.</p><p>On a more exciting note, Nothing's direct confirmation (price teaser) of the Phone 3 comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-emoji-teasers-impending-launch">quickly after its emoji teaser</a>. Last week, the company posted two emojis: a smartphone and the number three. We've been expecting the Phone 3 this year ever since the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">said as much in March</a>. The device is speculated to be a "milestone" for the company and will "100%" come to the U.S., per Pei.</p><p>A few rumors claim the device could feature a 6.5-inch display with the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC. But we're not far off now from its official arrival, where we'll know all its content for certain.</p>

<ul><li>A research report by BrightEdge states Google's AI Overviews have led to a 49% increase in search impressions.</li><li>The post states users are clicking-through less, likely due to AI Overviews appearing in roughly 11% of Search queries.</li><li>Google's AI Overviews storied history officially began in May 2024, which kicked off its citations update and its trouble with erroneous answers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Research was conducted on the effects Google's AI Overviews have on its Search ecosystem, and the results appear positive.</p><p>In a report by BrightEdge (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/14/3080918/0/en/One-Year-Into-Google-AI-Overviews-BrightEdge-Data-Reveals-Google-Search-Usage-Increases-by-49.html">Global Newswire</a>), its research reportedly concludes that Google's AI Overviews are mostly positive for it and the user experience. The founder and CEO of BrightEdge, Jim Yu, said, "The assumption was that AI would kill traditional search." Instead, these bite-sized AI notes have increased search impressions "by over 49%," to which Yu adds, "our data tells a different story: search is not disappearing, it’s expanding. Google is not being replaced; it’s being reimagined.:</p><p>The report breaks things down, stating AI Overviews now appear in "over 11%" of Google Search queries. Moreover, the company finds that users are clicking through results less because of this, with a ~30% decline in such behavior.</p><p>Citing sources is another topic Google has pushed with its AI Overviews, but it's not the only one doing this. As the post highlights, other companies like OpenAI with ChatGPT and Perplexity also deliver an "overview" variant. However, as it notes, each is different, with ChatGPT offering "rare" instances of citations. Perplexity is stated to step this up to roughly five citations per answer, yet it mostly skips out on brand names.</p><p>BrightEdge analysts claim Google sits between its competitors, offering a mix of brand names and citations that (hopefully) make sense.</p>

<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overview-save-feature-expansion">tested links</a> in AI Overviews <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-source-linking-generative-ai-search">a couple of different times</a>, as the software is prone to either hallucinating or flat-out getting things wrong. With in-line links, users can see clearly (and faster) where the AI got the information it's reciting. It also helps to retain the AI's credibility and gives users a chance to ensure they're not going around spouting nonsense either. Fact-checking has even hit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-for-students-educator-features-detailed">the likes of Gemini</a>.</p><p>However, AI Overviews didn't have a flawless first year, as you may remember the whole "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-head-of-search-ai-overview-fix-inbound">glue cheese on pizza</a>" thing. Reports piled in last spring with users showcasing the strange responses Google's AI Overviews provided. The issue prompted the company's Head of Search, Liz Reid, to speak out about them and the cause: "queries that people don’t commonly do"</p><p>Reid explained that when there isn't enough information for the AI to utilize, it creates an information gap. The AI scrambles and often digs up whatever it can to fulfill the query. Unfortunately, the AI dug into troll posts on the internet that were wrong, but it doesn't know that. Reid stated last year that Google would return to the kitchen to alter how the AI interprets "nonsensical" and "satirical" queries.</p><p>Let's not forget that the AI is drawing knowledge from us, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">so stop trolling</a>.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">officially launching</a> in May 2024 during I/O 2024, Google has continued to refine and expand its overviews. Most recently, in January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Overviews expanded to Circle to Search</a> for the Galaxy S25 series. These overviews include one-tap actions for users who find phone numbers, emails, and more.</p>

<ul><li>The Suunto Run is a budget AMOLED running watch that only weighs 36g with the strap.</li><li>It has dual-band GPS, an updated HR sensor, music storage, and new training tools like a smarter Track mode and Ghost Running.</li><li>It costs $249 / £199 and ships in four color options, with no subscription cost.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>When it comes to budget running watches for serious runners, the $249 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> and $229 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> have few rivals. But the new Suunto Run deserves to be in that conversation.</p><p>Announced on Tuesday, the $249 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.suunto.com/products/suunto-run-all-black">Suunto Run</a> has a 12-day battery life, an altimeter, and dual-band GPS that lasts 20 hours, beating the 11-day Forerunner 165 that only offers 17 hours of all-systems GNSS (meaning no dual-band mode).</p><p>While the $449 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-review">Suunto Race</a> offered 40 dual-band GPS hours, Suunto has revamped its newer models' GPS and optical HR sensors, so you're ironically paying less for better accuracy with the Run watch.</p><p>Weighing just 36g with its 22mm nylon band, plastic body, and steel bezel, the Suunto Run won't win any beauty pageants but will feel breezy on your wrist during runs. And its 1.32-inch, 466x466 AMOLED display is a visual upgrade on MIP watches like the PACE 3 in this range.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RPi7QyVRyhDjTHqX38uQUV" name="suunto-run-render" alt="Render of the Suunto Run showing different sports modes on the AMOLED display, the steel bezel, and the crown and buttons along the right side of the case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RPi7QyVRyhDjTHqX38uQUV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Suunto)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Suunto also cut offline maps, power meter support, and third-party SuuntoPlus apps from the Suunto Run, making the Race or Race S a better fit if you want all the bells and whistles. But breadcrumb navigation without topo maps is much easier to swallow on a $249 watch than on the $499 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Garmin Instinct 3</a>.</p><p>Plus, the Suunto Run adds some unique running tools, starting with a new Track Run mode that will map out and memorize your local track to provide better location accuracy during workouts. The Ghost Runner mode lets you race past times or your friends' times on a certain route, while the marathon widget provides a real-time estimated finish time so you can tweak your pace as you run.</p><p>You can store up to 4GB of music on the Suunto Run, though you'll need your own MP3 files. Most running brands besides Garmin aren't able to support major music apps like Spotify, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The Suunto Run gives runners a 7-day training load widget, your fitness progress (akin to VO2 Max), and a recovery widget that helps guide your future training, though no suggested daily workouts or imported plans. It's best suited for self-guided runners who might pay for TrainingPeaks but don't need their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a> to hand-hold them through the workout.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Forerunner 165 does have suggested workouts, Garmin Coach, and recovery data, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-want-to-swap-my-garmin-forerunner-965-for-165-and-why-i-cant">blocks training load</a> to upsell you to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>. The COROS PACE 3 does have training load and importable training plans, but a duller screen and fewer dual-band GPS hours.</p><p>We look forward to testing the Suunto Run against these two watches, which showed great accuracy in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">cheap running watch test</a>. But strictly on paper, the Suunto Run sounds like a great deal with only a few compromises that some runners won't live without.</p>

It begins this week with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">The Android Show</a> and culminates in the usual set of festivities next week, starting Tuesday, May 20. It'll be easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">watch Google I/O 2025</a> from afar, but attendees are getting something special if Android president Sameer Samat has anything to say about it.</p><p>As The Android Show 2025 wrapped up, Samat put on what appeared to be a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">Google and Samsung's upcoming smart glasses</a>, complete with tinted lenses. As Samat put on the glasses, he teased that Google I/O 2025 would be full of more Android announcements, "and maybe even a few more really cool Android demos." Clearly, we're getting an up-close look at Google and Samsung's new smart glasses this year.</p><p>You can see the moment in the video below at the 20:27 timestamp.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3yDd3CmA_Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

<p>My biggest takeaway from this brief moment is that Google looks to be making glasses with different style options, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>. The frames look to be roughly the same size as Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a>, with temple arms slightly thicker than a standard pair of Ray-Bans. I made a quick side-by-side of me wearing the transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses next to Samat wearing the upcoming Google Smart Glasses.</p><p>We most recently saw these glasses at TED 2025, where Google product leads debuted features like live translation, Gemini integration, and the ultra-futuristic memory feature that can remember where you left items, like your keys. Those glasses had transparent lenses, though, while the pair Samat is wearing has full tinting.</p><p>There's no release date for these glasses yet, but they are thought to be made by Samsung and currently called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses" target="_blank">Project HAEAN</a>. They are scheduled to launch later this year alongside Samsung's mixed reality headset.</p>

<p>It's widely expected that Google will deliver substantial info on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, the new version of Android meant for smart glasses, VR headsets, and more, at Google I/O 2025. Google initially revealed Android XR back in December <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">at a special event</a>, detailing the basic UI and showing off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> headset for the first time publicly.</p><p>And while the headset itself promises to deliver cutting-edge visuals and a new UI built from the ground up for the Gemini era, it's the smart glasses that many people seem to be most excited about.</p><p>Google Glass debuted well over a decade ago and caught many people's attention, and while that product was well ahead of its time, Google has learned a thing or two about XR since then.</p><p>Google's smart glasses are said to have a small screen in the lens, similar to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses 3</a>. While you can see things on the screen, it's likely that Google wants users to directly interact with the glasses by using Gemini, while Meta is using a hybrid model where Meta AI drives some interaction, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">a wearable wristband</a> lets users directly interact with the UI using hand gestures.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> on Tuesday (May 13), and it brings in a host of new features, including enhancements to Find My Device.</p><p>According to Google, the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dont-get-lost-set-find-my-device-soon-you-get-your-phone">Find My Device</a> is seeing an evolution into Find Hub, making the process of locating belongings, family, and friends even easier.</p><p>The search giant will also be bringing new nearby finding capabilities with UWB-enabled tags — and Moto Tag is believed to be the first product to feature the functionality.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/locate-lost-belongings-find-hub/">evolution of Find Hub</a> also comprises the integration of satellite connectivity, which is said to help users stay connected with friends and family even when they aren’t around any cellular connectivity.</p><p>Google is aiming to make traveling even smoother. The company is all set to increase its partnerships with prominent airlines that will allow users to easily share their Bluetooth tag’s location with the airlines in order to recover their lost luggage hassle-free. The suggested partnerships are expected to see the light of day by early next year, which should come in handy for all those travel enthusiasts out there.</p>

<h2 id="part-of-android-16-revamp-2">Part of Android 16 revamp</h2>
<p>Users will also be expecting more personalization options going forward with the Find Hub. It ties in with the customization that is coming to Android 16 with the new Material 3 Expressive introduced by Google on Tuesday (May 13) with an aim to make the usage of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> (with Wear OS) “fluid, personal, and glanceable.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google I/O event, aka <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/the-android-show-i-o-special-live-blog-everything-coming-to-android-16">The Android Show</a>, has also focused on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show">expansion of Gemini Live</a> across the ecosystem. It means Google Assistant will entirely be replaced by Gemini Live on Android phones, wearables (via Wear OS), cars (through Android Auto), TVs (via Google TV), and XR (Android XR). The suggested integration would further focus on intuitive, hands-free, and context-aware AI assistance presumably superior than Google Assistant.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-97">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung's limited-edition Galaxy Ring looks fresh with a "Two-Tone Titanium Black" color combo (Titanium Black + Titanium Silver), but the tech inside is the same as previous versions.</li><li>Right now, the ring's only available at that one store, and no word on how many are up for grabs.</li><li>You can snag it at the Samsung Gangnam store, or get it with the S25 Edge for 20% off and KRW 100,000 ($70) in Samsung points.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">pulled back the curtain on the Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, but  that wasn’t the only surprise it had up its sleeve. Tucked into the buzz around its South Korean launch was something a little extra for wearable fans: a limited-edition colorway of the Galaxy Ring.</p><p>According to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1%ec%a0%84%ec%9e%90-%ea%b0%a4%eb%9f%ad%ec%8b%9c-s25-%ec%97%a3%ec%a7%80-%ea%b3%b5%ea%b0%9c" target="_blank">Korean website</a>, the new Galaxy Ring is pretty much the same tech-wise as its past versions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-limited-edition-two-tone-color-announced/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). The real standout is its fresh look.</p><p>Samsung calls it "Two-Tone Titanium Black," a smooth mix of the classic Titanium Black and Titanium Silver. There are no photos of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> yet, but it's clear the company is going for a premium vibe here.</p>
<h2 id="bundle-and-save-2">Bundle and save</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KMbUhCn4bUehTLkmfqKTya" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-inside-close.jpg" alt="Looking at the electronics on the inside of the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMbUhCn4bUehTLkmfqKTya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting tomorrow, you can grab this exclusive smart ring at the Samsung Gangnam flagship store, alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>While you can buy the ring solo, bundling it with the Edge gets you a sweet 20% discount on the ring and adds KRW 100,000 (approximately $70) worth of Samsung membership points.</p><p>Sadly, this unique ring is only available at one location for now. Samsung hasn’t revealed how many of these limited-edition pieces are up for grabs. Here’s hoping it'll rethink the strategy and make this cool design available to more countries soon.</p>
<h2 id="same-tech-fresh-drip-2">Same tech, fresh drip</h2>
<p>Aside from the fresh look, the limited-edition Galaxy Ring's core design stays the same, meaning no new features to speak of.</p><p>The existing lineup comes in Titanium Silver, Titanium Gold, and Titanium Black, with sizes ranging from 5 to 15. If you’re unsure about your size, Samsung’s got you covered with a free sizing kit when you order.</p>

From epic trade-in opportunities to free storage upgrades and beyond, keep reading for the best ways to save cash on this Samsung phone before it hits store shelves on May 30th. So far, I&apos;ve seen offers like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-edge/buy/galaxy-s25-edge-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-s937uzsexaa/"><strong>$800 off with eligible trade-in at Samsung</strong></a>, or this Verizon deal that gets you the Edge for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge/"><strong>FREE if you add a line and trade in an eligible device</strong></a>. Not too shabby for a phone that isn&apos;t even out yet!</p><p>In case you missed the big announcement yesterday, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> boasts most of the same great specs found in the rest of the S25 series — including a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and all the latest AI-boosted software features — and packs them into an unbelievably thin, lightweight device. The only catch is that this lightweight build comes at the expense of battery life. Still, the S25 Edge is destined to earn a place among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released this year, and thanks to the following preorder deals, you might get it for pretty cheap too.  </p>

<ul><li>A report claims Meta is pushing ahead with its planned 2026 smart glasses, which could upgrade Live AI to last longer.</li><li>The company is also looking into "super sensing," which is a host of AI features that could include facial recognition software.</li><li>A previous report detailed Meta's plans for its Hypernova glasses, which are reportedly preparing to debut in 2025 with a singular display on its right lens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New reports claim Meta's next planned pair of smart glasses could take its AI facial recognition to new heights.</p><p>Word about what Meta's next smart glasses could provide stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-renews-work-facial-recognition-tech-privacy-worries-fade">The Information</a>, who state there's a wealth of AI behind the lenses (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/next-gen-ray-ban-meta-2026-super-sensing-facial-recognition-live-ai/">UploadVR</a>). According to the report, Meta is supposedly pursuing an upgraded version of its "Live AI." Per the publication, Live AI is being looked at for Meta's 2026 smart glasses, and is designed to "see what its user does and responds in real-time, for hours."</p><p>This is designed to offer quick, hands-free help for users without needing to call the AI forward with its voice prompt. However, reports add that Meta is also looking into facial recognition software for its next glasses.</p><p>This feature is reportedly under Meta's internal "super sensing" codename. The post cites sources close to the matter who claim the company wants its super-sensing to boost the "popularity" of its products. Here's the thing about super sensing: it would enable the smart glasses to keep their cameras and sensors active at all times.</p><p>What's more, sources allege the AI would "remember" what all it saw (through the user).</p><p>The AI could even recognize certain important items like, say, your car or home keys. If this sounds familiar, it's because Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">demoed such a feature</a> for Android XR called "memory." The folks at UploadVR speculate this facial recognition could enable the AI to surface the name of someone you're speaking to. This is likely based on stored information the glasses have from the user.</p>
<h2 id="hypernova-beyond-2">Hypernova & Beyond</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are, of course, privacy concerns with an AI that's always active, viewing what you're doing in your daily life. The report suggests this feature will be an "opt-in" feature that users can freely use and then toss whenever. Additionally, these features are reportedly geared toward Meta's 2026 smart glasses: Aperol and Bellini.</p><p>Meta already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-bans-roll-out-live-ai-and-live-translation-add-new-frames-and-apps">debuted Live AI</a> last month in April. The feature is on its way to its current Ray-Ban smart glasses, bringing a conversational experience. In short, Live AI lets users ask about anything or hold "in-depth conversations with Meta AI without the vocal prompt. The publication's report notes that this feature only lasts for 30 minutes at a time on the current string of glasses.</p><p>As previously stated, Meta will look to extend those capabilities for a few "hours."</p><p>After this reported glimpse of 2026, we should come back to 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">as another report may have revealed</a> Meta's plans for its Hypernova glasses. Hypernova is said to deliver a singular display on the bottom right of its right-side lens. The glasses are reportedly preparing to feature a full set of Android-powered computational hardware and a gesture band.</p><p>The band is said to make it easier to manage what's on your single display.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is currently testing out a new “Discussion” feature for its mobile Search app. Spotted during searches about sports events, this experimental setup pulls in real user takes and drops them straight into your mobile search results.</p><p>SEO consultant Nicholas McDonough shared some screenshots showing what looks like Reddit-style threads coming to Google Search on mobile (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-search-discussions-beta-feature-39393.html" target="_blank">Search Engine Roundtable</a>). The experimental feature would let users post comments, reply to others, and rate posts with simple upvotes and downvotes.</p>

<p>The early version of this feature is being tested in beta on mobile and only kicks in when you search something like “Team vs Team” in the U.S.</p><p>Before users start chiming in, Google Search lays out the usual sports rundown, including live scores and schedules. Then, front and center, you’ll spot the new “Discussions” tab, ready for fans to jump in and share their thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="sports-only-for-now-2">Sports-only (for now)</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this new feature is still limited to sports stuff for now. When you’re checking out a game card, the “Discussions” tab shows up right next to other sections like “Overview,” “Scorecard,” and “Stats.”</p>

<p>The “Discussions” tab is open to anyone with a Google account. You can jump in, share your thoughts on the game, and once you comment, your profile picture shows up. Other users won’t see your full name unless they hit the “More comments” button at the bottom.</p><p>Even though the setup feels a lot like Reddit or your usual comment section, there’s one big catch—no @mention feature.

<hr>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has appointed former broadcast journalist Evan Solomon as the new federal Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Minister. This makes him Canada's first federal AI minister (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thecanadianpressnews.ca/national/cp-newsalert-former-broadcaster-evan-solomon-named-ai-minister/article_3db96b2e-9f96-5872-8930-c85e7eeb27e2.html">as reported by the Canadian Press</a>).</p><p>By creating this new division in his cabinet, he will solely be responsible for overseeing the steadfast growth in the sector and its integration into the country's economy.</p><p>Since 2022, the Canadian government has been talking about AI and even introduced bills, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/innovation-better-canada/en/artificial-intelligence-and-data-act-aida-companion-document">Artificial Intelligence and Data Act </a>(AIDA), which was the most comprehensive bill that detailed a national AI framework, but none of these bills have gone to become laws yet.</p>
<p>As of now, Solomon's specific mandates have not been made public. However, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/former-broadcaster-evan-solomon-faces-big-challenge-as-first-ai-minister">National Post</a>, Solomon's responsibilities would likely focus on three main items: "re-igniting Canada’s technology sector, updating its framework policies to deal with a wide range of digital issues, including finding the balance between economic growth and security and privacy concerns, and improving the federal government’s efforts to make better use of digital technology."</p><p>The appointment of a dedicated Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation could be a step in the right direction. To note, the Ministry of Innovation has been part of the country for many years; however, it now has an AI sub-section.</p><p>It is also important to note that Prime Minister Carney's ties to the U.K. and the E.U., and the E.U.'s approach to tech regulation with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a>, might influence Canada's AI legislative direction.</p><p>Canada might take a page from the EU's notebook for some of its principles with tech innovation and addressing the risks beforehand.</p><p>It is also important that earlier this year, President Trump <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fedtechmagazine.com/article/2025/03/ai-czar-david-sacks-means-for-federal-it-modernization-perfcon">appointed</a> venture capitalist David Sacks the first-ever artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar.  While other countries like France and the UAE also have ministers tending to AI within broader portfolios.</p>

<p>Audio might progress further than users may expect, as Nothing reveals its latest partnership.</p><p>Today (May 13), Nothing announced a partnership with the renowned British audio pioneer, KEF, in a press release. The purpose of these two companies coming together is to forward an innovative and "refined" audio experience for Nothing's consumers. According to Nothing, KEF's experience in high-fidelity audio should usher in an "expansion into new audio categories" for the company.</p><p>The company states it's looking ahead to bringing "acoustic precision" alongside its recognizable design elements to consumers. Nothing's head of smart products marketing, Andrew Freshwater, says, "By combining KEF’s decades of expertise with our design-led approach to technology, we’re laying the groundwork for a new standard in everyday listening."</p><p>The post teases that there are already a few of these acoustically precise products in development between the two companies. Nothing adds that it is seeking a long-term partnership with KEF to continue opening "new pathways" into expertly crafted audio products for its consumers.</p>

<p>Freshwater adds, "Our products launching later this year mark the beginning of an exciting new chapter of our collaboration and the future of Nothing Audio." In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.kef.com/blogs/news/nothing-kef-audio-partnership">separate post</a>, KEF stated that more information regarding these products will be available "in the coming months."</p><p>There's one thing to note about KEF: the company is known for creating a wide variety of audio products like earbuds/headphones, but also wireless speakers, subwoofers, and more. If Nothing is pursuing new audio categories, perhaps these are some of the products we could expect with its label alongside KEF.</p><p>Nothing has been in the earbud game for a while now, even its sub-brand, CMF, has gotten <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-convinced-nothings-cmf-buds-pro-2-are-the-only-budget-earbuds-worth-buying">into budget alternatives</a>. The company's flagship line stepped into open earbuds with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Nothing Ear Open</a> last year. Despite these being open-ear earbuds (these don't sit in your ear canal), Nothing still achieved some rocking bass when listening to music. Moreover, the Ear Open was quite comfortable in our review of the product.</p><p>The next few months should be interesting, as we await more from Nothing and KEF.</p>

<ul><li>Google has been spotted changing its "G" logo for its mobile app, making it a little more colorful and vibrant.</li><li>The change, spotted on Apple's App Store, brings a gradient that seamlessly blends Google's multi-colors with one another.</li><li>The change has yet to appear on the Play Store; however, it has reportedly been spotted in the Google app's beta.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>You might not have noticed, but Google's starting to give its classic "G" logo a bit of a colorful refresh.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/12/google-icon-update/">9to5Google</a>, the standard multi-colored "G" logo, present on the main Google app on mobile, looks slightly different, per an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942">App Store</a> update. The "G" is still present — even in the same "font," you could say — however, the key difference is its color style. Google has moved away from its clear, distinct sections for red, yellow, green, and blue.</p><p>Instead, Apple's App Store shows these colors blending in a more gradient style.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that the colors briefly take on a different tone before turning into Google's next signature hue. For example, as the red blends into yellow, it's briefly orange, which is what you'd get if you were still taking art class. Yellow and green create a lime-ish green, while green and blue almost make a turquoise color.</p><p>This change appeared on the App Store for iOS devices early this week, but Android <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en_US">has yet to receive it</a>. The Play Store is still displaying the (now) old logo. The publication notes that the logo gradient rolled out to the Google app in beta. It's not yet clear when Android users will see it more widely.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:609px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.17%;"><img id="YvMX9XnqFyMXqYtDZsK2i8" name="google-app-logo-gradient-change-app-store" alt="Google's logo sees a slight change on Apple's App Store, moving more into a gradient design for its four colors, as red slowly turns into yellow, before green, and blue." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YvMX9XnqFyMXqYtDZsK2i8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="609" height="269" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple App Store)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 9to5 post also notes that this is the first time (in 10 years) Google has done anything to its "G" logo since changing it into what we've come to know. The publication reminds us of the old lowercase "g" against a blue background before the company's app redesign to uppercase in September 2015.</p><p>There's also the old Gmail logo, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-redesigning-iconic-gmail-logo">underwent a font redesign</a> in 2020. The app moved away from the red "M" against an envelope to an "M" that stands on its own with Google's multi-colored design. That change also took a little while before it was everywhere, so Google's behavior in the present day isn't too strange.</p><p>A few months earlier in 2020, Google Photos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-overhauls-photos-new-logo-map-view-and-cleaner-design">picked up a logo redesign</a> that made its pinwheel logo a little less sharp. Previously, the multi-colored pinwheel felt more geometrical, offering straighter edges and sharper points. However, in the summer of 2020, Google opted to soften those edges, as it took on a more "modern" appeal.</p><p>Interestingly, this change comes at a time when Google's Android Show is discussing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">everything new and exciting</a> coming to the OS. Among the updates was talk of Material 3 Expressive, Android's new major design overhaul. There's a chance Google could look to bring this gradient look to more apps, as 9to5 notes, but only time will tell.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amid the flurry of Google's Android updates today (May 13), Samsung enters the fray with a major announcement for its watches and buds.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/google-gemini-coming-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-buds-smarter-wearables/">Newsroom post</a>, Samsung announced that its Galaxy Watches and Galaxy Buds will soon benefit from complete Google Gemini integration. Not only will Gemini further "extend AI functionalities" across its accessories, but each device will pick up a little uniqueness. Samsung states its Galaxy Watch integration gains "hands-free assistance using natural voice commands."</p><p>Galaxy Watch owners will be able to utilize Gemini for reminders, summaries, and notification reading. For reminders, users can tell Gemini to "remember" what locker they're using or an important task they need to complete. Additionally, you can even tell Gemini to "summarize my last email," which will prompt the AI to give you an "overview" of its contents.</p><p>Samsung states Gemini's intelligence will work across your apps to avoid hiccups and streamline the process.</p><p>When it comes to the company's Galaxy Buds, the post highlights the Galaxy Buds 3 series, as Samsung says Gemini works well with their voice and pinch controls.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Galaxy Buds 3 series</a> features a radical new design with a long stem that features its own touch controls. Samsung says users will soon be able to activate Gemini via their buds and "smoothly interact with your smartphone." Users can quickly leverage Gemini's help for weather forecasts without needing to reach for their phones.</p><p>These updates are set to hit Galaxy Watches and Galaxy Buds "in the coming months." More information about it is likely to surface closer to Samsung's planned release date.</p><p>Samsung's partnership with Google and its AI Gemini continues, especially following the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">the Galaxy S25 series</a>. A more recent update hit S25 users, which brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-update-brings-gemini-live-capabilities-to-samsung-galaxy-s25-users">Gemini Live capabilities to the trio</a>. The update debuted Gemini Live's visual conversational abilities to S25 users for real-time help over an abundance of topics. Gemini Live can be activated by pressing and holding the S25's side button, enabling it to see what you see for assistance.</p><p>Outside of that, Samsung's announcement is well-timed as Google is busy with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/the-android-show-i-o-special-live-blog-everything-coming-to-android-16">Android Show flurry of updates</a>.

<hr>
<p>If your phone or favorite app suddenly looks a little more stylish, colorful, and friendlier, it’s probably thanks to Google’s new design update it's calling Material 3 Expressive.</p><p>At the upcoming I/O developer conference, Google is set to officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-i-o-2025-prepares-sessions-list-android-xr-ai">show off the next big chapter in Android’s design story</a>, which got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-leaked-its-own-design-process-for-material-3-expressive">leaked earlier this month</a>. It's not just giving it a fresh coat of paint — the company is switching things up in a big way.</p><p>In a fresh blog post, Google explains that M3 Expressive is all about design that feels good, makes sense, and helps you do what you came to do. It leans on five key ingredients, such as color, shape, size, motion, and containment to subtly steer your attention to the stuff that actually matters on your screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.39%;"><img id="V3E9GbdviQmW7rZDfqW84X" name="Material-3-Expressive-design-language" alt="key elements of Google's new design language called Material 3 Expressive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V3E9GbdviQmW7rZDfqW84X.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2096" height="1182" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="design-with-feels-2">Design with feels</h2>
<p>The new design direction aims to build interfaces that actually connect with users on a deeper, more emotional level. Big shifts like this don’t just change how Android looks, but also change how app developers build and shape their apps too.</p><p>Google is hyping M3 Expressive as its most heavily tested design system ever, and it has the numbers to back it up. After 46 rounds of design tweaks and feedback from over 18,000 people, the company has landed on a style that leans hard on color, shape, size, and motion to make everything feel smoother and easier to use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:624px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uttUtXu4vhSCZUAkBXXDug" name="Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uttUtXu4vhSCZUAkBXXDug.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="624" height="351" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tech giant conducted its research to look into what grabbed people’s attention in a design, how different visual styles made them feel, and how quickly they could figure out what an interface was supposed to do.</p>
<h2 id="speed-demon-mode-2">Speed demon mode</h2>
<p>Google also went into the specifics with its testing, like figuring out which progress bar made wait times feel shorter, or how big a button should be to hit it easily without covering up the rest of the screen. It even dug into how different loading animations mess with our sense of time while waiting.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company claims that Material 3 Expressive helps users spot key interface elements up to four times faster than the old Material 3 design. Additionally, it levels the playing field across age groups, with users over 45 finding interface elements just as quickly as younger folks, as per Google.</p>
