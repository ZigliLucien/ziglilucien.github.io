It sports a fairly lightweight design that's easy to wear, a wide range of fitness features like Training Effect, Garmin Coach, and Recovery Time displays, and all-systems GNSS for optimal tracking accuracy.</p><p>While you can go even cheaper with the Forerunner 55, the 165 comes with a better heart rate sensor, HRV data, blood oxygen data, and the aforementioned GNSS system. It also comes with a cool toggleable display that can switch back and forth from AMOLED and MIP modes.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0CT3SGHXL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="aAeAbTE78C6rGwUtc58g6Z" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-black" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aAeAbTE78C6rGwUtc58g6Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1599" height="1599" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Garmin Forerunner 165:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0CT3SGHXL" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$249.99</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The affordable Garmin Forerunner 165 is currently $50 off as the holidays approach, marking a 20% discount and bringing the price down to just $200. While it isn't the cheapest of Garmin's lineup, it's probably about as cheap as we'd recommend going for anyone who wants a robust portfolio of running, cycling, and other workout programs.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0CT3SGHXL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin smartwatch</a> for under $200 that has a wide range of running and exercise programs, sensors, and additional capabilities; you like being able to switch between the dim MIP display and a bright, hyper-functional AMOLED-style display; you want something with a sporty design that isn't too bulky.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're already a serious athlete who is entrenched in more premium fitness watches, and you'd rather not go with the best affordable Garmin watch; you'd consider upgrading to many of Garmin's more expensive options for advanced feature sets; you need a watch with more than 4GB of music storage.</p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 fits well into the company's lineup as an affordable, entry-level point into the smartwatch world. It features the hyper-accurate GNSS tracking, several programs for running, cycling, and more, and a long battery life that's suitable for longer-term outdoor adventures. Even with the low price tag, it still offers about 19 hours of battery with GPS tracking on, or 11 days in smartwatch mode. Our tests revealed the GNSS systems to be as accurate as they claimed, and we love the daily suggested workouts, race-adaptive training, and Garmin Coach features.</p><p>As for sensors, the Forerunner 165 includes an accelerometer, an altimeter, the Elevate v4 HRM heart rate system, Sp02, and a Pulse Ox sensor. Additionally, it sports a compass and an ambient light, as well as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and 4GB of onboard music storage.</p><p>To be sure, the 165 is a big step up for Garmin from past iterations, especially because of its accuracy in both GPS tracking and health monitoring systems, and $50 off doesn't hurt either.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Pixel 10 series was a clear indication of how hard Google has worked on its AI.</p><p>The phone has incredible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>, allowing for many AI features to run locally on the Pixel. The phone has more AI tools that are beyond photography, like NotebookLM, and this year, Google added Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-continues-pushing-out-google-assistant-in-a-steady-rebrand-effort">as a permanent Google assistant replacement</a> across all of its platforms.</p><p>The phone’s hardware itself wasn’t really that much of an upgrade that many people thought there would be, but that’s not the point. I don’t think that was Google’s point either.</p><p>Google also launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">Magic Cue, which suggests helpful actions by “connecting the dots”</a> across apps like Gmail, Calendar, and Messages.

This, to me, meant that AI isn’t giving the ROI back to Google…yet.</p><p>Because of consistency and hard work, I am convinced that people will eventually start caring more about AI on their phones and what their phones are capable of. Google took 2025 to change the way you think about AI on your phone, and the company is doing a good job of making you care. They’re just... not there yet. And, I think that final push is coming in 2026.</p><p>People are slowly realizing the importance of AI on their phones, but they aren’t fully convinced yet.

The year continued with excellent growth, with a much-needed upgrade following the launch of the Galaxy Z Fold 7.

Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series has changed that, and the new Redmi Note 15 Pro and 15 Pro+ 5G take it further with strong durability and longer-lasting batteries.</p><p>On the outside, the Note 15 Pro models look similar to their predecessors. The phones are still big, flat, and clearly Redmi. What’s new is Xiaomi’s focus on durability. Now, both phones have IP66, IP68, IP69, and IP69K ratings, plus SGS-certified drop resistance and Gorilla Glass Victus 2. This is a big step up from the Redmi Note 14 series, which had good protection but not at this level.</p><p>So what do all those ratings mean for you? These phones can handle high-pressure, high-temperature water jets. You still get Gorilla Glass Victus 2 like on the Redmi Note 14 Pro series, but the Note 15 Pro’s “Titan Structure” means the phones pack "a high-strength motherboard, a reinforced mid-frame with high thermal conductivity, and shock-absorbing enhancements across seven key components for exceptional structural durability."</p><h2 id="silicon-carbon-is-the-new-battery-standard-2">Silicon-carbon is the new battery standard</h2><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a> already had a big battery, but the Note 15 Pro+ goes further with a 6,500mAh silicon-carbon battery in a slim body. The standard Note 15 Pro offers even more, with a 6,580mAh battery.</p><p>This is a big jump from the 5,110mAh battery in earlier models. The Pro+ supports 100W HyperCharge, and Xiaomi claims the battery will stay usable for six years, but actual results may vary depending on how you use it.</p><p>The processing power has also improved. The Note 14 Pro+ used the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, but the Note 15 Pro+ now uses the Snapdragon 7s Gen 4.</p><p>For the standard Pro model, Redmi replaced the Note 14’s Dimensity 7300-Ultra with the newer Dimensity 7400-Ultra. To prevent overheating during gaming, the Pro+ uses a new Xiaomi IceLoop system with a stainless steel loop pump.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.15%;"><img id="XWVMdCNsHqxPvnu8HFYRAk" name="Redmi-Note-15-Pro-series-1" alt="Silver and brown rear panels of the Redmi Note 15 Pro and Pro Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XWVMdCNsHqxPvnu8HFYRAk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3016" height="2538" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="offline-calling-is-a-standout-feature-2">Offline calling is a standout feature</h2><p>There is also a new feature not found on the Note 14 or most other phones in this price range: Xiaomi Offline Communication.</p><p>Both Note 15 models have a special chip that lets you make voice calls over long distances without network coverage. If you hike, camp, or worry about losing signal in emergencies, this feature is a strong reason to upgrade. This feature requires a SIM card and a logged-in Xiaomi account to operate.</p><p>The Note 15 Pro+ keeps its quad-curved look, now called a Liquid Display, while the standard Pro has a flat screen that many users prefer. Both screens reach up to 3,200 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>The main camera is still 200MP, but the Note 15 series now includes more advanced AI features like Google Gemini and AI Erase Pro out of the box.</p><p>The Redmi Note 15 Pro will be available in Titanium, Glacier Blue, Mist Purple, and Black at a starting price of €399/£349. The Pro+ will come in Mocha Brown, Glacier Blue, and Black, starting at €499/£429. Preorders for both models will start in January 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Some things I didn’t see coming, like Spotify finally offering lossless audio streaming! I’m <em><strong>still</strong></em> shocked that it actually happened. Some things, like Auracast, saw some growth, but widespread adoption still left me a bit underwhelmed, given the technology’s powerful potential.</p><p>So, let’s take a look at what I saw in the consumer audio market in 2025 and grade how well manufacturers met the expectations I had at the end of 2024.</p><h2 id="these-things-were-mostly-misses-in-2025-2">These things were mostly misses in 2025</h2><p>I began my 2024 end-of-year look-ahead with two quality-of-life features that are “must-haves”: offline voice control and live translation. Samsung was at the top of my list for both features in 2024, and sadly, not many others have put earbuds on the market with on-device voice controls.</p><p>To recap, on-device voice controls shouldn’t be confused with connecting to an AI agent like Google Assistant/Gemini, Alexa, or Siri. On-device voice controls let you interact with basic earbud features without using a wake word or an internet connection through your phone. They were a game-changer during my time with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>.</p><p>Yes, there are devices with head gesture controls in the wild, but outside of Apple’s AirPods lineup or Sony’s Linkbuds Fit, they’re a rare find when it comes to earbuds you can fully use with your Android devices.</p><p>All is not lost, though! In December 2025, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/this-is-everything-in-google-translates-three-big-updates-rolling-out-for-android">expanded live translation capabilities</a> to almost any Bluetooth or pair of wired headphones via a beta update to the Translate app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wArqLbyY8wWWZQvq9ECQ2b" name="pixel-buds-pro-2-vs-galaxy-buds-3-pro-hero" alt="An image showing Galaxy Buds3 Pro vs Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wArqLbyY8wWWZQvq9ECQ2b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google Pixel Buds Pro2 and Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have compelling live translate features </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In 2025, Google and Samsung finally baked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-and-gn-showcase-auracasts-potential-for-enhanced-hearing-accessibility">Auracast</a> support into some Galaxy and Pixel phones, giving you the ability to listen in on and stream audio to multiple Bluetooth LE headphones and earbuds that support Auracast. The problem is that the most significant promise of the technology, which is its use in stadiums, museums, and other public spaces, has yet to materialize.</p><p>There are select venues around the world, like the Sydney Opera House in Australia and the Marriott Theater in Chicago, Illinois, that have Auracast installations, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me">allowing hearing-challenged people</a> to get the full bandwidth of <em>musical sound</em> that traditional hearing aids don’t reproduce, but easily finding venues with Auracast support is like playing “Where’s Waldo?”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2989px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Au4bqA9SCDYzByH5PpBxAH" name="EarFun-Clip-open-ear-earbuds-lifestyle-ear-shots-2" alt="EarFun Clip open-ear earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Au4bqA9SCDYzByH5PpBxAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2989" height="1681" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Arguably, 2025 was the year that saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open earbud</a> designs come into their own and multiply like rabbits.

Many of those same companies also put out more traditional open earbuds with transducers that sit over your ears instead of inside your ear canals, and they, too, saw improvements in overall sound quality. I no longer believe that open earbuds are useless when compared to just using traditional earbuds and their transparency modes.</p><h2 id="innovation-in-design-and-health-forward-hardware-2">Innovation in design and health-forward hardware</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TR6hSZhTmQtSCFhDuuAaY" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-7" alt="The Nothing Headphone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TR6hSZhTmQtSCFhDuuAaY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I miss the days when manufacturers took chances with their designs.

Some skeptics warned that AI development would hit a "wall" this year. Others worried that companies like Google and Apple were overpromising, leaving them vulnerable to underdelivering.</p><p>I made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/2025-the-year-ai-finds-purpose-on-phones-smartwatches-tablets">a few predictions</a> at the end of last year, and most of them seem to have panned out. AI has arrived on operating systems in short order, and it's becoming more agentic and actionable. I was wrong about a few things, too — namely, Samsung shocked me by making it clear which Galaxy AI features run on- and off-device, allowing Galaxy users to disable online features with a single toggle.</p><p>Now that 2025 is nearing its conclusion, let's grade how the AI industry as a whole and some of its biggest companies fared.</p><h2 id="reviewing-my-predictions-for-ai-in-2025-2">Reviewing my predictions for AI in 2025</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8" name="google-gemini-lock-screen-widgets-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini lock screen widgets on iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Following the colossal failure of dedicated AI devices like the Humane AI Pin or Rabbit R1, I correctly predicted the industry would pivot and try to put AI directly into our mobile operating systems.</p><p>Google led the charge, adding Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-continues-pushing-out-google-assistant-in-a-steady-rebrand-effort">as a permanent Google Assistant replacement</a> across Android, Wear OS, and more. Microsoft's Copilot is the heart of Windows, and Apple is still trying (but failing) to make Apple Intelligence the architect of iOS and macOS.</p><p>That said,<strong> </strong>it's wild to me that Gemini Live's multimodal video and screen sharing <em>only</em> debuted in 2025, considering how quickly it's become an instrumental Android feature. At this point last year, multimodal Gemini Live video was only a prototype as Project Astra. Not only did Project Astra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-lives-video-streaming-screen-sharing-support-comes-to-pixel-9-series" target="_blank">go public on Pixel devices</a> as expected, but it also came to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users" target="_blank">basically every Android device</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-3" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google checked the multimodal box with Gemini Live, and the combination of audio, visual, and text-based inputs has become a common way to use AI. Agentic control developed a bit slower than I expected, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-gemini-agent-can-orchestrate-complex-tasks-on-your-behalf-in-the-gemini-app">Gemini Agent</a> and the agent-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-antigravitys-rate-limits-are-changing-amid-incredible-demand">Google Antigravity app</a> only materializing of late. OpenAI's AgentKit debuted similarly late in October. Alas, it's clear AI agents are the current goal for the biggest companies.</p><p>I was hopeful that we'd see more AI features built right into the OS, ideally using more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a>. That doesn't seem to have happened. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> still handles some on-device processing for Pixels, and the same is true for Galaxy AI on Samsung phones, but growth is slower than I expected.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QtzggC8Tac4y3VobHhwTYd" name="Remix-Google-Messages" alt="Using the Remix feature in Google Messages on a Samsung phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QtzggC8Tac4y3VobHhwTYd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In late 2024, both the CEOs of Google and OpenAI pushed back on the idea that AI would hit a "wall."

That happened, with these companies trading places on leading AI benchmarks throughout 2025.</p><p>I also expected the lines between on-device and off-device processing would continue to blur. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung proved me wrong</a> by adding a toggle that lets you choose whether to process AI data only on your device.

It hit milestone after milestone this year, growing Gemini's monthly active user count to nearly 350 million as of November.</p><p>The bigger moment for me was when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/hey-siri-wheres-apple-intelligence-gemini-is-now-the-top-free-app-on-ios">Gemini briefly became the number one free app</a> on the <em>iPhone </em>App Store. It's easy for Gemini to succeed on Google platforms where it's placed front and center. But on iOS, where users have to actively seek Gemini instead of convenient options like Apple Intelligence with ChatGPT integration? Gemini's success there is an outstanding sign of what's to come for Google.</p><p>Over 150 million accounts are subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro</a>. It's monetizing the experience with advertising tests in AI Overviews and AI Mode in Google Search, and it's earning revenue from AI dev tools via Google Cloud.</p><p>In terms of features, Google released more than I can recap in this article. Some highlights include Gemini Live's video and screen-sharing support, the Google Antigravity AI-based IDE, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/tech-talk-what-the-heck-is-gemini-nano-banana">Nano Banana</a> image generator. I'll also tip my cap to Google for continuing to make tons of AI features available for free, including on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-for-homes-early-access-program-will-now-let-anyone-in-within-24-hours">discontinued smart home devices</a>.</p><p>Really, it's hard to pick apart Google's AI strategy this year, which is why I'm giving it an A grade. If I had to nitpick, I'd say I'm concerned Google isn't making brand partnerships — like Meta's integration with Garmin or OpenAI's deal with Disney — as these may prove important heading into 2026.</p><h2 id="openai-in-2025-b-2">OpenAI in 2025: B-</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="W2CK2WE8g9kEHTCzyBUj3P" name="chatgpt-kotor-ii-galaxy-z-fold-6" alt="ChatGPT Live Conversation transcript about KOTOR II on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2CK2WE8g9kEHTCzyBUj3P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OpenAI feels like a company retooling and looking toward the future rather than aggressively building AI products <em>right now</em>. The company is making a handful of long-term bets that could make its 2026 look a lot better than the B- grade it's looking today. However, as it stands now, OpenAI's market share is being chipped away at by competitors, and its leading GPT-5.1 and now GPT-5.2 models are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard" target="_blank">struggling in benchmarks</a> and among users.</p><p>While ChatGPT still has a gigantic user base compared to the competition, at nearly 900 million monthly active users, its priorities feel questionable.

For now, there simply aren't enough results to justify giving OpenAI more than a B- grade.</p><h2 id="the-rest-in-2025-c-2">The rest in 2025: C</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6oF22aDs6FXHcMDZjjiZ64" name="DeepSeek" alt="In-hand view of DeepSeek AI Assistant running on Nubia Z70 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6oF22aDs6FXHcMDZjjiZ64.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The grade "C" is supposedly average, and just about every other AI company not named Google or OpenAI was average in 2025.</p><p>The lone exception in my book is Meta, which earns a B grade. It's making the best face-worn multimodal AI technology with Meta smart glasses. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-garmin-integration-on-oakley-meta-vanguard-glasses-heres-good-bad-and-ugly">Garmin integration with Meta AI</a> is genuinely amazing.</p><p>The problem? Meta is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-needs-to-stop-the-ai-slop-before-it-kills-its-best-products">shoving AI everywhere its users don't want it</a>, and turned the Meta smart glasses companion app into an endless scroll feed for AI slop. The move is so bad that I'm tempted to give Meta an F grade for this alone, but I'll be fair and give it a B for how far Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses are ahead of the competition.</p><p>Apple and Samsung were strictly average in 2025, with neither releasing game-changing new features. Apple correctly avoided overpromising this year, which I give it credit for. The flip side is that it didn't release anything of note on the AI front, either. For Samsung, its best AI features can be traced back to Google.</p><p>On the AI model front, there were bright spots from unlikely candidates, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a>. But it faded into obscurity just as quickly as it became popular.</p><h2 id="final-verdict-2">Final verdict</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd" name="google-gemini-claude-chatgpt-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-google-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, ChatGPT on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Claude on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If it came down to a coin toss, I'm inclined to lower AI's overall grade for 2025, regardless of how far the technology has come. That's why I'm only giving AI a B grade for the year, even though over a billion people are using platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot. The reason? We were sold a bill of goods that simply hasn't materialized.</p><p>The year 2025 is now coming to a close, and we haven't seen anything close to artificial general intelligence (AGI). We haven't cured cancer or eliminated poverty. All the while, AI is using more and more finite resources, leading to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-impacts-data-centers-water-data/" target="_blank">water drought concerns</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/dell/dell-commercial-pc-price-hike-ram">global RAM shortages</a>. Layoffs are mounting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-layoffs-hit-again-hundreds-in-android-and-pixel-teams-impacted">by the tens of thousands</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-admits-ai-might-be-moving-too-fast">even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman now says</a> he's "worried about the rate of change that's happening in the world right now."</p><p>So, yes, AI models and interfaces are more powerful than ever in 2025. But let's face it — few are truly excited by AI writing your emails or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-creating-tv-ads-with-ai-watch-the-first-one-for-ai-mode-in-search">generating a bad TV commercial</a>. We were sold a life-changing technology, and three years after ChatGPT debuted, it's clear AI is still far from fitting the bill. With this context, an overall B grade is the absolute highest I can give AI for 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Earlier leaks said the base and Plus models would keep the 10MP 3x telephoto lens from the S25, but this new leak lists a 12MP 3x telephoto camera instead.</p><p>Is it a simple typo, or is Samsung finally upgrading the zoom hardware on its non-Ultra phones? Given that the 10MP sensor has been around for generations, a bump to 12MP would be long overdue.</p><p>The charging speeds on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> have felt stagnant for years. The base S26 is reportedly stuck at 25W, but the Ultra is getting a much-needed boost. The leaked image corroborates rumors of 60W wired charging for the S26 Ultra, jumping up from the 45W cap we’ve seen previously.</p><p>With a 5,000mAh cell and the efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (or Exynos 2600, depending on where you live), Ultra users might finally stop worrying about battery life.</p><p>If this new leak is accurate, the Galaxy S26 Plus could be a surprise hit in 2026, giving users an Ultra-sized experience without the Ultra price. Still, the differences in camera specs and screen size mean we should wait for official details before getting too excited.</p><p>We expect Samsung to clear up the confusion at Unpacked early next year. Until then, keep your chargers handy, though hopefully, you won't need them as often.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And while Samsung has been making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> for over seven years now, the company appears to already be working on a new form factor that would directly compete with the foldable iPhone.</p><p>According to previous reports, Apple is taking a different approach with its foldable iPhone. While most foldable phones today are taller than they are wide, Apple's foldable iPhone is expected to feature a wider design, closer to a passport or book-like form factor. This would reportedly deliver a more tablet-like experience with a 4:3 aspect ratio that is easier to hold and better suited for video and content consumption.</p><p>Now, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20251219000227">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/jukan05/status/2002734601735962945">@jukan05 on X</a>), Samsung has also started working on a Wide Fold with a wider form factor than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to counter Apple's foldable iPhone.</p><p>The report claims Samsung's Wide Fold will feature a 7.6-inch inner OLED display, nearly matching Apple's rumored 7.58-inch inner screen size.</p><h2 id="samsung-may-be-copying-apple-s-foldable-homework-2">Samsung may be copying Apple's foldable homework</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CADi6sXzFaP6wVqNGAvNjb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-screens-open.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 side-by-side with screens open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CADi6sXzFaP6wVqNGAvNjb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The inner foldable display is said to use a 4:3 aspect ratio, but the biggest difference will be the outer screen. It is expected to be a 5.4-inch panel that is wider than it is tall, unlike the tall 6.5-inch outer display on the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/color-me-shocked-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-is-an-absolute-beast-for-gaming">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>This is not something entirely new. In fact, both Oppo with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n2-review">Find N2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everyone-was-wrong-about-the-og-pixel-fold">original Google Pixel Fold</a> used a similar form factor. It is not yet clear why both Apple and Samsung are moving in this direction, but the report suggests it offers a greater sense of stability for users.</p><p>Additionally, the report says Samsung plans to launch the Wide Fold "in the fall." The device will reportedly become another addition to Samsung's Galaxy Z-series lineup. This would mean Samsung could release three foldable phones in 2026, with the Wide Fold joining the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-seems-poised-to-bring-its-exynos-2600-to-the-galaxy-z-flip-8-per-reports">Galaxy Z Flip 8</a> and Galaxy Z Fold 8.</p><p>The report also adds that the Galaxy Z Fold 8 is expected to retain the same screen size and aspect ratio as the Galaxy Fold 7, so no major changes, in terms of design, are expected with that particular model.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Garmin beat Apple, Samsung, and others ... but here we are, two years later. Is Garmin still on top? I decided to run a more thorough test, with more brands and newer models, to find out.</p><p>Companies don't advertise step-count upgrades, but Google tried to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-wear-os-5-1-step-count-algorithm-accuracy-pixel-watch-3">improve its step-count algorithm</a>, then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/second-april-wear-os-5-1-update-resolves-bad-step-algorithm-issues">rolled it back</a> when it inflated step counts. I assume other fitness brands regularly change their step calculations as well; watches that did poorly two years ago might have improved, while the better models might have regressed.</p><p>To see if Garmin is still the step-count king, I charged 10 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a> I own — one each from Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Google, OnePlus, Amazfit, COROS, Polar, Suunto, and Withings — and jammed them onto my skinny runner arms for two 5,000-step walking tests and one 5,000-step jogging test.

I gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> a glowing review and have continued to enjoy using it months later. Both my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-battery-test">battery test</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-fitness-test">fitness test</a> showed significant improvements over the last generation. Wear OS 6 impressed me with its overhauled UI, and the new Fitbit app is promising — though that's more of a 2026 development.</p><p>While the main hardware launch gets an "<strong>A</strong>," I have to knock Google for a few other developments. First, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/googles-first-pixel-watch-gets-its-final-update-ending-official-support">Pixel Watch 1 didn't get Wear OS 6</a>, confirming that Galaxy Watches get at least one extra version update than Google's, if not two. This lessens Pixel Watches' long-term value.</p><p>The messy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-1-seems-to-have-come-with-multiple-bugs">Wear OS 5.1 update in March</a> proved that Google had some QC work to do, though later updates have been pain-free. My bigger complaint is about Google's Wear OS stewardship: Mobvoi fleeing the platform in 2025, after Fossil left in 2024, suggests the "open" platform isn't profitable enough for smaller, non-Android brands anymore.</p><p>We don't have Pixel Watch 4 sales numbers, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2025/sep/global-wearable-band-market-to-grow-9percent-as-smartwatches-and-health-tech-surge">Omdia</a>'s chart shows how Google's wearable profits since 2022 have peaked in every fourth quarter, and we can assume the Watch 4 will hit a new high, given its excellent hardware and positive user reviews thus far.</p><h2 id="samsung-in-2025-b-2">Samsung in 2025: B</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is consistently one of the top smartwatch brands worldwide, but its sales <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-smartwatch-global-drop-q1-2025-shipments">dipped dramatically in Q1 2025</a> and haven't fully recovered. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2025/dec/global-wearable-band-shipments-up-3percent-setting-stage-for-strong-holiday-season">Omnia</a> shows Samsung wearable sales climbed this fall, but Samsung still lost 2% market share, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/reports/smartwatch-shipment-forecast-by-brand-region-2025-november-update" target="_blank">Counterpoint</a> tracked a 5% market drop for Samsung smartwatches in the last quarter.</p><p>You can blame a few factors, like a lackluster Galaxy Watch 7 generation or Huawei stealing Samsung's international market share. It makes sense that Samsung took a big swing with the Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic designs, trying to recapture consumer interest, and reversing its falling trends might be a long-term project.</p><p>My colleague Brady loves how skinny and light his Watch 8 is, and says people shouldn't dismiss the squircle design as ugly until they see it in person. I also like my Classic's rotating bezel and scale border, but I'm more lukewarm on its bulky weight and smaller display. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Ultra (2025)</a> is barely worth mentioning, with the cheaper models stealing the Ultra's look, third button, and brighter display.</p><p>I appreciate Samsung's dogged determination to track as many health metrics as possible.

Things started out strong with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>: Its battery life is unprecedented for a true smartwatch, it fixed several flaws in the last model (such as adding a functional crown), and it has a classy titanium look.</p><p>Yes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-pushes-open-sale-of-watch-3-after-meda-error">"Meda in China" typo</a> delayed its launch into April, but that was a nothingburger. And OnePlus followed up by launching a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-hands-on">Watch 3 43mm</a> in July, and while the signature battery life has shrunk, it still lasts two days, the same as the Pixel Watch 4 45mm.</p><p>The bigger issue concerns the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a>. OnePlus Watches are due to receive two OS updates, but these 2024 models are still stuck on Wear OS 4 — two versions behind the competition — delayed from OnePlus's promised Q3 2025 update window for Wear OS 5. I thought OnePlus would be better than Fossil and Mobvoi at promptly updating its watches, and I'm <em>concerned</em> that history is repeating itself.</p><p>Then we ended the year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-lite-announced-with-oppo-watch-s-design">OnePlus Watch Lite</a>, which I hoped would be a cheap Wear OS watch; instead, it'll use a proprietary OS, similar to the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-watch-review">OnePlus Watch</a>. This doesn't guarantee that OnePlus will abandon Wear OS for good, but it does feel like another warning sign.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It makes models like the $300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS Pace Pro</a> feel like a great value, because you get tools like offline maps and Strava Live Segments that only $600+ Garmin watches have.</p><p>It's no coincidence that COROS is the "fastest-growing watch brand year-over-year on Strava" in the app's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://contentful-assets.strava.com/Strava-Year-In-Sport-Trend-Report-2025-US.pdf">2025 end-of-year report</a>.

The closing date for TikTok's sale is Jan. 22, 2026, and if there are no roadbumps along the way, the popular social media platform could be in new hands in roughly a month's time. If you're a TikTok user in the U.S. wondering what this means for the social app, you're in the right place.</p><p>The deal was announced internally by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a> CEO Shou Chew in a memo obtained by multiple news outlets. The TikTok leader reportedly said there is "more work to be done" ahead of the closing date, although the preliminary deal has been signed. The new joint venture would pass partial ownership of TikTok's U.S. business to Oracle Corporation, Silver Lake, and MGX.</p><p>The new TikTok venture would see Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX hold 15% of the new company, with ByteDance keeping 19.9% ownership. Another 30.1% will reportedly be owned by affiliates of current ByteDance investors. The terms of the deal are said to create a seven-member board of directors for the new TikTok joint venture, with majority-American members.</p><p>Chew explained the terms of the deal in the reported memo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/deal-tiktok-us-investors-means-users/story?id=128551312" target="_blank">ABC News</a>):</p><div><blockquote><p>Pursuant to the Executive Order signed by U.S. President Donald J. Trump on September 25, 2025, the agreements specify that the U.S. joint venture will be majority owned by American investors, governed by a new seven-member majority-American board of directors, and subject to terms that protect Americans' data and U.S. national security.</p><p>TikTok CEO Shou Chew</p></blockquote></div><p>The new deal is the culmination of a lengthy process that included a congressional bill outlining the terms of the required sale of TikTok's U.S. business. If a deal was not reached, the law mandated a nationwide ban. However, the bill also gave U.S. President Donald Trump the power to guide and approve the terms of a sale. TikTok was briefly banned in the U.S., but Trump also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">signed multiple executive orders extending the sale-or-ban deadline</a>.</p><p>Now that a deal has been signed, here's what we know about how it will affect users.</p><h2 id="what-s-changing-for-tiktok-users-2">What's changing for TikTok users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iYp25mxcTDbEQWRud7ondm" name="tiktok-download-no-iphone-tiktok-logo" alt="Demonstrating the many ways to download TikTok on an Android phone while an iPhone sits face down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iYp25mxcTDbEQWRud7ondm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the U.S. government's concerns with TikTok is how the platform's algorithm could be used to influence the public. TikTok is currently owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. As part of the sale, the joint venture will reportedly control the TikTok algorithm, quelling those concerns.</p><p>The new company will retrain "the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation," according to Chew's memo. Additionally, the joint venture will have "ultimate decision-making authority for reviewing and approving all content moderation and related policies within the United States."</p><p>In other words, if you're in the U.S., your TikTok feed may start to look different early next year — if the deal closes as expected.</p><p>The deal also mandates the storing of U.S. user data in a "trusted and secure cloud environment in the United States run by Oracle," according to the memo.</p><h2 id="what-comes-next-for-the-planned-tiktok-sale-2">What comes next for the planned TikTok sale</h2><p>The closing date for TikTok's sale is set to arrive next month, but in order for that to happen, a few questions will need to be answered.</p><p>Most importantly, experts say that China could block the deal from closing. In the past, U.S. President Trump said that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal, but this has not been officially confirmed by the Chinese government. Additionally, it remains to be seen whether the signed deal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-bill-to-ban-tiktok-signed-into-law">meets the conditions of the congressional bill banning TikTok</a>.</p><p>If everything moves forward as expected, TikTok users in the U.S. could start seeing a different algorithm next month.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">launched the Galaxy Z Trifold</a> on December 1, which is said to bring the power of "the most advanced foldable technologies" right into the palm of your hands.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, making the form factor more valid and widely available to the broader smartphone market. When Samsung launches a new device, the entire ecosystem follows, from Google optimizing Android for it to carriers that might be willing to subsidize it for consumers. This also means developers will start creating apps compatible with multi-window support on a larger scale. But it doesn't just end there.</p><p>Samsung's aim wasn't about adding another screen, but to experiment with whether a trifold could actually be a usable product. While it may not replace traditional slab phones anytime soon, it could double as a tablet and a productivity tool. This kind of shift in thought from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/poll-would-you-buy-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">"Why would you want this?" to "Who is this actually made for?"</a> is a huge deal.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13</a> had a lot going for it, from impressive cameras to a huge battery and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> water and dust resistance. That, alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, showcased OnePlus's commitment to the higher-end segment, which should help increase its Total Addressable Market beyond the $300-$600 segment.</p><p>OnePlus furthered this with the launch of its second flagship in one year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>, which boasts the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> and offsets the power-hungry chip with a massive 7,300mAh battery.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, for example, is one of the most impressive and well-designed smartwatches I’ve ever seen, and features perhaps the longest battery life of any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>.</p><p>At a time when Google and Samsung seemingly dominate Wear OS, it’s impressive that OnePlus can give its watches a leg up over rivals in ways they haven’t been able to replicate.</p><p>That also goes for its tablets. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad 3</a> swiftly became one of our favorite tablets, thanks to its beautiful display, slim design, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip, which seemingly outperforms <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/i-dont-think-tablets-can-get-any-better-than-the-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra">Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</a>. It’s clear OnePlus was not going to let Samsung rule the Android tablet market unchecked.</p><p>This is all tied together by OnePlus' impressive software, from OxygenOS 15 to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-hands-on">OxygenOS 16</a>, both of which improved performance and introduced a host of AI features that feel well implemented.</p><h2 id="missed-opportunities-2">Missed opportunities</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GTr2YUbdcBZZuZSWjTnB7b" name="oneplus-15-unboxing-01" alt="Unboxing the OnePlus 15 with the included charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GTr2YUbdcBZZuZSWjTnB7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, OnePlus continues to hinder itself in one of its biggest markets.

As it stands, the company's market share is negligible, and I feel like the OnePlus 13 and 15 could have been bigger hits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the lack of a foldable didn't go unnoticed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> was an impressively thin phone that gave us hope for an equally impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-oneplus-open-as-good-as-i-remember">OnePlus Open</a> successor. Unfortunately, OnePlus stayed out of the foldable race altogether.</p><p>On the one hand, it makes sense given OnePlus's lack of carrier presence to help offset the exorbitant foldable prices. However, the OnePlus Open was so well received that it felt odd not to see OnePlus tap its OPPO partnership to bring a new device to the U.S. to give Google and Samsung a proper challenge.</p><p>OnePlus has proven that it has the tools to create an amazing range of devices. I just wish it had showcased that more in 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After several years of only minor camera changes in the Z Fold series, a new rumor suggests the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Galaxy Z Fold 8</a> will get two major sensor upgrades that could help it match Samsung’s top non-foldable phones.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-fold-8/" target="_blank">GalaxyClub</a>, Samsung will keep the 200MP main camera from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. Keeping this sensor shows confidence, but the real news is about the other cameras.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 8 is tipped to get a big upgrade to its ultrawide camera, moving from a 12MP sensor to a 50MP one. This higher resolution should mean clearer wide photos and more options for cropping.</p><p>Samsung is also saidto be upgrading the telephoto camera. The change from a 10MP to a 12MP sensor might seem small, but with the same 3x optical zoom, it should produce sharper zoomed images.</p><h2 id="selfies-stay-the-same-2">Selfies stay the same</h2><p>However, not all cameras could see upgrades. The report says the front-facing cameras will likely stay the same. This isn’t surprising, since Samsung tends to be careful with front camera changes, and it shows the company is focusing on the cameras people use most.</p><p>This shift highlights Samsung’s changing priorities. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable phones</a> are now mainstream and expensive, so buyers expect them to match regular phones in camera quality.</p><p>None of this is official yet, and things could change before launch. Still, if Samsung follows its usual schedule and releases in 2026, the Galaxy Z Fold 8 could be the first Fold that doesn’t make buyers settle for less in photography.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, though, the rivalry between Xreal and Viture has shifted from product features to a legal battle.</p><p>Viture, known for its user-friendly AR glasses, now faces a potential sales freeze in several European markets after a German granted a temporary preliminary injunction based on rival Xreal patents. The Science and Technology Innovation Board Daily <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://api3.cls.cn/c/2234287" target="_blank">reports</a> that "the products involved in the lawsuit have lost their legal sales qualifications in the German market."

This patent, owned by Xreal, covers an augmented reality device and its optical system. It's important to note that this injunction is not a final ruling, nor is it confirmation of a patent breach.</p><p>The injunction states that Eden Future is temporarily barred from offering, marketing, importing, or selling the affected products in Germany. According to the source, the injunction may also affect Viture Pro, Luma, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vitures-new-luma-glasses-are-incredible-and-this-viture-prime-day-sale-is-impossible-to-resist">Luma Pro</a> in nine EU countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, and Belgium.

The patent being cited is newly issued and has not yet passed the opposition period. It is already covered by an earlier patent, and we have formally filed an opposition against it. The opposing party is attempting to exploit a procedural timing gap, and we have also filed an appeal in relation to the preliminary injunction.</em></p><p><em>At present, there is only a temporary preliminary injunction in Germany that relates solely to VITURE Pro. However, VITURE Pro has already sold out in Germany and remains listed in other European countries. The preliminary injunction does not apply to any other European markets. Furthermore, our product does not infringe upon the cited patent in any way.</em></p><p><em>All of our products remain fully available and online across Europe. No listings have been removed. We welcome verification of any listings at any time. VITURE will continue to firmly safeguard our legal rights and will actively challenge any unfair, misleading, or incorrect allegations. In addition, we have initiated legal action in China in response to the dissemination of false rumors. During this period, our products continue to perform strongly and maintain leading positions in multiple European markets.</em></p><p><em>We understand that their market position may be under pressure; however, we strongly oppose this act of unfair competition.

The South Korean publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=202512181512471040105493&lcode=00&page=1&svccode=00">claims</a> that, as of this week, Samsung is actively pursuing a future where its next Flip features its in-house Exynos 2600 chip exclusively. There are supposedly two reasons behind this reported decision, the first being the chip's "substantial" performance.</p><p>The report states that the chip's NPU performance has increased to better compete with competitors, such as Apple. Additionally, its NPU and GPU speeds have been increased to levels over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500</a>.</p><p>The publication, citing its "industry sources," also alleges that the move to feature the Exynos chip in yet another Flip is to help the "earnings recovery" for its LSI division. As always, we're expecting Samsung to drop its next foldables, the Flip 8 and Fold 8, next summer. The post speculates as much, but it adds that Samsung might keep Qualcomm's flagship chip for its book-style Fold 8.</p><h2 id="going-for-the-latest-2">Going for the latest</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Electronics to Integrate 'Exynos' into Galaxy Z Flip 8Samsung Electronics' Mobile eXperience (MX) division is considering equipping the "Galaxy Z Flip 8," its next foldable smartphone scheduled for release next summer, with the "Exynos 2600" application processor (AP).…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2002007960105746726">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The timing of this report arrives as we're going through Samsung's official introduction <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-exynos-2600-official">of the Exynos 2600 SoC</a>. The company revealed the chip in full early this morning (Dec 19), showcasing it as the world's first 2nm process-manufactured SoC.

One of the most glaring concerns with Samsung's chips was the overheating issue. Today, Samsung revealed the chip's new Heat Path Block (HPB) design. According to Samsung, the HPB design is the answer we've been looking for, solving heating issues that have plagued Exynos chips of the past.</p><p>Other specifications include a 39% increase in CPU, better AI capabilities, and double the GPU power of what we've seen before. Other rumors about the Exynos 2600 say that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-may-feature-an-exynos-chip-that-outpaces-apple-and-qualcomm">could place it in its Galaxy S26 series</a>, but not for every model nor every market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The term XR, which stands for eXtended Reality, covers VR, AR, and everything in between, constituting one of the few umbrella terms the industry seems to agree on. Everywhere you looked, the wearable face computer industry grew in 2025, and that all starts with VR.</p><p>Last year was pivotal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-market-2025-expectations-predictions">for big-name VR releases</a>, and while some of that continued into 2025 with titles like Deadpool VR, Alien: Rogue Incursion, Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows, and more, the real winners were the indies. That's because, for whatever reason, Meta Quest gamers seem to mainly gravitate toward smaller titles that get big word of mouth on social media.</p><p>Case in point is Animal Company, which garnered "over 1 billion views organically" on TikTok, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/discover/success-stories/animal-company-wooster-games/">Meta developer profile blog post</a>. That drove it to achieve the 5th-highest first-year revenue for a VR game, boasting over 1 million active monthly users and spawning a ton of clones. UG VR is another success story following the same mold of free-to-play titles with in-app DLC content.</p><p>The shift has made smaller teams happy, but it's also driven several companies out of business. Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-lay-offs-strike-again-impacting-its-reality-labs-division">laid off several employees</a> across its first-party VR development studios, and we also saw studio closures at established houses like Toast Interactive and WIMO Games. The silver lining here is that the Quest once again outsold most major consoles this Black Friday/Cyber Monday, according to publicly available info, a trend that's been a regular holiday tradition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-2-units-sold-spring-2022">for years now</a>.</p><p>All of this came to a head in early December when Meta decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reality-labs-budget-2026-quest-4">slice 30% of Reality Labs' budget</a> starting in January 2026, a move that had been a long time coming as the department's spending had grown out of control over the years, while other Meta departments have taken 10% year-over-year cuts since 2022.</p><p>While that sounds bad initially, it's paving the way for a better, leaner Meta Quest. Two lead product and UI designers from Apple joined Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-just-stole-two-of-apples-biggest-lead-designers-and-the-implications-for-vr-smart-glasses-and-ai-are-absolutely-enormous">in early December</a>, and word on the street is that they'll have a hand in redesigning the Quest UI and in making the Quest 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025" target="_blank">an ultra-light, sleek,</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025"> gaming-first headset</a>.</p><p>We're also seeing this shift because Meta <em>finally</em> has some real competition in the sector. Apple released a souped-up Vision Pro with a refreshed chipset and a more comfortable headstrap in August. Plus, Samsung finally launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR</a> headset alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SetF4VNw3S9CEAmxYCnS3E" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-meta-quest-3-split" alt="A Samsung Galaxy XR headset and a Meta Quest 3 headset in a split image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SetF4VNw3S9CEAmxYCnS3E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And to make things even better, we got to try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tried-google-samsung-ai-glasses-prototypes-before-android-show-xr-edition-heres-what-i-learned">Android XR running on Xreal's Project Aura</a> smart glasses, which are set to release in 2026. That's a full VR headset operating system on a pair of light and comfortable smart glasses, and it's going to be a massive game-changer next year.</p><p>To top things off, Valve even announced a new VR headset called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/steam-frame-steam-deck-meta-quest-3">Steam Frame</a>. Frame runs a new version of SteamOS that's capable of not only running Windows VR games on a mobile chipset, but also Android games natively, as well. It's expected to make big waves, you guessed it, in early 2026.</p><h2 id="the-year-smart-glasses-won-2">The year smart glasses won</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2701px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GKLCWXPfqN7SkSjAHnMSKf" name="Meta-2025-new-glasses" alt="Three Oakley Meta HSTN, three Oakley Meta Vanguard, and three Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), along with cases, sitting atop a table in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GKLCWXPfqN7SkSjAHnMSKf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2701" height="1519" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The VR industry has never seemed busier, but the smart glasses segment has never seen the success it had until 2025.

Ray-Ban Gen 2, Oakley Meta HSTN, Oakley Meta Vanguard, and Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses all made huge waves and likely even better sales, solidifying Meta as the de facto smart glasses company after years of spending billions on R&D.</p><p>But the real standout was Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses.

Magic Leap smart glasses powered by Android XR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/magic-leap-is-working-with-google-to-make-prototype-android-xr-glasses">were shown off in October</a> and will compete with Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-unveils-the-future-of-xr-new-features-for-galaxy-xr-and-upcoming-smartglasses-teased">Xreal Project Aura</a> is going straight for the throat with a full VR UI in a comfortable pair of smart glasses.</p><p>Speaking of Xreal, the company launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">best smart display glasses</a> we've seen to date all the way back in February, and the competition hasn't been able to keep up since.</p><p>Xreal One smart display glasses look similar to previous Xreal glasses from the outside, but they come packed with the first dedicated chipset for a pair like these, enabling spatial tracking for <em>any</em> device you plug them into. That's a game-changer because it means the virtual display looks and feels like a real display, anchored in physical space, no matter how you move.</p><p>Viture launched the Luma line, culminating in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/viture-luma-ultra-hands-on-and-limited-edition-cyberpunk-smart-glasses" target="_blank">the Luma Ultra</a>, and while they don't offer native spatial tracking like Xreal's glasses, they can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">give your Switch 2 an OLED on the go</a> when paired with a Viture Pro Mobile Dock.

While a significant number of announcements toward the latter half of the year won't materialize until early 2026, none of those products are vaporware, and they represent significant improvements in Meta's competition.</p><p>But it was also the year Meta continued to solidify its dominance across VR and smart glasses. The company has spent more than any other in this category, and it shows. Thankfully, that stranglehold on the market hasn't produced poor products. Rather, Meta's consistency has spurred competition, even in companies like Google, which we were <em>very sure</em> would never launch another pair of smart glasses or VR headsets until Android XR was announced.</p><p>If you're a VR enthusiast, exciting times are ahead as Meta, Valve, Apple, and Google aim to push the boundaries of what we've come to expect from standalone hardware. And anyone looking for a great pair of smart glasses already has several to choose from, with the proper killer pair of AR glasses (Xreal Project Aura) seemingly just around the corner.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">tri-folding Mate XT</a> set things off at the start of the year, and camera-focused devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> showcased just what's possible when Chinese brands dedicate resources in this area.</p><p>It isn't just about cameras either; the latest slate of flagships shows just how powerful these phones have gotten. Battery tech has evolved considerably over the last 12 months as well, with 7,000mAh batteries now considered a mainstay. I got to use all the phones launched by Chinese phone manufacturers this year, and I'm grading the performance of each brand based on the devices it launched over the course of 2025. Let's get started.</p><h2 id="vivo-a-2">Vivo: A+</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZcNB5wv42AnzfeMt58Jhjh" name="Best of 2025" alt="Vivo X300, X300 Pro, and X200 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZcNB5wv42AnzfeMt58Jhjh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no doubt that Vivo is now my favorite Android brand. It has delivered the best cameras over the last two years, and it overhauled its software efforts in 2025, launching OriginOS globally. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro</a> is my go-to recommendation if you want the best cameras available today, and it is a great all-rounder as well. Vivo is doing all the right things in the mid-range with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-v50-proves-that-iterative-updates-can-still-be-fun">V50</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-v60-has-proven-to-be-a-terrific-mid-range-phone">V60</a>, and the foldable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">X Fold 5</a> continues to hold its own against the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><h2 id="oppo-a-2">OPPO: A</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rQGgbSmQaxzyjoJEbUgcjh" name="Best of 2025" alt="Find X9 Pro and Find X9 next to Find X8 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rQGgbSmQaxzyjoJEbUgcjh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OPPO also had a standout year, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> is an outstanding device — it is my daily driver, and I don't see myself switching to another device for another month at least. The brand is once again selling phones in Western markets, and that is a positive move.</p><p>I like what OPPO is doing with foldables as well; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a> launched nearly a year ago, but it continues to be great. The only area where the brand needs to do better is wearables; it makes decent smartwatches, but they're somehow still limited to China — I'd like to see these debut in more markets around the world.</p><h2 id="huawei-a-2">Huawei: A</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="A8UsyLTh3DAFfTYZsyBU2i" name="Best of 2025" alt="Huawei Mate XT next to the Mate X7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A8UsyLTh3DAFfTYZsyBU2i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Huawei just isn't letting the trade ban get in the way of delivering outstanding phones. The Mate XT is the most innovative phone I've used, and the tri-folding device is incredible. The Pura 80 Ultra has one of the best zoom lenses around, and the all-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei/huawei-mate-x7-preview-camera-testing-design-battery">Mate X7</a> takes foldable cameras to new heights. While Huawei's software efforts are still lagging behind industry standards, it's clearly leading in hardware design.</p><p>I also like how Huawei is building a broader ecosystem. The Watch Ultimate 2 is my favorite smartwatch, the 12-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/huawei-12-2-matepad-pro-is-the-tablet-upgrade-you-want">MatePad Pro</a> is the best Android tablet I've ever used, and the brand rolled out several standout earbuds this year. And with recent devices like the Mate X7 offering the ability to install MicroG during initial setup, it's easier than ever to get Google services installed on Huawei's phones.</p><h2 id="poco-b-2">POCO: B</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FRhx3vQWPGT8VGhqMbpKih" name="Best of 2025" alt="POCO F8 Ultra next to F7 Ultra and F7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FRhx3vQWPGT8VGhqMbpKih.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, I can't fault what POCO did this year. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-ultra-review">F7 Ultra</a> showcased the brand's imaging efforts, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review" target="_blank">X7 Pro </a>proved to be a great budget phone, and the F7 held its own against rivals. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f8-ultra-review">F8 Ultra</a>, the brand has a legitimate rival to what Vivo and other brands offer in the $700 segment.</p><p>POCO needs to do better in India, its biggest overseas market. By not bringing the F8 Ultra to India, it is ceding ground to Realme. Outside of that, the software needs an overhaul, but that's more on Xiaomi than POCO.</p><h2 id="realme-b-2">Realme: B</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="o7CVGRknbEKr3Qss4HKath" name="Best of 2025" alt="Realme GT 8 Pro Dream Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o7CVGRknbEKr3Qss4HKath.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I started paying more attention to Realme again in 2025, and I like what the brand is doing. As an F1 enthusiast, it's exciting to see the brand partner with the Aston Martin F1 team, and the GT 7 Pro and GT 8 Pro Dream Edition devices are terrific. I'm excited about the Ricoh collaboration as well; as other Chinese brands have demonstrated over the years, there's plenty of benefit to be gained from partnering with a camera giant, and I'm keen to see where that takes Realme.</p><p>If anything, it looks like Realme is now the brand that gets all the limited edition models within the BBK umbrella. This used to be OnePlus' specialty, but that's no longer the case in 2025, as evidenced by the Realme 15 Pro Game of Thrones edition.</p><h2 id="honor-c-2">Honor: C</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Rv6PNfBcCxx5FcY7LxPFth" name="Best of 2025" alt="Honor Magic V5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rv6PNfBcCxx5FcY7LxPFth.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor continues to make good phones, but its software efforts lag behind its rivals. I'm not talking about update policy — Honor is in line with Samsung and Google when it comes to flagship updates — but the state of the UI itself. While Honor has been saying that its software is made entirely in-house, it still has vestiges of EMUI, and it's just not cohesive.</p><p>While Honor phones have decent cameras, the inconsistencies are becoming evident, and phones like the Magic 8 Pro aren't as good as the Vivo X300 Pro or the Find X9 Pro. Honor itself says it doesn't want to be highlighted to its Chinese brethren, instead inviting comparisons to Google and Samsung. Given Honor's struggles with its cameras and their inability to measure up to OPPO and Vivo, it's no surprise the company is unwilling to pit itself against the best the industry has to offer.</p><h2 id="xiaomi-c-2">Xiaomi: C</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5fw7hUMiKDmFWXiJMWTofh" name="Best of 2025" alt="Xiaomi's best phones of 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fw7hUMiKDmFWXiJMWTofh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi needs a reset — that much is clear from its product positioning and strategy. The Xiaomi 15 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">15 Ultra</a> were strong launches, and I liked using the 15T and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-15t-pro-review">15T Pro</a>. However, the Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus was underwhelming (yet again), Xiaomi isn't doing anything to address long-standing software issues, and it doesn't have a coherent vision around what it wants to do with its ecosystem globally.</p><p>Then there's the delay with the Xiaomi 17. While its immediate rivals debuted their flagships globally — the Vivo X300 Pro and Find X9 Pro are available in India and the U.K. — there's no sign of the Xiaomi 17, Xiaomi 17 Pro, or the Pro Max. Xiaomi isn't bringing these devices outside China, and that lack of consistency is hurting the manufacturer.</p><h2 id="asus-d-2">ASUS: D</h2><p>I want to like ASUS's devices, but the Taiwanese brand just doesn't make it easy. This year's phones have been great (as always), but an obstinate stance on software updates — where its phones will only get two platform updates — basically killed any interest in its phones. Combined with the likes of Redmagic getting its act together and delivering better software, and I just don't see the point of ASUS when its devices just don't provide a good value.</p><h2 id="oneplus-f-2">OnePlus: F</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi" name="Best of 2025" alt="OnePlus phone launches 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Where do I even start with OnePlus? There was a time when the company could do no wrong. In 2025, it felt like it got everything wrong. The OnePlus 15 turned out to be a massive letdown, with the phone being a downgrade from the OnePlus 13, and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">OnePlus 15R</a> is even worse — the phone doesn't even have a telephoto lens, and it costs $699. Even its Nord devices have been mid at best this year.</p><p>The way I see it, OPPO no longer sees value in OnePlus, and it's entirely possible it is just running out the clock on the brand. All the interesting bits to do with OnePlus — the Hasselblad partnership, unique limited edition devices, and fun software — have been integrated into other brands anyway.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Among the new feature additions is Expanded dark mode, which has been introduced as a new accessibility feature.</p><p>Toggling this mode lets you force dark mode in apps that don't natively support it. This is great news for fans of dark mode or for anyone that hates being blinded by light backgrounds when they fire up their apps at night.</p><p>This feature is currently rolling out for all Pixel phones that are compatible with the Android 16 QPR2 update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr2/get">Supported Pixels</a> include the Pixel 6 and later devices. To check if you're on the right build, head to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>About phone</strong>, and scroll to the last entry called <strong>Build number</strong> which should say <strong>BP4A.251205.006</strong>.

In my experience, it seems to work decently well on apps that would otherwise not switch to a dark theme even if the system did. There could be instances though where forcing a dark theme could break the user experience and make navigation of an app worse.</p><p>While this is great as a temporary workaround, app developers should ideally plan on integrating a native dark theme for the best user experience, if they haven't already. Until then, Google has come to the rescue once again with this neat little solution.

We've seen slow improvements as more people have become aware of this problem, but this year was the most successful year yet for genuine progress.</p><p>In August, Google launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting">a new accessibility feature</a> that doubled the display's PWM rate.

While neither of these features solves the problem in its entirety, it marks a milestone for the flicker-sensitive community.</p><p>Most Chinese manufacturers continue to offer the best eye care solutions, but seeing Google and Apple begin work on this important topic is a massive deal.</p><p>People who are flicker-sensitive <em>cannot use</em> phones with flickering displays at all, and in a world where smartphones have become an indispensable tool, it's more important than ever for companies to employ eye-friendly settings.</p><h2 id="foldables-got-exciting-again-2">Foldables got exciting again</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e4sKquUTpzadJe6VbYMFCo" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-4" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold with Z Fold 7, Magic V5, and Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e4sKquUTpzadJe6VbYMFCo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite no follow-up to our favorite foldable of 2023 and 2024 (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>), the foldable market was better than ever, even if international markets still get the best choices. Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> is the foldable we've been wanting the company to make for years, even if it dropped S Pen support to get as thin as it is.</p><p>Then Samsung launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on" target="_blank">the TriFold</a> in select international markets.

Two years ago, if you told me OnePlus would be the company to achieve this distinction, I would have been worried about your sanity.

Pixels have notably eaten into Samsung's market share, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-breakout-hit-for-google-in-us" target="_blank">now accounting for</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-breakout-hit-for-google-in-us"> 7%</a> of phones sold.

We've got wider availability of models from companies, including important new additions to the U.S. market from companies like Nothing and Fairphone, strengthening competition in a year when fears over tariffs thought we'd see the opposite.</p><p>The situation in Canada is much better than in the U.S. overall, though. Canadians can buy all the best Chinese phones, which means they have full access to the <em>very</em> best Android phones. U.S. customers can technically buy them through third-party sellers on sites like eBay, but those phones are often more expensive and come with no warranty, making them a no-sale for most people.</p><p>If I had to grade the U.S. by itself, I'd give it a C- because of the absurdity of our carrier infrastructure and the government's arbitrary restrictions, but Canada's market brings North America's score up by a solid grade point overall.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I would've liked to see a more aggressive design revamp, better cameras, and improved battery and charging technology. Even without those improvements, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> held its own as one of the best phones on the market in 2025.</p><p>I'm expecting big things from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a>, although rumors and leaks suggest it might be a letdown. Samsung is following the launch of the iPhone 17 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10</a>, which included trend-setting upgrades like higher base storage and magnetic charging support. To be competitive, Samsung needs to match these additions and more.</p><p>These are the five upgrades I want to see from Samsung's Galaxy S26.</p><h2 id="an-even-slimmer-and-lighter-design-with-qi2-2">An even slimmer and lighter design with Qi2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7fg4XpamVwGs2Q64g8i9r7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-7" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7fg4XpamVwGs2Q64g8i9r7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I praised the Galaxy S25's design for retaining a thin, light, and compact footprint, noting that it was the "last compact Android flagship," but I didn't know it might be the <em>very last</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">small Android flagship</a>. Samsung is rumored to ship the Galaxy S26 with a slightly larger screen next year.</p><p>One thing I consistently loved about the Galaxy S25 throughout my year of testing was how great it felt in the hand. I eventually switched to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> for its thin feel, but the base Galaxy S25 is actually much more compact. At just 7.2mm thick and weighing only 162 grams with a 6.2-inch screen, the Galaxy S25 is incredibly pocketable and easy to hold.</p><p>For the Galaxy S26, I want to see Samsung prioritize keeping this in-hand feel intact while revamping the design. Following the introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Qi2 on the Google Pixel 10</a>, magnetic charging is officially an essential feature for any Android flagship that wants to be taken seriously. However, Samsung should leverage its R&D might to challenge itself to add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi2</a> (and potentially a larger screen) while minimizing changes to the Galaxy S25's footprint, thickness, and weight.</p><p>Increasing the screen-to-body ratio and shrinking bezels are ways of getting more out of the same chassis. If Samsung can add a long-overdue Qi2 magnetic charging feature while still keeping the Galaxy S26 feeling small, it'll have an edge over Pixels in 2026.</p><h2 id="intuitive-ai-features-2">Intuitive AI features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-3" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's AI suite is underrated, in part because of its strong relationship with Google, which brings Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> to Samsung handsets, and I need to see more of that in 2026. Circle to Search and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">multimodal Gemini Live</a>, which arrived on Galaxy phones first, are the types of groundbreaking software features I want to debut alongside the Galaxy S26.</p><p>With the Galaxy S25, the company's AI upgrades were a bit underwhelming.

Samsung should go back to the drawing board and perhaps call up Google to think big for the Galaxy S26's software upgrades.</p><h2 id="a-completely-revamped-camera-system-2">A completely revamped camera system</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XrdrGj8MCdv4ASiiGP4GfK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-8" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XrdrGj8MCdv4ASiiGP4GfK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If I had to describe the Galaxy S25's camera system in one word, it's non-competitive. The hardware can be traced back to the Galaxy S22 series, and if Samsung doesn't <em>significantly</em> upgrade the entire system for the Galaxy S26, it might be dead on arrival. At a time when Google, Apple, and OnePlus are making camera hardware tweaks on a yearly basis, Samsung risks falling even further behind if it doesn't make aggressive changes.</p><p>A camera system riding on a 50MP primary sensor, a 12MP ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view, and a 12MP 3x telephoto lens feels substandard heading into 2026. The primary camera sensor is fine, but for a flagship, two middling secondary cameras aren't good enough. In particular, the 3x optical zoom capability sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-camera-review">Pixel 10's 5x telephoto lens</a>.</p><p>I'd also like to see Samsung pay more attention to its computational photography and color science — perhaps even more so than the hardware. Samsung phones tend to produce photos that can look dull compared to those from a Pixel or an iPhone. I don't want Galaxy cameras to go too far and oversaturate, but finding a better middle ground would help the Galaxy S26 shoot better photos without any hardware changes.</p><h2 id="more-base-storage-with-no-price-hike-2">More base storage (with no price hike)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-12" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Too often, Samsung is reactionary. We all know it's capable of making great phones — just look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> — but its best work usually comes after it's challenged. One way Samsung can make its mark <em>proactively</em> on the Galaxy S26 is by shipping it with 256GB of base storage.</p><p>Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">made waves with the iPhone 17</a> by making 256GB standard without hiking the price. Samsung should do the exact same thing, giving it an edge over the Pixel 10. Not only does the Pixel 10 start with 128GB of storage, but it uses UFS 3.1 flash, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS 4.0</a> you get with the higher-priced 256GB variant. Give us 256GB UFS 4.0 storage without raising the Galaxy S26's price, and Samsung will immediately gain some goodwill with tech enthusiasts.</p><h2 id="better-efficiency-battery-life-2">Better efficiency + battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="562KYDM4rWPqGktqWiNnUF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-17" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/562KYDM4rWPqGktqWiNnUF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Really, the one thing Samsung doesn't have to touch on the Galaxy S25 is the phone's processor. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> is good enough, and although we're expecting an upgrade to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, the Galaxy S26 will be fast either way. Rather than higher benchmark scores or faster gaming performance, I'd rather see Samsung focus on keeping temperatures down and improving the Galaxy S26's efficiency.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 only has a 4,000 mAh battery. With a power-hungry processor and display, the Galaxy S26 needs to find a way to bump battery life one way or another. It could do this by increasing capacity, improving efficiency, or delivering faster charging speeds to make midday power-ups easier.</p><p>But while these are my biggests asks, let us know in the comments what you hope to see in the Galaxy S26, which is expected to launch in just a couple of months!</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's also a battery life powerhouse, and it's made from 75% recycled plastics and 90% recycled magnesium.</p><p>This particular deal is available for both the Black and Matcha colors that the device comes in. It's worth noting that this price is also for a lockscreen ad-supported version of the e-reader, though you can pay a little more to have those removed. Buyers also have the option to bundle the device with 3 months of Kindle Unlimited, which offers access to over 4 million titles.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$109.99" data-dimension48="$109.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNVCQZG1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LDV4MKcPgjVWQg8W2c9wie" name="Kindle-2024" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LDV4MKcPgjVWQg8W2c9wie.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Kindle (16GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNVCQZG1" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$109.99" data-dimension48="$109.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$109.99</del> <strong>$89.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Just in time for the winter holidays, Amazon has chopped $20 off the price of its base Kindle model, which offers up to six weeks of battery life, 16GB of storage, and a beautiful 6-inch display with a built-in light.

It also offers improved performance for a smoother, quicker page turn, and other enhanced display features such as the adjustable front warm light. The 6-inch display features a 300ppi resolution, and 16-level gray scale for an easy-to-read, high contrast interface.</p><p>It also includes a USB-C port for charging, Bluetooth compatibility, integration with reading apps like Audible, and an overall great design that's not bad to hold, even during long reading periods.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant downside to the base-level Kindle is its lack of a water resistance rating, though it's still a good pick at this price if that isn't a dealbreaker for you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you want to find out whether a video is real or generated with AI, it can be tricky to do so. There are varying online tools that can try to spot AI-generated content, but Google is building an "imperceptible" watermarking technology called SynthID to help users tell if something is real or fake.</p><p>Starting now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> can verify the authenticity of videos using SynthID in the Gemini app. This video checker can reveal if uploaded content was created or edited with Google AI in any way. Google says over 20 billion pieces of AI-generated content have been watermarked using SynthID, which digitally watermarks Google AI creations from Veo generations to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-will-soon-watermark-magic-editor-creations-with-synthid">AI edits in Google Photos</a>.</p><p>To use the feature, upload a video to the Gemini app and ask a question like "was this generated using Google AI?" Then, Gemini will scan the video and respond with its findings, which include specifics as to what parts of the content (if any) were created or modified with AI.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hzkG07u8ITU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Gemini might respond with something like "SynthID detected within the audio between 10-20 secs. No SynthID detected in the visuals," according to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/verify-google-ai-videos-gemini-app/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>The video verification feature does arrive with a few limitations. To upload a video for identification in the Gemini app, it must be 100MB or smaller and 90 seconds long or shorter. Additionally, this feature can only spot videos created with Google AI tools using the SynthID watermark — it won't uncover details about content generated with third-party software.</p><p>The new addition to the Gemini app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/your-android-phone-is-getting-a-new-ai-detector-for-photos">follows SynthID photo verification</a>, which debuted in November.</p><p>"SynthID adds an invisible digital watermark to an AI-generated image (or video segment)," Google explains on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/models/synthid/" target="_blank">DeepMind website</a>. "The watermark doesn’t change the image or video quality. It’s added the moment content is created, and designed to stand up to modifications like cropping, adding filters, changing frame rates, or lossy compression."</p><p>Now, Gemini users can quickly and easily check the authenticity of photos and videos in the Gemini app everywhere it's available.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is probably the last quarterly platform update before Android 17, and while it doesn’t bring big changes, it’s designed to make daily use easier for Pixel users.</p><p>Quarterly Platform Releases, or QPRs, help Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/decembers-google-update-boosts-pixel-security-and-fixes-33-bugs">improve Android between major updates</a>. Rather than waiting for a yearly upgrade, these updates add small improvements, new features, and background fixes.</p><p>Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1ppctyi/android_16_qpr3_beta_1_now_available/" target="_blank">now available</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a> from the Pixel 6 up to the newest models through the Android Beta Program. The stable version is expected to arrive around March 2026.</p><p>On the surface, this beta focuses on usability tweaks that Pixel owners have been asking for. One of the most noticeable changes is flashlight control. Instead of a simple on-or-off toggle, you now get adjustable brightness, letting you dial the intensity up or down depending on the situation (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr3-beta-1-features-3625332/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="JvHZSo8pjw9StxB5jkVXmn" name="Google-Pixel-10-At-a-Glance" alt="The At a Glance widget on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvHZSo8pjw9StxB5jkVXmn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3410" height="1917" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main highlight is the ability to remove the At a Glance widget from your home screen. In this beta, you’ll find a new "Show on home screen" option in the widget’s settings. Turn it off, and the widget disappears, giving you more space to organize apps, add widgets, or simply enjoy your wallpaper.</p><p>Navigation is now more flexible, as Google lets users reverse the order of the classic three-button navigation keys. This will feel familiar to anyone who has used Samsung phones.</p><h2 id="see-which-app-is-tracking-you-2">See which app is tracking you</h2><p>Privacy and transparency are improved as well. Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 adds an expandable location indicator in the status bar, so you can easily see which app is using your location. Tapping it gives you more details, instead of just showing a generic icon.</p><p>The update also includes support for over 160 new emoji from Unicode 17.0, helping to modernize the platform in a subtle way.</p><p>Of course, this is still beta software. Bugs, battery quirks, and performance hiccups are part of the deal, and opting in means you’re committing until the stable release lands, unless you’re willing to wipe your device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

By uploading source material or discovering suggested content, users can create notebooks in NotebookLM. From there, that source material can be transformed in a variety of ways, like Audio and Video Overviews or flashcards and quizzes. Starting today, there's a new way to organize data in NotebookLM called Data Tables.</p><p>Data Tables are "clean, structured tables" that organizes data from your sources into simple visuals. These tables can be exported to Google Sheets for further editing and data management. Data Tables are positioned towards students, knowledge workers, scientific researchers, and general consumers.</p><p>Google suggests a few ways to use Data Tables in NotebookLM in the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-data-tables/" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the new feature:</p><ul><li>Turn meeting transcripts into a clean table of action items, categorized by owner and priority. Or build a competitor comparison table analyzing pricing and strategies.</li><li>Synthesize clinical trial outcomes across multiple papers to track study years, sample sizes and statistics.</li><li>Prepare for exams with study tables of historical events, organized by date, key figures, and consequences.</li><li>Plan your dream vacation by comparing destinations, best times to visit and estimated costs.</li></ul><p>NotebookLM source material could include videos, websites, or long PDF files, for example. This could make it difficult to manually pinpoint and extract data for use in tables. With NotebookLM's new feature, AI will do the hard work for you in creating simple and helpful Data Tables.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="APVEkP8t5t3EYaE6W9aK54" name="Notebook-LM-Data-Tables-1" alt="The data tables feature in NotebookLM." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/APVEkP8t5t3EYaE6W9aK54.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google has been steadily adding new features to NotebookLM.

The Exynos 2600 is the world's first smartphone chipset built on a 2nm GAA (Gate-All-Around) process, and Samsung is claiming big gains in performance, efficiency, and thermals thanks to the new manufacturing node.</p><p>For reference, all current flagship chipsets from Qualcomm (including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>), MediaTek, Apple, and even Google are built on a 3nm process, but Samsung appears to have beaten everyone to 2nm. In theory, the smaller the node, the better the overall performance and efficiency should be, although real-world results remain to be seen.</p><p>In terms of specs, the Exynos 2600 features a 10-core CPU built on Arm's latest v9.3 architecture. A notable change this time is that Samsung has entirely dropped low-power CPU cores in favor of a mix of high-performance and higher-clocked mid-tier cores.</p><p>The CPU includes one prime C1-Ultra core clocked at 3.8GHz, three high-performance C1-Pro cores running at 3.25GHz, and three efficiency-focused C1-Pro cores clocked at 2.75GHz. Samsung claims up to a 39% performance boost compared to the Exynos 2500, which powered the Galaxy S25 series in select regions.</p><h2 id="exynos-2600-might-finally-fix-samsung-s-heating-problem-2">Exynos 2600 might finally fix Samsung's heating problem</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jJU7U0ffNOs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Thanks to the upgraded CPU, Samsung says on-device AI performance should see a major improvement. This includes faster object detection in photos, improved image processing in the camera, and better overall video quality.</p><p>On the graphics side, the Exynos 2600 packs the new Xclipse 960 GPU, with Samsung claiming up to twice the performance of the previous generation and up to 50% better ray tracing performance.</p><p>One of the biggest issues with previous Exynos chipsets has been heat management, and Samsung appears to have focused heavily on this with the Exynos 2600. The company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/mobile-processor/exynos-2600/">introduced</a> a new Heat Path Block, or HPB, designed specifically to improve heat dissipation efficiency.</p><p>Samsung says the HPB optimizes the heat transfer path, allowing heat to disperse more efficiently and enabling the chipset to sustain high performance during demanding tasks. By lowering thermal resistance, the new design helps move internal heat outward more quickly, keeping the SoC's temperature more stable.</p><p>The Exynos 2600 is expected to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-exynos-2600-chip-could-be-limited-to-just-one-country">power the Galaxy S26 series in select regions</a>, including Asia and Europe, likely for the base Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S26 Plus. While there were rumors that Samsung might use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 across all regions, the official unveiling of the Exynos 2600 suggests Samsung will once again split chipsets depending on the market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The At a Glance widget, the permanent fixture of date and weather information at the top of your Pixel home screen, is no longer a mandatory part of the experience.</p><p>If you’ve used a Pixel recently, you probably know how annoying it was to try to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-change-your-app-icon-theme-google-pixel">customize your home screen</a>, only to be stuck with the At a Glance widget. It took up space you might have wanted for something else and couldn’t be moved.</p><p>Now, you don’t have to struggle with your phone’s interface anymore. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> QPR3 Beta 1, Google is finally giving users a built-in way to take back control of their home screen (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2025/12/18/pixels-at-a-glance-can-finally-be-turned-off-in-latest-qpr3-beta/" target="_blank">Droid Life</a>).</p><p>The main news is a straightforward new toggle. In this beta, you can long-press the At a Glance widget, go to Settings, and see a new option called "Show on home screen."</p><p>Turning off this option removes the widget right away, freeing up that space for anything you like. Nevertheless, you can keep the feature on, so date and weather still show on your lock screen and Always-on Display.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.02%;"><img id="DK5KXe48xRfih36CuFub8Y" name="Turn-off-Pixel-At-a-Glance-widget" alt="a toggle to disable At a Glance from a Pixel's home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DK5KXe48xRfih36CuFub8Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1306" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Droid Life)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="new-utility-features-2">New utility features</h2><p>Additionally, this update adds more useful features than you might expect for a quarterly release. For example, the flashlight now has a brightness slider, according to a comment on Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1ppctyi/android_16_qpr3_beta_1_now_available/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>. This allows you to dim the light for reading at night or make it brighter when you need more visibility.</p><p>If you’ve avoided switching to a Pixel because you’re used to other phones, this update helps with that too. Now, you can swap the navigation buttons to match the layout on Samsung devices, switching the Back and Recents keys to your liking.</p><p>Before you install this update, remember that it’s still in beta. It’s not ready for your main work phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1ppo3ip/qpr3_microsoft_apps_not_starting_in_work_profile/" target="_blank">Early reports</a> say Microsoft apps keep crashing in Work Profiles, which is a big problem if you use Teams or Outlook for work.</p><p>If you need your phone to work reliably, it’s best to wait for the stable release in March 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The recent beta shows that the company is working to solve a strong grievance users have with the Phone app: it can switch to landscape mode without warning. To solve this, it seems that Google will provide a "Controls" toggle in your phone's settings under "Display."</p><p>From there, the publication noticed that the toggle directly references the Phone app, stating, "Keep portrait mode on calls." The app's early description adds that enabling will "prevent accidental auto-rotation on calls."</p><p>If your phone did happen to rotate during a call, it would split into what nearly resembles a dual-view. The left side would house the other person's name and background (if applied), while the right side kept your call controls. It was a jarring switch that took users by surprise, especially one that Phone Arena cited in its post.</p><p>A user on Reddit asked, "How do I turn this off? Don't think there was ever a landscape mode for Google Phone (or dialer), but now it's doing it for me." They add, "Because when I hold the phone up and talk, it forces itself to landscape mode..." This creates an issue since users might not want to turn off the auto-rotation for their entire device, which is why Google is likely working on this subtle addition to avoid that small (but important) frustration.</p><h2 id="call-em-up-2">Call 'em up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qHshpn5qs4ELLiMrZFzLQG" name="google-phone-app-call-current-screen-hero" alt="Incoming call UI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qHshpn5qs4ELLiMrZFzLQG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nickolas Diaz/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's been working on refining its Phone app this year, after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-apps-simpler-layout-is-now-hitting-more-devices">a beta version from the summer</a> showcased its simpler layout. The layout ditched the old Favorites tab in favor of displaying who you frequently like to contact at the top of "Recents." It's quite a large UI refresh that piles those Favorites into a slim horizontal row right above the recent calls.

Thankfully, the online workout program finally debuted in the country this week, and Apple is once again being strategic around the pricing. Fitness+ costs just ₹149 ($1.65) a month in the country, and a yearly plan is just ₹999 ($11), which is a sheer fraction of what it costs in the U.S. ($79) and U.K. (£79).</p><p>I tried plenty of online workout programs over the last four years: I started out with India's Cult Fit, and while it has a strong content library, it wasn't engaging. I then switched over to Les Mills, and it was much more to my liking, and it had a wide variety of bike-related workouts. I moved to Peloton as I got a new bike, and it was the program I used the most — even though it was the costliest by far.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="D4zRYypPqeEgFhfmuWZCWZ" name="Apple Fitness Plus" alt="Apple Fitness Plus launch in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D4zRYypPqeEgFhfmuWZCWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All this time, I just wanted Fitness+ to be available in India. I wear an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch</a> daily, and I cast workouts to the TV or use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and it's great to be able to use Apple's workout program. Fitness+ has a vast selection of guided programs, including HIIT, cycling, yoga, strength training, and meditation, and it integrates seamlessly with Apple products — obviously.</p><p>The biggest factor with an online training program is the energy of the presenter, and this is one of the reasons why I stuck with Peloton for close to a year. Thankfully, Fitness+ does a great job in this regard, and it has a diverse set of presenters alongside great production quality. There are no live classes, but that isn't a big limitation for me.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZpSdCiXc2xrWW8o64hbiMY" name="Apple Fitness Plus" alt="Apple Fitness Plus launch in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpSdCiXc2xrWW8o64hbiMY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, I'm enjoying just how easy it is to use — it's integrated into the Fitness app, and you can pause workouts with your watch. The affordability is a big selling point, and this is where Apple is doing all the right things; all new users get a free month of Fitness+, giving you the ideal opportunity to try out the program and see if suits your needs.</p><p>If anything, the introduction of Fitness+ in India shows just how far Google still needs to go. While Fitbit Premium has been available in India, it is without a doubt the weakest offering of any online training program, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-update-makes-the-fitbit-app-unusable">Google's constant efforts to hobble it</a> over the last two years have made it a non-starter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NQ8zCx5Jv3jfcY9ELvXrbY" name="Apple Fitness Plus" alt="Apple Fitness Plus launch in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQ8zCx5Jv3jfcY9ELvXrbY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even though Apple took its time to bring Fitness+ to India, the service isn't limited in any way in the country, and you can easily access the entire content library, download workouts, create a custom training plan, and all the features you get in the global version.

While stealth's golden age is squarely in the mid-2000s with releases like Metal Gear Solid 3, several banger Splinter Cell games, and the Thief series (I would even argue Deus Ex fits in there too), a crop of new releases on the Meta Quest platform have given the genre the reinvigoration I've been hoping for.</p><p>Thief VR needs little introduction. It's the first mainline Thief entry in over a decade, and it's created by a pair of veteran VR developers in collaboration with the original developers and voice crew at Eidos Montreal. This time around, you play a new protagonist with the familiar voice of Garrett guiding your way.</p><p>Meanwhile, Espire MR Missions is the mixed reality follow-up to Espire 2, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/2">best Meta Quest games</a>. This Metal Gear Solid-inspired game distills that classic formula to its core and uses the power of mixed reality to transform it into something wholly unique.</p><h2 id="the-return-of-the-thief-2">The return of the Thief</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OnfkhaSyeKU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow is my single-player VR game of the year. I had high hopes for it, given that Maze Theory and Vertigo Games were behind its development — two names you'll be familiar with if you play VR games — and the final product is basically what I'd hoped for.</p><p>Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin's Creed Nexus VR</a>, Thief VR feels like a proper return to the series' roots while still maintaining the fresh feeling that a change of perspective can deliver. It's not trying to add a massive world to immerse players in, change up the gameplay, or turn it into a roguelike or some mixed-reality playground. It's just Thief, in first-person, with a new playable character, and with the immersive nature of physically moving around rather than sitting on a couch. You can even set your mic to "immersive mode," and the guards can hear you talk or make noise!</p><p>You can, of course, play while seated, but it still requires some movement and interactivity not afforded by a controller. Take, for instance, one of the many times I found myself behind a door with guards on the other side. I'd slightly open the door to get a quick peek, then plan my attack by using the door, effectively making it a moving wall.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nCTLMRPosJfjiUM3m8QzYC" name="thief-vr-screenshot-sneaking" alt="A screenshot of Thief VR on Meta Quest 3 showing you sneaking up behind a guard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCTLMRPosJfjiUM3m8QzYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vertigo Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This feeling never got old, and the game doesn't drag on for 60 hours or somesuch nonsense. Most players will finish it in around 8 hours, which, for me, is the perfect game length. I'm 40, have a family and a full-time job, plus plenty of other activities, friend circles, and the like. I don't have time for 900-hour games anymore, and even when I do play them, I often stop between the 20 and 40-hour marks because I get bored.</p><p>Because it's this length, the mechanics never wear out their welcome. Opening a window to crawl through feels brilliant every time. Bopping a guard on the head and dragging his body into the shadows is always harrowing and fun, especially when you play on hard difficulty. It's even fun to use the Mechanical Eye to mark guards or see how the gates are wired up to sabotage them, Deus Ex or Batman Arkham style.</p><p>Shooting one of the half dozen arrow types to knock out a guard, put out a fire, or even grapple to a specific shortcut is generally a lot of fun. I say generally because there's an unnecessary learning curve to the bow's mechanics. It just feels weird to aim, but it's something you adjust to by the end of the third level.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ff349d6e-ac94-46be-b7f5-6aeb02a1d1df" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest" data-dimension48="Meta Quest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:554px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="WkaqdfY59yhRAP4GyLKEsL" name="thief-vr-logo-square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WkaqdfY59yhRAP4GyLKEsL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="554" height="554" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</strong></p><p>Harken back to the days of yore when you played the role of a simple thief who gets roped into doing some good in the world and making a little extra coin along the way.</p><p><strong>Get it at</strong> <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow/6429437293824115/" data-dimension112="ff349d6e-ac94-46be-b7f5-6aeb02a1d1df" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest" data-dimension48="Meta Quest" data-dimension25="">Meta Quest</a> | <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010853/">PlayStation</a> | <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800080/Thief_VR_Legacy_of_Shadow/">Steam</a></p></div><p>I found myself dreaming about Thief's levels more than once. Because of their immersive nature, VR games tend to cause this effect more often than traditional games, and it's always fascinating to experience. The game is even quite nice visually on the Quest 3, and I found that the gamma and environments were nicely tweaked to work best on the Quest 3's LCD, while the SteamVR version was just too dark.</p><p>If you're a fan of classic stealth games, Thief VR may just be the revival you've been looking for. I certainly know it was for me, and I count myself fortunate for having been able to finally experience another proper Thief series game again after such a long, long wait.</p><h2 id="there-s-a-solid-snake-in-my-house-2">There's a Solid Snake in my house</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yn5hsuQeKKA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Once I finished Thief VR, I was craving more stealth. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/laser-dance-meta-quest">Laser Dance</a> certainly fulfilled the Mission Impossible laser-dodging aspect of that, but I was still looking for a game that let me sneak around and take out bad guys, Metal Gear Solid style. That's where Espire MR Missions came in.</p><p>The Espire series is <em>pure</em> Metal Gear Solid through and through. I'd say it fits almost perfectly within Metal Gear Solid 2's mechanics, including multiple playable characters. But the MR missions are a little bit different. It still follows the same stealth concepts, but the difference is that the level is now your home.</p><p>That probably sounds boring to some of you, particularly if you don't have a spacious place. My home is on the small side, but I found Espire MR Mission's mixed-reality gameplay was enough to keep me from feeling confined to my living and dining rooms the entire time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.00%;"><img id="saNVM7Ve4Da3BCnPVNVtCh" name="espire-mr-missions-stealth-gameplay" alt="Stealth gameplay of Espire MR Missions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saNVM7Ve4Da3BCnPVNVtCh.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="200" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Digital Lode)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Espire MR Missions uses the home scan your Meta Quest headset performs before entering mixed reality space.

Walls often become bay doors to the Espire universe, with enemies lurking just outside your walls, ready to burst in if you alert them to your presence.</p><p>Like Laser Dance, you'll dodge plenty of lasers and have to solve several puzzles to complete missions or make progress in one. These all require you to physically move around your room, giving the game a physicality that most simply lack. There's no virtual movement here, and that changes everything.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="866f76a7-4c3d-4742-8ea2-14bb019dae04" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest" data-dimension48="Meta Quest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="j8b4nbcqPvsNHY8M84Uhf" name="espire-mr-missions-logo" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j8b4nbcqPvsNHY8M84Uhf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="1024" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Espire MR Missions</strong></p><p>Step into a mixed reality battleground as your home is transformed into the ultimate stealth mission using the power of mixed reality technology.</p><p><strong>Get it at</strong> <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/espire-mr-missions/23942166455393686/" data-dimension112="866f76a7-4c3d-4742-8ea2-14bb019dae04" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest" data-dimension48="Meta Quest" data-dimension25="">Meta Quest</a></p></div><p>Since the game shifts and morphs to fit your play space, you can take your Meta Quest 3 anywhere you want, and it'll feel like a brand new game every time. That doesn't have to mean a park or someone else's house, either. It can just be moving to a different set of rooms in your house.</p><p>Twenty-one of the game's 29 missions can be played in any size space, while the remaining eight require a specific size to complete. The game is just $8.99 for new players, and Espire 2 owners receive it totally free. Plus, since it's early access, development is still ongoing, which means you'll get more content over the next few months and years. Now that's a real win!</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now you can realize that <em>and </em>see it right on your smartwatch.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/android-bot/">announced this morning</a> that it's bringing its wacky Androidify feature to its Wear OS software. The Androidify app uses Gemini and Imagen to take your selfie and transform it into a green bot. Google states that users can personalize their Android bot on their phone and transfer the final product onto their watch face "in seconds."</p><p>Users can download the recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.developers.androidify">relaunched Androidify app</a> from the Play Store to get started. After snapping a selfie and putting on the final touches, Google encourages users to follow the on-screen steps to transfer that to their watch face.</p><p>This is all a part of the "Watch Face Push," an API that the company detailed for developers in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/12/bringing-androidify-to-wear-os-with.html">a blog post today</a> (Dec 18).  To further facilitate user engagement and customization, Google says developers can get involved with the necessary Watch Face Push resources. For the end-user, what's awaiting you is the "highly-personalized" Android bot in a place that your eyes may frequently venture throughout the day.</p><p>With its upgrades, the post states, "Androidify now has the ability to generate a watch face dynamically within the phone app" before sending it to your watch "in seconds." Users can refer to their watch after sending the new Androidify creation to their watch face and "allow" the app to make changes to apply what they made.</p><h2 id="android-bots-for-all-2">Android bots for all</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="UA8BLtwiurTFLunxEDcCee" name="google-wear-os-androidify-watch-face-update" alt="Users can download the Androidify app on their phone to create a personalized bot using their selfie and transfer that onto their watch for a unique watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UA8BLtwiurTFLunxEDcCee.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Androidify was a part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/androids-september-update-brings-music-sharing-and-personalized-android-bots">a major drop Google announced</a> in September. Personalization is the name of the game, as Androidify can reimagine people as superheroes, snowboarders, or anything else. Uploading an image is just one part. Users are required to enter a prompt to explain to the AI the outcome they would enjoy. In September, Google explained the process, stating that Gemini 2.5 Flash handled the prompt, while Imagen took over for the custom photo.</p><p>Veo 3 is even involved, as users can receive a short animation. This short eight-second animation was something Google ran only on Fridays throughout September.</p><p>The company also pushed its wacky creator <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/my-top-5-google-i-o-demos-from-gemini-robots-to-virtual-dressing-rooms">during its I/O conference</a> during the spring.

The original poster (OP) noticed that a second update hit their Pixel 10 Pro XL this week. The report states that they are on Verizon's cell network. Shortly after posting, the user discovered that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/google-pixel-10-update/">Verizon had updated</a> their Pixel 10 software patch notes with this second update.</p><p>The security patch is roughly 25MB, per user reports on Reddit, fixing a pair of frustrating issues for users who experienced them.</p><p>Verizon states the update brings a fix for a severe battery drain issue plaguing the Pixel 10 series. Devices that were experiencing sharper battery drains than normal should find that rectified in the current patch marked BP4A.251205.006.E1. Another fix is rolling in for "touch unresponsiveness." The changelog adds that this regards "Intermittent touch failures observed specifically on Pixel 10."</p><p>The final fix is for cached content, such as offline media or maps, after upgrading from Android 14 to Android 16. Users on Reddit continue to report that they're seeing this update appear on their Pixel 10 Pro XL, as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.

Shortly after Google rolled out its monthly security patch, users quickly noticed that their displays were flickering when the AOD (always-on display) was enabled. This problem seemingly only affected Pixel 10 devices. Reports explained that the flickering would appear when wirelessly charging.</p><p>Additionally, users also noticed it when the clock refreshed (during AOD) and when unlocking their device. The flicker was quite brutal, as users stated their phone's display would go completely black before returning a second later.</p><p>This second patch doesn't state that Google has solved this issue, so maybe users encountering it still have to shy away from the AOD. That first security update arrived at the top of December, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/decembers-google-update-boosts-pixel-security-and-fixes-33-bugs">bringing 33 bug fixes in its sleigh</a>.

Per the publication, the email features a "unique code" that Premium subscribers can input for a whopping 40% discount on a Pixel 10 series phone. The service highlights that users can "enjoy all the videos and music" they love, which is just a nod to its own online content.</p><p>The code that YouTube Premium is dishing out is to be used on the Google Store when checking out with a Pixel 10 series model in your cart.</p><p>According to 9to5's diligent math, this discount would knock the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/theres-one-key-reason-the-pixel-10-pro-is-my-main-camera-for-work">Pixel 10 Pro XL's</a> price down from $1,199 to ~$770. There are likely taxes involved there for your place of residence, so keep that in mind. That's not all, as YouTube Premium's holiday wishes come with a warning: this deal won't last for long. Subscribers only have until December 31 to take advantage of this 40% discount on Pixel 10 phones.</p><p>That leaves us with a week and six days to get to it. Furthermore, 9to5 reports that not all subscribers are receiving this email yet. It also seems that YouTube is focusing on those who are truly subscribed, potentially leaving out those on a free trial or something similar.</p><h2 id="get-those-premium-perks-2">Get those Premium perks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1013px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.56%;"><img id="5Di5sAmiR49LCZw7QkwAYU" name="youtube-premium-pixel-10-2025-discounts-offered" alt="YouTube Premium is emailing subscribers a unique code for a 40% discount on Pixel 10 models until December 31, 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Di5sAmiR49LCZw7QkwAYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1013" height="502" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the only Pixel 10 series-related discount to float around this December.

The additional discount knocked the device down to $549 on the Google Play Store. This deal, while appealing, was only gifted to "select" Play Points members. Users are able to check their eligibility via the Play Store Perks tab.</p><p>Much like this YouTube Premium discount, users shouldn't wait if they're interested. The Play Store Points deal runs from December 15 to December 27, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. PT.</p><p>In other news, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-offers-free-repairs-for-faulty-pixel-9-pro-models-amid-growing-user-complaints">working on some damage control</a> for consumers with a Pixel 9 Pro. Some consumers encountered faulty displays with the model, so Google is offering free repairs through its extended repair program. This covers devices three years post-purchase date to mitigate the frustrations users have faced.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Not only is this the lowest price these headphones have ever reached, but the price cut also brings them to under $250, a price range where they're super competitive amongst rivaling options.</p><p>To be sure, these are last-generation headphones, but between their price point being substantially lower than the Sony WH-1000XM6 model, and their powerful audio quality, they still hold up quite well. With the WH-1000XM5s, you'll get active noise cancellation, a long battery life, several onboard mics for optimal call quality, and a large set of speaker cups that most buyers love.</p><p>This deal is available in Black, Midnight Blue, or White, while they all include a powerful processing module for adaptive noise cancellation using the microphone suite. They also feature fast charging, touch controls, and easy customization via Sony's mobile app.</p><p>If you don't need the pricey upgrades included on the next-gen WH-1000XM6 headphones, these are a worthy contender for  the discounted price point, with multiple immersive listening modes, wear detection, an included case, and more.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B0BXYCS74H" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="rdySiDNHum7Zj77MVRogz6" name="Sony-WH-1000XM5-render-with-space.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rdySiDNHum7Zj77MVRogz6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B0BXYCS74H" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$399.99</del> <strong>$248.00 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Just ahead of the holidays, Amazon has slashed 38% off the price of our favorite <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a>, the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones.

First and foremost, even their normal price point is a little more doable for most than the newer WH-1000XM6s, while they still offer powerful, adaptive ANC, spatial audio, and easy touch controls that make them a pleasure to use.</p><p>Sony says these will offer up to 30 hours of playback time per charge, while fast charging via the USB-C port can refill up to 3 hours of battery life in just a 3-minute charge. They also include easy customization and EQ settings via the Sony Sound Connect app, as well as 360 Reality Audio, and seamless access to digital voice assistants like Siri and Google Assistant.</p><p>Honestly, it seems pretty hard to go wrong with these, especially at the current price point.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The new software version for Samsung smartphones brings features like a redesigned Quick Settings panel, updates to Quick Share, the ability to see all your files across all your devices, redesigned app icons, and more. And it may be gatekeeping some of it exclusively for its new Galaxy S26 series.</p><p>One of the new Galaxy AI features debuting with One UI 8.5 is the upgraded Photo Assist in the Gallery app, which allows you to apply AI edits to images without saving each iteration. It, however, appears Samsung is hiding even more Galaxy AI features within the build.</p><h2 id="ai-notification-summaries-may-remain-exclusive-to-galaxy-s26-at-first-2">AI notification summaries may remain exclusive to Galaxy S26 at first</h2><p>According to reliable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1999404746608939214">@chunvn8888 on X</a>, "lots" of One UI 8.5 features are not available right now because Samsung is keeping them exclusive to the Galaxy S26 series at launch.</p><p>One of the features the leaker mentions is the AI notification summary feature. This tool is reportedly part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-testing-smarter-notifications-one-ui-8-5-beta">One UI 8.5</a> but currently disabled. It will use Samsung's in-house Gauss model to provide users with a summary of their notifications from the past 24 hours.</p><p>The leaker adds that the feature will support several languages at launch including English, Korean, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Polish, simplified Chinese (中国大陆), Japanese, Hindi, Vietnamese, and Thai.</p><p>The feature will likely remain exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-accidentally-leaks-s26-design-one-ui-8-5">Galaxy S26 series</a> at first, with Samsung eventually rolling it out to other Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S25 series, Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and more later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sTrPFUQTZp4La3Zcff3vnS" name="Google Pixel AI Summaries" alt="Google Pixel AI Summaries" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sTrPFUQTZp4La3Zcff3vnS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this feature sounds familiar, that's because it is.

This year, though, it also offers a look at global health trends.</p><p>The company has released its 2025 Year in Review, and while it still highlights individual wins inside the Oura app, the bigger story comes from combining data from millions of users. Some countries are sleeping better, some are walking more, and some seem more stressed than you might expect.</p><p>If you’ve worn an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a> for at least 60 days this year, your personal Year in Review is ready in the app under the Today tab or in Reports under Yearly.</p><p>That covers your personal stats. The more interesting angle, though, is the anonymized global data pulled from millions of members between mid-November 2024 and mid-November 2025.</p><p>Let’s start with sleep. Oura’s data shows that New Zealand and Australia lead the way. New Zealand members had an average Sleep Score of 80, with Australia close behind at 79.4. Europe also did well, with Austria, Denmark, Sweden, the UK, and Czechia all scoring in the high 70s.</p><h2 id="women-win-most-metrics-but-stress-tells-a-different-story-2">Women win most metrics, but stress tells a different story</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="GVzKg7iM98vDBLsdkxdDg6" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 ceramic collection is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GVzKg7iM98vDBLsdkxdDg6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oura also broke down performance by gender, and the results aren’t subtle. Women averaged 7.24 hours of sleep per night compared to 6.8 hours for men. They also posted higher Sleep Scores (79.2 vs. 76), stronger Activity Scores, and a slightly better Cardiovascular Age (CVA).</p><p>But there is a tradeoff. On average, women recorded about 30 more stressed minutes per day than men. This isn’t just emotional stress. Oura’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Daytime Stress feature</a> tracks physical signs like heart rate changes and temperature shifts, which can rise after exercise, caffeine, or intense work.</p><h2 id="europe-walks-it-out-2">Europe walks it out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3869px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bgTkov3rMyNkYEJqxPoqYh" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-07.jpg" alt="Holding the Oura Ring 4 between two fingers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgTkov3rMyNkYEJqxPoqYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3869" height="2176" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For daily movement, Europe comes out on top. Ireland led with an average of 8,924 steps per day, followed by Spain and Italy. Oura points out that regular walking is one of the best predictors of better sleep, less anxiety, and improved heart health.</p><p>The most surprising data might be stress-related. The United States ranked first, averaging 121.2 stressed minutes per day, but it wasn’t alone. The Netherlands, Norway, Austria, and Canada all landed in the top five.</p><p>That’s striking, especially since many of these countries regularly score high on happiness and quality-of-life indexes.</p><p>If there’s one region that looks untouchable, it’s Scandinavia. Sweden posted the lowest average Cardiovascular Age at -2.8, indicating that members’ hearts appeared nearly three years younger than their actual age. Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Denmark followed closely.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This move comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/some-pixel-phones-are-acting-up-with-a-weird-display-glitch">amid growing user complaints</a> about flickering and vertical lines, highlighting ongoing quality concerns for the tech giant.</p><p>Google has now officially acknowledged that some of these units are faulty, and the company will offer an extended free repair program for them.</p><p>On a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16737524">support page</a>, Google notes that a limited number of Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL units may "experience issues that affect functionality of the device."</p><p>For affected units, the company is launching an extended repair program that covers these devices for three years after the original retail purchase date. If eligible, Google will repair your phone for free.</p><p>To qualify for the program, the device must show a vertical line on the display running from bottom to top. Google adds that the display flicker on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro</a> models also qualifies.</p><p>As with normal warranties, Google states that cracked displays or devices with liquid damage aren't covered under this program. The program began yesterday (Dec. 8), and if you're affected, you can visit a Google walk-in center or an authorized service center.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-also-gets-an-extended-warranty-program-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold also gets an extended warranty program</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-5.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold rear camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, Google has also started an extended repair program for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.

According to the discovery, Google is preparing to introduce better satellite connectivity management for apps and mobile services. Rahman states that Google's code alludes to a "Satellite apps" addition to the overall satellite connectivity settings.</p><p>While the standard (already supported) apps are listed here, Rahman clocked other apps like X (formerly Twitter), Snapchat, AccuWeather, and Google Weather.</p><p>Elsewhere, Rahman noticed that the Android Canary build is preparing a "Satellite" Quick Settings tile. The tile seems to function similarly to your internet or Bluetooth tile; however, Rahman's test displayed "Satellite" as "not available." While that's not entirely strange, considering the method it was discovered, a deeper dive into the early code suggests that this tile is representative of your mobile plan's support.</p><p>Rahman claims that Google will bring similar UI behavior to its satellite apps list, too. For this, the company will heavily consider LTE or NB-based satellite plans. The post states that the latter isn't as adept at supporting the bandwidth for texting and voice. Development is still ongoing, so we might not see this arrive until a future Android drop.</p><h2 id="connected-in-the-dark-2">Connected in the dark</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:262px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:229.01%;"><img id="QcQNN5cASitzV7KcpWMm2J" name="android-satellite-quick-settings-tile-leak" alt="Leaks claim that Google is working on a "Satellite" quick settings menu tile for Android users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QcQNN5cASitzV7KcpWMm2J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="262" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no getting around the fact that cell service providers have been getting in on the satellite game, like T-Mobile when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile/t-mobile-adds-mms-texting-t-satellite-network-test-reported">launched its T-Satellite service</a> this summer.

According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-third-party-headset-cancelled-asus-lenovo/" target="_blank">Road to VR</a>, the company has paused plans to let other manufacturers release headsets using Horizon OS, which puts upcoming devices from partners like ASUS and Lenovo on hold.</p><p>In 2024, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">renamed its software to Horizon OS</a> to show it was no longer just for Quest headsets. The goal was to make Horizon OS a common platform for virtual and mixed reality devices, allowing other companies to create their own hardware and use Meta’s apps, tools, and developer community.</p><p>ASUS was said to be developing a gaming headset focused on performance, while Lenovo was looking into mixed-reality hardware for both work and entertainment. These projects were meant to show that Horizon OS could work on more than just Meta’s own devices.</p><h2 id="asus-and-lenovo-are-left-hanging-2">ASUS and Lenovo are left hanging</h2><p>That plan is now said to be on ice. Meta has confirmed to Road to VR that the third-party Horizon OS program is paused, with no clear timeline for when or if it will resume.</p><p>Meta says it wants to concentrate on delivering “world-class first-party hardware and software" before expanding Horizon OS to outside manufacturers. In November, the company also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-gets-top-level-firepower-to-combat-android-xr">reshuffled its metaverse efforts into two divisions</a>, one focused on Horizon OS and another on the Metaverse Product Group.</p><p>Creating an XR operating system involves more than just adding software to different headsets. Horizon OS is closely connected to Meta’s hardware design, sensor setup, tracking systems, and performance goals.</p><p>Supporting devices from other companies means dealing with many different hardware options, which can make it harder to optimize, support developers, and provide updates over time. By stepping back, Meta is likely trying to avoid the fragmentation issues that have caused problems for other platforms before.</p><p>A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-delays-new-mixed-reality-glasses-code-named-phoenix-2025-12" target="_blank">report</a> suggests Meta’s own next major mixed-reality headset may not arrive until 2027, putting extra pressure on the company to get its software foundation right.</p><h2 id="competitive-pressure-2">Competitive pressure</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-5" alt="Android XR prototype glasses and Pixel smartphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, competition is growing. Apple is promoting its tightly controlled Vision Pro system, while Google is laying the groundwork for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>. In that context, Meta may see more value in refining Horizon OS internally before letting partners ship devices that define the platform’s early reputation.</p><p>For ASUS and Lenovo, the pause means their work is unfinished and their plans are now uncertain. Their Horizon OS headsets are not officially canceled, but they are no longer moving ahead as expected.</p><p>If you were looking forward to seeing non-Meta headsets with Horizon OS soon, that won’t happen. For now, Horizon OS will stay closely linked to Meta’s own Quest devices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-briefly-shows-up-in-us">A9 Plus launched last year</a>, but it still holds up for packing a serious punch despite the low price tag.</p><p>Faster-than-expected performance speeds are backed by the Snapdragon 695 5G processor and 4GB of RAM, while the device also boasts a decent 90Hz, 11-inch LCD display. The A9 Plus also includes Dolby Atmos quad speakers, and a microSD port for up to 1TB of expanded storage, along with 5MP front and 8MP rear cameras. The unit also includes a massive 7,040mAh battery, paired with fast charging that can quickly replenish battery life.</p><p>Users also like the large screen size for its use when multi-tasking, as the Galaxy device will also let users open multiple active windows at once. This combined with the discounted price point makes it a good pick for anyone in need of a cheap tablet option that will still offer plenty of functionality.</p> ]]></dc:content>
