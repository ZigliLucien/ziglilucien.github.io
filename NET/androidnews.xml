                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Messages is taking a page out of iMessage's book, using color to denote RCS and SMS/MMS users.</li><li>Anyone using RCS chats, both on Android and iOS, will have their contact name colored in Material You pastels.</li><li>The Google Messages app will also place a small RCS badge to the right of contact names.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While there are a number of visual cues to designate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS chats</a> from standard SMS/MMS messaging in the Google Messages conversation list, there aren't any before you create a new conversation. That could be changing in a future update, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-rcs-labels-3543811/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> found in an APK teardown of the Google Messages app.</p><p>In the beta version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages app</a>, the site discovered small RCS badges beside the contact names of people who have enabled RCS when creating a new conversation. After tapping the <strong>Start chat</strong> button in Google Messages, the list of suggested contacts shows the RCS badge for RCS users and nothing for SMS/MMS users. The feature works for both RCS users on Android and iOS, which is notable.</p><p>The <strong>New conversation</strong> tab also changes the color of contact names that are using RCS. The color is changed from black to Material You pastels. These light shades are more clearly visible when using light mode compared to dark mode. This tweak bears a strong resemblance to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">how Apple handles messages</a>, using blue to denote iMessage users and green for everyone else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1396px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.64%;"><img id="wqtVrYMrZs4EKuDQzJosKP" name="Google-Messages-RCS-Badges-Android-Authority" alt="The color codes and badges for RCS chats in Google Messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wqtVrYMrZs4EKuDQzJosKP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1396" height="1014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also neat that if a contact has two numbers, you can individually see whether one or both numbers support RCS. The badges and color codes for RCS could be helpful in certain situations when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-rcs-chat-samsung-phones">can only send an RCS chat</a>, like if mobile service is unavailable and you're relying on Wi-Fi.</p><p>Since this feature is working in the Google Messages app beta, it could come to the stable release soon. However, it's unclear when or if this feature will be officially released, as Google hasn't publicly announced it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is discontinuing the Pixel 7a, no longer selling the 2023 model on the Google Store.</li><li>The Google Pixel 8a remains available, but is not seeing official discounts as of publication.</li><li>The cheapest Google Pixel 8a is currently $487 at Amazon, which is hardly a steal compared to the $499 price of the newer Pixel 9a.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> is finally available for purchase, Google is tweaking its lineup of A-series Pixels on the Google Store. For starters, the Pixel 7a is no longer available for purchase in any region, which was expected. The Google Pixel 8a is sticking around on the Google Store, but is still being sold at its full $499 retail price in the U.S. — the same price as the newer Pixel 9a (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/11/pixel-8a-discounted-everywhere-but-us-following-7a-google-store-removal/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Google's Pixel phones usually remain available for purchase for a year after they've been replaced, so the Pixel 8a's availability isn't exactly a surprise. The same was true of the Pixel 7a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-review">Pixel 6a</a> in years prior, but those models received discounts to make their value more competitive. So far, that hasn't been the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> following its replacement for the Pixel 9a.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8a is priced at $499 by Google, and third-party retailers aren't heavily discounting the older model either. Best Buy still lists new Pixel 8a devices at $499, whereas Amazon gives it a very slight discount at $487.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3388px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.42%;"><img id="Fo26idMcXD4hX75uNssTrn" name="Pixel-8a-Google-Store" alt="The Google Pixel 8a listing on the Google Store." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fo26idMcXD4hX75uNssTrn.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3388" height="1776" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The U.S. market appears to be the only region in which the Pixel 8a hasn't been officially discounted by Google. The smartphone now costs £399 (an £100 discount) in the U.K., and €449 in the E.U. (an €100 discount). It's possible the lack of a discount in the U.S. could be used to drive Pixel 9a sales, so that the Pixel 9a isn't competing with a discounted Pixel 8a.</p><p>As for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, its stock will likely dwindle now that it is no longer sold directly from Google. Currently, Best Buy does not appear to have any new Pixel 7a units available for purchase. Amazon is selling new Pixel 7a phones for $329, but it's unclear how long stock will last.</p>

The fact is, the number of fitness smartwatches that <em>don't</em> have a subscription is dwindling, and I'd be shocked if the remaining brands like COROS and Suunto don't decide to follow suit — not to mention Samsung.</p><p>Polar's "Fitness Program" doesn't lock key data behind a paywall like Fitbit Premium or Oura Membership. Even more so than Connect+, I'd call this subscription optional; your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Vantage M3</a> will function the same way they did yesterday.</p><p>Instead, it's a training program linked directly to your Polar Flow data, in case you want a cheaper, native alternative to TrainingPeaks. It builds a months-long workout program tailored to your "fitness level, effort, and recovery," adapting automatically based on your progress and daily energy level.</p><p>I intend to test Polar Fitness for myself, but early signs point to it being very useful to athletes! Still, Polar (like Garmin) has always appealed to athletes who like the idea of a subscription-free watch, and the Fitness Program is pretty similar to the Garmin Coach training program that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners get for free.</p>

That gives it more universal appeal, but it's still fair to point out that some Polar fans will wish this program was free, too — just like Garmin Coach.</p><p>On the other hand, it's for the best that Polar made its subscription so specialized, because that makes it less likely that it'll lump other premium features in with it — while <em>Garmin</em> could easily throw any cool new feature into Connect+.</p><p>That said, if Polar wants more people to subscribe, it could follow Garmin's lead and make the Fitness Program more generalized, adding AI, premium data graphs, and more.</p>

<p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a> have always had subscriptions, but that was the trade-off for buying a cheaper Fitbit or Amazfit; if you had to pay later for Fitbit Premium or Zepp Fitness, at least the upfront cost wasn't bad.</p><p>With brands like Garmin, Polar, Suunto, and COROS, athletes appreciated the subscription-free experience so much that they'd pay more than the market rate for one, knowing it'll last years without any hidden fees.</p><p>Then Garmin broke rank and made its subscription the new normal. I doubt Polar timed its subscription after Garmin's on purpose, but it does feel like every other Garmin-like brand is going to see subscriptions as an exciting new opportunity, no matter how much their users grumble. After all, if <em>everyone</em> is doing a subscription, people can't take their business elsewhere.</p><p>I also think more mainstream smartwatches will follow Garmin's lead. Samsung has been building up its AI insights with Energy Score last year and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-more-excited-about-galaxy-unpacked-samsung-health-features-than-galaxy-s25">Samsung Health Coach and vascular load</a> later in 2025. Everything is free for now, but I fully expect all these insights behind a $10/month paywall by next year.</p>

<p>Sure, you can flip it open like some sort of Star Trek communicator (you can also make Transformer noises when you open and close it), use it in flex mode like a laptop, or just do everything on the small front screen if you like. But that's not why I love them; they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2024-is-the-best-pocketable-phone-and-its-on-sale-right-now">make a big phone small</a> when they're closed and that's freaking great.</p><p>I picked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Moto Razr</a> because it was cheap, but now the Z Flip 6 can be, too. Having more high-end but cheap phones to choose from is always great. <strong>Always</strong>.</p><p>The one thing I don't like about flippers is that when the battery is gone or you bust the screen, you're screwed. You'll never be able to fix it yourself, and getting it done might cost as much as buying a new one. My solution is to not drop it ever and let all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">battery saver smarts</a> in Android do their thing.</p><p>You're likely to have a phone to trade in, and Samsung is willing to give you too much money for it if you buy this one. I know the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Flip 7</a> is coming later in the year, but it's going to cost a lot more.</p><p>If you want to get yourself a really great phone that folds up so it's easy to tote around in your pocket, give this a look!</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung has started a trial run for a familiar feature in its Wallet app for users in the U.S.</p><p>An email for a new "Buy now, Pay later" (BNPL) feature in Samsung Wallet was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-wallet-launches-buy-now-pay-later-trial-in-the-us/">SammyGuru</a>. The company's email highlights the feature's upcoming rollout, thanks to its partnership with Splitit for "Installment Payments." The Early Access Program for BNPL starts on April 28 and runs until June 6 in the U.S. While the feature will leverage your Galaxy device's NFC capabilities, there are extra details Samsung is highlighting.</p><p>First, users must have attached an "eligible card" and live in an "eligible state" to participate in the trial run.</p><p>The publication dove deeper, stating BNPL only accepts Visa and Mastercard payment options. Additionally, users in Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming are eligible to sign up for the test.</p><p>It seems that only users in these states will notice the Early Access sign-up button in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a>. Users interested in participating can join the waitlist in-app, which will keep them in the loop about their potential acceptance when the time comes later in April.</p>

<p>Samsung is playing a bit of catch-up with this early access as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-adds-new-features-to-make-online-shopping-less-of-a-nightmare">Google Pay already rolled out</a> a "Buy now, Pay later." In 2024, the company expanded its range, bringing its services to even more websites. Google Pay lets users select from a few third-party providers like Affirm or Zip to split their payments into a few installments for purchased items.</p><p>However, Google reiterated a warning to its users following the expansion: missing a pre-determined installment will negatively affect your credit score or lead to "collection actions." For Samsung, while its early access didn't highlight anything like this, it stated that users could join its early test with "no required credit check."</p><p>Samsung Wallet updates have been relatively quiet; however, a recent update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-digital-key-volvo-polestar-support-details">expanded its digital key support</a> to Polestar and Volvo. The update arrived with initial support for the Volvo EX90 and the Polestar 3, but Samsung informed users that more vehicles would arrive later on.

<ul><li>Apple Maps is now accessible on Android phones via the beta web client.</li><li>You can install the beta Apple Maps site on your phone as a progressive web app.</li><li>The web client still has major limitations, like a lack of support for Apple ID sign-ins.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Apple is working on a web version of Apple Maps that can rival the likes of Google Maps. The company introduced a beta Apple Maps web client in June 2024, and it now supports mobile web browsers, including those on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. As part of the update, the client has moved from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://beta.maps.apple.com/" target="_blank">beta.maps.apple.com</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://maps.apple.com/" target="_blank">maps.apple.com</a>, perhaps indicating that Apple Maps for web is close to exiting beta.</p><p>The beta Apple Maps web client originally only worked on desktops and tablets, but now supports iPhone and Android web browsers. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/11/apple-maps-web-mobile/" target="_blank">9to5Mac reports</a> that the Apple Maps web client is now out of beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/apple-maps-on-android-browsers/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> still saw beta tags on its devices — and we're seeing the same on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> at Android Central.</p><p>The web version of Apple Maps still has major limitations. Currently, the web client doesn't support signing into your Apple ID. That means if you have saved places or guides on your Apple devices, they won't be accessible on your Android phone or tablet on the web. Additionally, the Apple Maps website lacks support for certain types of directions, like transit directions in some cities.</p>

<p>Although Apple isn't offering Maps as a dedicated Android app on the Google Play Store, that doesn't mean you can't get a similar experience. Apple Maps' web client can be turned into a progressive web app (PWA) on an Android phone thanks to today's updates.</p><p>This will let you "install" the site on your Android home screen for quick access to Apple Maps on the web separate from your default browser. You can do so by navigating to the Apple Maps website, tapping the three-button menu in the toolbar, and selecting <strong>Add to home screen</strong>. From there, tap <strong>Install</strong>, and you'll now see the app on your Android home screen.</p><p>Apple has already brought certain apps to Android, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-apple-tv-app-is-finally-available-on-android-with-apple-tv-plus">Apple TV Plus</a>. Time will tell whether Apple Maps could be next.</p>

<hr>
<p>A surprising leak out of left field suggests Motorola is working on expanding its available wearable lineup.</p><p>The leak was posted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1910312297442038032">X by tipster Evan Blass</a>, who provided a photo of a new pair of earbuds and a smartwatch from Motorola. According to the brief leak, the company is supposedly working on new "Moto Loop Earbuds." Blass didn't go heavy on the details; however, what they provided was a (supposed) look at the gray loop design. These earbuds seem vastly different from what Motorola currently offers in terms of buds.</p><p>The Loop device features two hoops where consumers would typically expect the larger space for drivers and such to be stored. Beneath that looks to be its silicone tips for in-ear listening.</p><p>Additionally, the leak offered an alleged glimpse at the "Moto Watch Fit" design. It seems Motorola is chasing a more square design. The device's render is paired with a woven/fabric green and yellow striped band. It's unclear when we could expect these devices or how far along they are in development. Speculation on the specs may surface at a later time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:218.18%;"><img id="3cJZcbqhQ2kipsYDSEndqb" name="motorola-loop-buds-watch-fit-leak" alt="A tipster posted a leaked screenshot of renderings for a supposed Motorola Loop Earbuds and Watch Fit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3cJZcbqhQ2kipsYDSEndqb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="275" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rumored Moto Watch Fit seems to take the design of the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/p/motoaccessories/wearables/motowatch70smartwatch#:~:text=">Watch 70</a> but with near flat sides and rounded corners that give us Apple Watch vibes. Motorola dropped the Watch 40 in 2024, which was a slimmer, more rectangular fitness tracker to rival Samsung's Galaxy Fit 3. With "Fit" in mind for Motorola's next device, perhaps we're looking at a more health and wellness-focused device.</p><p>Hopefully, this is a sign of what we've been waiting for: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-doesnt-motorola-make-another-wear-os-watch">return of Motorola to Wear OS</a>. While it would be nice to see a watch that leans into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-360-review-0">Moto 360</a> design, the return of a key player in the Wear OS ecosystem would still be appreciated. Other companies like OnePlus and Xiaomi have done the same, so if this Motorola leak is to be believed, hopefully, it doesn't disappoint.</p><p>Meanwhile, what consumers can actively take in is the company's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-launch-details">Moto G Stylus 2025</a>, which is a tough, AI-ready phone with pen improvements. The company also quickly started up its teaser engine to hype consumers up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/official-motorola-razr-2025-teaser-clip">for the Razr 2025</a>, which might feature a third model if its short clip is anything to go by.</p>

<ul><li>Google has laid off hundreds of employees from its Android and Pixel teams on Thursday (April 10).</li><li>The company cut down its staff from its Platform and Devices unit, claiming that they're focused on operating more effectively.</li><li>Google's original decision to merge the organization's OS and hardware teams was a key trigger for these layoffs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google laid off hundreds of employees from the Platforms and Devices unit on Thursday, April 10. This comes after the company has been pushing several employees to take voluntary exits for the past few months.</p><p>A source with direct knowledge of the situation told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-lays-hundreds-employees-android-pixel-group?rc=bdqvyp">The Information</a> that people working within the Android platform, Pixel phones, and the Chrome browser teams have been impacted by these layoffs.</p>
<p>In a statement to the publication, the tech giant said that since they combined the Android and Pixel teams last year, they've focused on, "becoming more nimble and operating more effectively." The Google spokesperson also stated that these cuts are in addition to the voluntary exit program the company offered to its employees in January.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-employees-from-pixel-and-android-teams-to-voluntarily-quit">voluntary layoffs program</a> first opened up for U.S. employees in teams that serve Android Auto, Android TV, Wear OS, and the recent Android XR platform, alongside a wide range of Google and Chrome products. However, in February,  the company expanded this program to the People Operations team as well.</p><p>At the time, a Google spokesperson told Android Central that "to support our People Operations team’s innovative work ahead, we’re opening new roles and offering a voluntary exit program with severance for their US-based employees.”</p>

<p>Like Meta and other major tech companies, Google is pivoting much of its manpower and resources to focus on AI advancement. Meta, too, has had several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-may-2023-layoffs">rounds</a> of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-social-media-reality-labs-layoffs-2024">layoffs</a> while touting the need for departments to be more "efficient."</p><p>Google said in May 2024 that it needed to focus on "moving faster" to improve generative AI development for Gemini. It seems like the company is cutting resources from other teams as a result.</p><p>Another reason for these layoffs could be that Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-reorg-changes-everything">merged Android and Chrome</a> under one "Platform and devices" umbrella, with SVP Rick Osterloh heading this group and the Pixel team. This merger could have led to redundancies. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-lays-hundreds-employees-android-pixel-group?rc=bdqvyp">The Information</a> states that this division numbered over 20,000 before the buyout offer and layoffs.</p><p>As of now, Google's total <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-lays-hundreds-employees-android-pixel-group?rc=bdqvyp">headcount is at 180,000 </a>despite laying off 6% (12,000 jobs) of its employees in 2023. This recent batch of layoffs isn't as massive but should still significantly impact these teams.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google for more information about the layoffs and we'll update this article once we hear more.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims ByteDance, the creators of TikTok, is pushing to create a pair of AI smart glasses.</li><li>The company is focusing on ensuring the gadget can capture "decent-quality" images and video without compromising its battery life.</li><li>During MWC 2025, Qualcomm and ByteDance announced a partnership to push ahead in the VR space and challenge Meta's Quest.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The developers behind TikTok, ByteDance, are reportedly looking to enter the competitive AI space with a new wearable.</p><p>Alleged intel received by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bytedance-developing-ai-smart-glasses">The Information</a> from "two people" close to the matter claims ByteDance is developing its pair of AI smart glasses. The publication states that while this isn't the company's first foray into AI — they've made AI-ready earbuds and other gadgets before — this will be its first attempt with something of a larger scale. Its sources state ByteDance has hired "engineers with experience in hardware design" for work on this project.</p><p>The Chinese company seems to have two major focuses in mind: "decent-quality" image and video capture.</p><p>ByteDance reportedly wants these two goals to be met with its AI smart glasses in a way that doesn't compromise the device's battery life. More importantly, all of this has supposedly started within the past year, which is when ByteDance allegedly began its AI glasses project.</p><p>Additional specifics about ByteDance's supposed AI smart glasses weren't discussed; however, the report claims the company has started "talking with suppliers" to determine the device's features. Speculation adds that talks about its specifications, cost, and launch are also underway.</p>

<p>In a way, perhaps there's merit behind these rumors, as during MWC 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2022#:~:text=to%20its%20potential.-,BEST%20XR%20ANNOUNCEMENT%20%E2%80%94%20QUALCOMM/BYTEDANCE,-(Image%20credit%3A%20Nicholas">Qualcomm and ByteDance</a> announced a partnership that was more than we expected. To be clear, this partnership was between the two companies to hash out a next-gen VR headset, which would likely take the fight directly to Meta and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest series</a>. It's also worth mentioning that ByteDance acquired VR headset maker Pico in August 2021, which is even more evidence pointing toward its increasing interest in consumer-focused AI products.</p><p>With ByteDance now reportedly seeking an AI-powered pair of lenses, Meta's Quest isn't the only product it has in its sights. The company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Ray-Ban glasses</a> are also in sight — but that's probably far off, at least with how the current rumors paint the picture.</p><p>Most people probably know ByteDance because of TikTok and its recent clash with the U.S. government and its more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">75-day reprieve</a>. TikTok avoided another ban in the U.S., which was previously set for April 5.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy Ring charges with a proprietary case, and previously that case was hard to replace in the event it was lost or damaged.</li><li>Now, anyone can easily buy a Galaxy Ring charging case for $90.</li><li>The size-specific cases are available through Samsung's online store, Best Buy, and Amazon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Replacement cases for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> are now widely available via Samsung and partner retailers, but they cost a staggering $90 — almost a fourth of the cost of a brand-new $400 Galaxy Ring. The cases were originally only sold through Samsung customer support, but are now found at Amazon and Best Buy, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/rings/galaxy-ring-charging-case-size-7-ep-qq507cwegus/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Samsung's online store</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/10/samsung-galaxy-ring-charging-case-replacement/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Galaxy Ring cases are required to charge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a>. After dropping the ring inside the case, contacts on the ring will connect to the case and start charging the device. The case has an internal battery for extra charging, and features a USB-C port on the back. This all means that if you lose your Galaxy Ring charging case, you'll have no way to charge the ring.</p><p>These cases are also size-specific to your Galaxy Ring, so you'll need to choose the size that matches when buying a replacement or spare charging case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VatnJ6pY3P8DFtkU2FBDbi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-charging-case-09.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring and its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VatnJ6pY3P8DFtkU2FBDbi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At $90, replacement cases aren't affordable by any means, but they are now widely available. If Galaxy Ring users lose or break their case, there is a good chance they can acquire a replacement quickly at a Best Buy retail store or online with Amazon. This will help <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> keep tracking without a hitch, and is a customer-friendly move.</p><p>Other smart wearable products with proprietary charging cases have similarly-expensive replacement fees, but they're harder to get quickly. For instance, if you lose a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> charging case while on a trip, you will be out of luck.</p><p>At the time of publishing, some replacement Galaxy Ring cases are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Charging-Portable-Crystal-Clear-Protective-EP-QQ500CWEGUS/dp/B0DMFW1CY5" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">as low as $75 on Amazon</a></p>

You&apos;re taking a slight hit in the battery size, but the Google Pixel 9 boasts more RAM, better cameras, and Wi-Fi 7 connectivity. </p>

<p>Why buy the new Pixel 9a when you can save a whopping $400 on the base model <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> at Mint Mobile today? Sure, you have to bundle with one year of wireless to receive the savings, but Mint is also carving 50% off its Unlimited plan for a limited time, which means you could get a great phone AND a full year of wireless for a single payment of $579 (or $49 per month using affirm). Compare that with the Pixel 9a's starting price of $499, and the choice is easy. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9af1600f-9267-4104-afa1-8bd9701ee53a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want an excellent Android phone with long software support, AI features, and some of the best cameras around; you live in an area with good T-Mobile coverage; you don&apos;t mind paying for a year of wireless in advance. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re happy with your current phone plan; you can get a better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9a-deals-of-the-month">Google Pixel 9a deal</a> through your wireless carrier.</p><p>Let&apos;s break down some of the numbers so you can see why this isn&apos;t your run-of-the-mill wireless deal. For starters, the budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Google Pixel 9a</a> starts at $499 while this Mint Mobile promo knocks the price of the superior Pixel 9 down to $399. The Unlimited annual plan won&apos;t break your budget either, as the deal knocks the price of the wireless down to a mere $180. </p><p>In other words, this offer gets you an excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and a full twelve months of unlimited, T-Mobile-powered wireless for $579, or just $80 more than buying the Pixel 9a unlocked. You can also use affirm and pay $49 per month for the phone-wireless combo. If that&apos;s not an incredible Pixel 9 deal, I don&apos;t know what is.</p>

How much will it cost, and what kind of specs should you expect? No matter what your question is regarding the upcoming Samsung flip phone, the answer can be found below.</p><p>For starters, I'll go ahead and say that you can pretty much count on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 getting revealed this summer. Samsung usually announces its newest generation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> during an Unpacked event in July or August, and there's no reason to think that this year will be any different.</p><p>We spend a lot of time gathering the most reputable leaks and rumors surrounding upcoming devices, and there's a lot to unpack (so to speak), so let's take a look at everything we know about the Z Flip 7 launch so far.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UFRGwVF3LTzpNBjdmRxwCm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-with-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-case-4.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 wearing a Z Flip 5 case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UFRGwVF3LTzpNBjdmRxwCm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung generally hosts two major "Unpacked" announcement events every year, one in January and one in July or August. Using past years as an indication — along with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">rumors and leaks surrounding the Z Flip 7</a> — we can predict with a fair amount of confidence that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will arrive this summer.</p><p>The clamshell device is expected to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, with one rumor suggesting that the Z Flip 7 will be equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">a new Exynos 2500 chipset</a>. The phone is also likely to launch with One UI 7 and Android 15, and you can expect the Z Flip 7 to come loaded with all of the latest Galaxy AI features.</p><p>A few rumors also seem to indicate that the Z Flip 7 will adopt the larger cover display that we've been hoping for (think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola's Razr Plus</a>, but more Samsung-y), plus the phone is likely to sport a new-and-improved hinge.</p><p>Lastly, some chatter has been suggesting that the Z Flip 7 will be announced alongside a new "Fan Edition" version of the phone. If it happens, this Galaxy Z Flip FE will probably feature a similar look to the standard model, but you'll get a slightly weaker processor and a lower price tag.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-launch-2">When will the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 launch?</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to be announced during an Unpacked announcement event in July or August, with an official release date landing several weeks after the reveal.</p><p>This estimate is based entirely on past releases of Samsung foldables — 2024's Galaxy Z Flip 6, for instance, was announced on July 10th and released on the 24th, while the Z Flip 5 was unveiled on July 26th, 2023 and released on August 11th.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xk33zq3Ca5579tvjuvpsre" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 display outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xk33zq3Ca5579tvjuvpsre.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="how-much-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cost-2">How much will the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cost?</h2>
<p>Considering that Samsung already increased the price of its foldable phones last year, I expect that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be unveiled with the same starting price as its predecessor. That's $1,099.99 for the 256GB version and $1,219.99 for 512GB of storage. Even if the price doesn't increase any further, that's still a pretty penny, so keep an eye out for preorder deals once the phone finally gets unveiled.</p>
<h2 id="will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-drop-in-price-2">Will the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 drop in price?</h2>
<p>While it's possible that the Z Flip 6 will become cheaper when the Z Flip 7 gets revealed, it's just as likely that the 2024 phone will simply run out of stock before any serious discounts get applied. Don't believe me? Do a quick Amazon search of 2023's Galaxy Z Flip 5 and see what you find.</p><p>On the bright side, retailers are sure to discount the Galaxy Z Flip 6 to clear stock <em>before</em> the new phone gets announced, particularly around the Amazon Prime Day sale event in July. Needless to say, Android Central will share the best Galaxy Z Flip 6 deals whenever they become available.</p>

Of course you did because you can't open the internet, turn on the television, or even look at the newspaper at the doctor's office without seeing everyone screeching about them.</p><p>The end goal of these tariffs is to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. I'm no economist and have no idea if this is going to work, but I do know that prices for things like phones are going to get a little crazy. It would be a great idea to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-is-winning-the-right-to-repair-race-with-pixel-9-series-manuals-and-guides">keep the phone you have as long as you can</a>.</p><p>It also means that you need to remember this when you buy your next phone and put repairability higher on your list.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/iphone-apple-tariffs-china-bb20c7a3?st=6LvXxe&" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> did a great job explaining how the cost to make a phone is going to rise, and you should have a look at it. Because it's a U.S. publication and the U.S. is iPhone-obsessed, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-apple-or-google">iPhone 16 Pro</a> is used for the example, but this same process goes for every phone or other piece of electronic gear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:693px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.99%;"><img id="uU7GNyNb5nL8ksBSNmVRq3" name="tariff-cost-increases" alt="Cost increases for the iPhone 16 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uU7GNyNb5nL8ksBSNmVRq3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="693" height="388" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Wall Street Journal, iFixit, TechInsights)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the cost to make a phone goes up by hundreds of dollars, the company making it is going to pass as much of it on to you as it can get away with. That means you'll be paying more — maybe a lot more.</p><p>I'm pretty certain that the "big" players in the U.S. economy (meaning giant corporations, of course) will do something to force changes before we hit some sort of economic collapse and have to think about eating each other. In the meantime, the stuff you love to buy and use is going to cost you. Being a tech enthusiast has always been a pay to play world.</p>
<p>Some people want to be the early adopters and buy something the minute it is released. That's cool, but the rest of us might want to keep what we have right now and use it for a few more years. That means it's important that the company making it supports it long enough, and that you can do minor repairs yourself or find someone who can do them for you.</p><p>I've mentioned several times how much I like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr</a>. It fits me, and I'm glad I finally decided to try using a flippy phone and ignore the crease. I also regret the purchase because if anything happens, the phone is e-waste. There's no way I can fix it myself, and the repair costs are going to be more than just buying something cheap like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel A phone</a>. I won't make this mistake again, and neither should you.</p>

<p>I know this is going to mostly fall on deaf ears, but we all need to stop buying phones that don't make it easy to replace the battery and the display. Full stop. I'm not suggesting we all run out and buy something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-wish-the-fairphone-5-was-coming-to-the-us">Fairphone</a> or one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD's new repairable models</a> (though, now that I think about it ...) but I am suggesting that a company that forces you to spend $400 to $500 to swap out a dying battery or cracked screen <strong>doesn't deserve your money</strong>.</p><p>In a worse-case-scenario you'll end up using the phone you have right now for two or three more years. I hate to tell you this, but you're going to hate it by then because the battery is going to suck. Batteries aren't designed to wear out quickly, but it is a by-product of the tech. High capacity and fast charging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">mean a limited lifespan</a>. And none of us can guarantee that we aren't going to crack the screen before we're ready to buy something else.</p>
<p>It may sound dumb, but this kind of pressure does work; we've seen it in action. Do you think companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">support their products for seven years</a> because they love us or because we complained and demanded it?</p><p>When you <em>do</em> go to buy your next phone, make sure you have a look at what it's going to cost to keep using it for a while.</p>

You were wrong if you figured they would be a short-lived fad or relegated to some niche corner where nobody paid any attention to them, and many people did. While not yet mainstream, they're not going away anytime soon.</p><p>They have their pros and cons, and some models do it better than others. One thing they all have in common is a big sheet of glass that can be bent across itself, then straightened back out (hopefully) hundreds of thousands of times.</p>
<p>It sounds a little bit crazy. I think most of us have broken glass and consider it fragile. It is. But with the right parts and the right techniques glass, like everything else, can be bent.</p>
<h2 id="folding-versus-bending-2">Folding versus bending</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-welcome" alt="One UI 7 welcome screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sitting in front of colorful plants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While a foldable phone may fold, the glass doesn't. Folding a sheet of glass would instantly break it, so instead it's bending, and yes there is a difference.</p><p>Take a sheet of paper and lay it on a table. Now grab the top corners and bring them to the bottom corners. You've bent the paper. If you apply pressure along the bend and create a crease, it's folded. Your foldable phone never allows the glass to fold, just bend.  this sounds a bit like nitpicking, but it matters.</p>
<p>Everything will bend if you make it thin enough. A framing timber in your roof won't bend, but a thin sheet of wood veneer or a branch on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bonsaiempire.com/basics/styling/wiring" target="_blank">Bonsai tree</a> will because it's thinner. If you apply enough pressure to bend a thick hunk of wood, it's going to break because of what's called tensile strength.</p><p>When glass, or anything else, bends, you're stretching the material <em><strong>outside </strong></em>the radius of the bend itself. A material's tensile strength determines how far it can be stretched before it breaks, and dense, thick materials are both stronger and harder to bend than thin materials. The force required to bend a thick piece of wood will cause it to break as soon as or right after it begins to bend.</p><p>By using a very thin sheet of glass, you're stretching less material and putting less tensile strain on it. This allows it to stretch and bend before it reaches its breaking point.</p><p>Don't get too hung up on this because it works just like you think it does — thin things are easier to bend without breaking. But thin glass is only one of the things that lets your foldable fold ... erm bend.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="bYYpsE9TK7qPYuLrhQA5sC" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on-25.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 closed hinge close up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bYYpsE9TK7qPYuLrhQA5sC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Making a phone with a glass screen that folds in half is a pretty amazing accomplishment. But as mentioned, the glass is just one piece of the puzzle.</p><p>That thin glass — often called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-z-flips-ultra-thin-glass-may-not-be-glass-after-all">UTG</a> for ultra-thin glass — isn't the same as the glass used on other phones. It's been treated in ways that allow it to stretch even more than it normally would.</p><p>The exact methods and materials used are company secrets, but different polymers are injected into the glass and used as a coating over the glass to allow for a lower tensile strain during the bending process. Making the glass as thin as human hair (thinner, actually) isn't enough.</p>
<p>Next, you have to make sure the glass doesn't touch itself while in the bent position, but you need to do it the right way. There are two reasons for this, but from a design standpoint, it is important that the least amount of bending be used to fold the body of the phone on itself. Ideally, there is a larger air gap at the bend point than the outside edges, and the outer case of the phone is built so that it's doing the touching instead of the glass itself. It doesn't matter if the phone is a flipper or a folder, the glass can't touch, and the point nearest to the bend will have a larger gap the the edge.</p>
<p>That's where the most important part of all this comes into play: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-5-display-durability-testing">the hinge</a>. Hinges have improved dramatically since the failure that was the first Samsung Galaxy Fold, but even that was an engineering feat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D36qT8zTVsJ4NCwZrceV5b" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Flip-2-review-10.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom V Flip 2 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D36qT8zTVsJ4NCwZrceV5b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A hinge must be designed to allow for fluid motion only in the way it was designed to, well, to hinge. You can't have unwanted linear force or any sort of warping during the process, and every time it moves, things must be very consistent. The hinge not only needs to be sturdy, stout, and precise; it needs to be durable as well. The 200,000th time the hinge folds needs to be the same as the first.</p><p>We see new hinge designs with every release cycle because it's the most important component of a foldable, even if it's not the most spectacular. There is no one correct way to accomplish this, and every company making foldable phones does things a little differently. They all have the same end goal, though: be strong enough to resist unwanted "twisting", be precise enough to meet design specifications, and be durable enough to do it hundreds of thousands of times before it fails.</p>
<h2 id="the-last-and-worst-piece-some-plastic-2">The last (and worst) piece: some plastic</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vkCxR4Vu6CQxMomk26Y7z8" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-14.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on Home Screen in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkCxR4Vu6CQxMomk26Y7z8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you were to grab a foldable phone and press really hard on the screen with your thumbnail, you would be able to put a tiny dent in it. This is because you're not really touching the glass itself; there is a thin layer of plastic covering it all. If you were to grab a first-generation foldable you would put a bigger dent on the screen using a lot less force because this process has been refined a lot in a few years. The latest phones <em>almost</em> feel like glass when you touch them.</p><p>This isn't done because phone makers love the feel of plastic, it's done for the same reason the glass can't touch itself when bent in half. The glass on a foldable phone needs to stay as defect-free as possible.</p>
<p>If you look at the screen on your "regular" phone very closely you'll find a bunch of very tiny scratches. These have almost no effect on the operation of your phone and most of the time you wouldn't even know there were there. But they are, and they would spell the death of a foldable.</p><p>Any defect — a chip or a scratch — in a piece of bendable glass creates a weak point that will be prone to expanding as the glass is stretched (on one side) and compressed (on the other side) during the bending process. That means the glass is going to crack where the defect is.</p><p>A non-removable screen layer of a thin, flexible plastic material over the glass acts as a sacrificial layer that will absorb the abuse instead of the glass getting it.</p>
<hr>
<p>A lot of different companies now make foldable phones in several different styles. Now you understand how it works a little bit and know how things will keep getting better each and every year.</p>

<p>Google wants the leeway to roll out its Pixel Watch 3 updates over a "few weeks in phases depending on carrier and device type." But when Google can't even <em>complete</em> its rollout before moving on to the next one, it's a sign that things need to change.</p><p>I have two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> units, a 45mm LTE and 41mm standard. Both are on the November 2024 update, which itself was just a delayed September 2024 re-rollout. That's nearly six months of unchanged software since I first reviewed it.</p><p>As someone with a Wear OS column, I had high hopes for Wear OS 5.1 coverage, like testing the new step-count algorithm, judging the UI changes, and deciding if the force-AOD dev tool should be a regular feature.</p><p>But the original March 4 update came and went, then the March 19 update window for LTE watches. But in my case, neither Pixel Watch 3 received it, no matter how often I tapped the update screen to trigger it. I tried factory resets in case old pre-release software from my review was holding back the update. Google told me it was "looking into" my case. But nothing helped.</p><p>Imagine my frustration as I see Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/336962016/google-pixel-watch-update-april-2025">April 2025 Wear OS update</a> community post, which notes that "For those that did not receive the original March update, we will be rolling out an update in the coming weeks, more details to come."</p><p>In other words, while people had been expecting the update to arrive any day now, Google either paused the update rollout because of bugs or had a bug <em>preventing</em> the rollout to some watches. Now we have more weeks to wait.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wanted to write this post weeks ago — explaining why I couldn't cover Wear OS 5.1 yet — but Android Authority's Rita El Khoury <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-buds-check-for-update-3533076/">made a similar case first</a> and my editor made me pivot.</p><p>Her point is pretty straightforward: right now, to check for an update, you go to Settings on your watch, tap System > System update, and then tap the screen frantically for about 30 seconds while the watch invisibly checks for an update.</p><p>It's a silly, unofficial method because your watch shouldn't say it's "up to date" if it hasn't checked yet. And if it's not available yet, you miss out on the initial enthusiasm and only get to test new features once everyone else has already moved on.</p><p>An obviously better system would be to let us tap a "Check for update" button in the Pixel Watch app, like you do with any phone update. But that only starts to fix the problem.</p>
<h2 id="better-clarity-on-timing-or-a-progress-bar-please-2">Better clarity on timing (or a progress bar), please</h2>
<p>Old Pixel Watch community posts always said the update would roll out "over the next week in phases." Anyone can wait a few days. Now these updates are requiring "weeks," and Google certainly didn't clarify in its March 2025 announcement that LTE owners would have to wait two weeks or more.</p><p>I understand why Google would focus on the larger non-LTE audience first, but the people who spent $450–500 on a premium model, only to consistently wait longer than everyone else, have reason to feel a little aggrieved. And all Pixel Watch owners deserve a bit more clarity on timing, if this is the new normal.</p><p>If Google doesn't want to commit to a written-down schedule matching specific devices to dates, then at the very least, it should have some kind of update widget showing the percentage of devices that (should) have received it. That way, people know whether they should continue to be patient or if something has gone wrong.</p>

<p>A month ago, I wrote that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-1-kicks-off-new-update-strategy-for-pixel-watches">Google's new quarterly Wear OS update plan</a> made sense. Let me be clear now: that opinion was predicated on the idea that I'd actually receive the updates.</p><p>I still think the system can work, but we're seeing a rise in large, buggy updates. The September 2024 update to Wear OS 5 required a weeks-long rollback due to bugs. Now this March 2025 update has introduced delayed notifications and crashes from adding watch faces — and there's the fact that not everyone received it.</p><p>I don't have the coding background to judge anyone for buggy updates. All I can do are point out common-sense solutions.</p><p>Samsung started its One UI 6 Watch beta test in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">June 2024</a>, then pushed out a stable version in late October. It had 4.5 months of Galaxy Watch superfans giving them beta feedback and pointing out bugs. When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> launched with One UI 6 Watch and the older watches updates, I didn't hear of any major software issues.</p><p>With a quarterly schedule, Google has consistent, months-long windows where willing Pixel Watch owners could test out new features and catch problems ahead of schedule — preventing time-wasting rollbacks. And for power users, it gives them a chance to try some features out early and feel like they're contributing to the community.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have to put this complaint into perspective: most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> only get one major update per year, and typically fall a year behind Pixel Watches. So waiting weeks for a feature or fixes isn't <em>that</em> big of a deal.</p><p>But if Google is going to stick with monthly or quarterly updates, then I don't think the status quo will work. It has too many models now, slowing down updates. And catching every bug without beta testing is starting to seem futile.</p><p>As is, the Pixel Watch 3's confusing, delay-heavy update schedule is only likely to annoy the people (like me) who would normally get <em>really excited</em> about tiny feature drops.</p>

<p>No, this is not a typo, but the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review"> OnePlus Watch 3</a> is open for users to buy as of April 10, but it comes with a huge price tag in the U.S.</p><p>Let's back up for a bit. In February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1iswu8a/oneplus_watch_3_meda_in_china_misspelled_on_the/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_body&embed_host_url=https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-watch-3-typo/" target="_blank">a Reddit user</a> noticed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-cant-use-meta-in-china-but-the-oneplus-watch-3-is-meda-in-china">minor error with the wearable</a>. The company ended up engraving "Meda in China" instead of "Made in China" on the first batch of wearables that went out.</p><p>After that, the company announced in a press release that it would be pushing the open sale of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3" target="_blank">Watch 3 </a>from Feb.25 to "sometime in April 2025."  The company needed some time to fix the typo that "slipped through" its first batch of watches. And it looks like today's the day that a China-based company decided to open sales for its smartwatch.</p>

<p>While people who wanted to get their hands on this wearable in the U.S. may see a massive surge in the pricing, the smartwatch which was initially supposed to cost $330, is now priced at $499— a $170 bump(as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-watch-3-launches-at-the-wrong-price/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>While we don't know for sure why the company suddenly chose to increase the price of its smartwatch without any communication, there's some chatter that it could be a typo or that the recently announced U.S.-China tariffs could be at play.  Starting today, President Donald Trump has levied a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/10/business/trump-tariffs-stocks">145% tariff</a> on products being imported from China, including electronics.</p><p>OnePlus told Android Central in an email "We don't have any additional information to share at this time." Hinting at the possibility that it could be due to the rising tensions between China and the U.S. due to this trade war.</p><p>But if you do plan on buying the OnePlus Watch 3, you could head to the company's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/buy-oneplus-watch-3?irclickid=TSsXXoS%3A1xyKTxK2oyXNtUqfUksy5pzHUXRQ1Q0&irgwc=1&utm_source=impact&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_content=Future%20PLC.&utm_term=ac-ca&utm_campaign=12532"> official website.</a></p>

<hr>
<p>Google has just wrapped up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/google-pixel-9a-launch-live-blog">Pixel 9a launch</a> on Thursday (Apr 20), and there's a new leak already revealing what Google's next smartwatch could look like. Renders of the Pixel Watch 4 have now surfaced and look pretty slick.</p><p>Leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer, widely known as OnLeaks, in collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-watch-4-design-renders-video/">91mobiles</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8UInUBIVaU">revealed </a>official-looking renders of the smartwatch. The successor of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> is likely to carry the popular circular design up front; however, the bezels are expected to be a lot thinner this year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad, today comes your very first look at the #Google #PixelWatch4 (360° video + sharp 5K renders + dimensions)!😏On behalf of @91mobiles 👉🏻 https://t.co/VhS5eS9d7R pic.twitter.com/wPOgVr86uY<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1910649694167994871">April 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While the back design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> remains majorly the same, one interesting omission appears to be the removal of pogo pins at the back, which are utilized to charge the smartwatch with an accompanying charger. Per the tipster, Google might be introducing wireless charging for the upcoming smartwatch as the necessary pins are nowhere to be seen in the renders.</p><p>Another new addition to the Pixel Watch 4, could be the addition of two new buttons on either side of the speaker, which are indicated by two cutouts in the renders. While the other noticeable difference could be the thickness of the Pixel Watch 4.</p>

<p>The publication indicates that the upcoming smartwatch would measure 14.3mm, which is notably thicker than the previous iteration which measured 12.3mm. The raised thickness is likely due to the inclusion of a larger battery, which is still a speculation at this point.</p><p>Lastly, the Pixel Watch 4 should be coming again in two sizes — 41mm and 45mm, the same as the predecessor model. Aside from the renders, very little is known about what to expect from the upcoming smartwatch from Google. Since the renders are now out, more details are expected to be coming in the weeks.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 should be launching alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> series in a couple of months from now, if the previous generation launches are any indication. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">renders</a> of the Pixel 10 models were also shared by OnLeaks very recently, giving us a clear picture of what to expect.</p>

<p>For entry-level wearable users, Garmin's Vivoactive line often serves as a great starting point, with the Venu series representing another step up. Now, there's a new Garmin Vivoactive 6, and it's available for purchase as of April 2025. How does it compare to the more expensive Garmin Venu 3, which launched way back in August 2023?</p><p>You might be surprised to learn that the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>, with better sensors and a more premium design, actually outpaces the newer Vivoactive 6 in a few areas. The problem is that you'll have to pay roughly $150 more for those extra features, so the Venu 3 is only a worthy upgrade over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Vivoactive 6</a> if you'll actually use them. Let's break down how these two entry-level and midrange fitness watches compare.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-venu-3-design-and-display-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Venu 3: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="W3NeCWhgzJFj5NMR63fLfJ" name="garmin-vivoactive-6-body-battery-press-photo" alt="A press photo of three Garmin Vivoactive 6 watches sitting side by side on tiny stairs.

<p>Garmin's Vivoactive 6 and Venu 3 smartwatches both feature a more subdued look and design language than some of its other wearables. These watches aren't rugged like the Instinct, sporty like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner</a>, or beefy like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Enduro</a>. Instead, they're the simple kind of stylish you can pair with a gym outfit or something in your daily wardrobe. The style represents the "casual" look both product lines are going for.</p><p>The Venu 3 comes in two sizes, with the Venu 3 being the bigger option and the Venu 3S the smaller one. The Venu 3 measures 45 x 45 x 12mm and weighs 30 grams without a strap, while the 3S measures 41 x 41 x 12mm and weighs 27 grams without a strap. By comparison, the Vivoactive 6 splits the middle in terms of its overall footprint, with a 42.2mm case size that's both thinner and lighter than both Venu models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JxUb9xDNrvsf3r5TjZdaDi" name="Garmin-Venu-3-watch-face.jpeg" alt="A close up of the Garmin Venu 3 showing a custom watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JxUb9xDNrvsf3r5TjZdaDi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Venu 3 on the wrist showing a custom watch face. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An advantage of the Vivoactive 6 is the smartwatch's support for standard 20mm quick-release watch bands, which can be interchanged easily. The Venu 3 uses 22mm straps and the Venu 3S uses 18mm straps, for reference. The included bands are silicone, but all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> can be upgraded with first-party or aftermarket straps.</p><p>As the higher-priced option, Garmin's Venu 3 has slightly more premium materials. It features a fiber-reinforced polymer case, like the Vivoactive 6, but sports a stainless steel bezel. On the Vivoactive 6, the bezel is made out of anodized aluminum. That's part of the reason the cheaper watch is also lighter on the wrist. It weighs just 37 grams, including the strap.</p>

<p>Both watches feature AMOLED displays. The Vivoactive 6 is equipped with a 1.2-inch panel with a 390 x 390 resolution, and the Venu 3S matches that specification exactly. The bigger Venu 3 has a 1.4-inch panel with a 454 x 454 resolution.</p><p>The Vivoactive 6 and Venu 3 also both feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/future-budget-android-phones-will-have-tougher-screens-thanks-to-cornings-new-glass">Gorilla Glass 3 coverings</a> and a 5ATM water-resistance rating.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-venu-3-hardware-and-features-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Venu 3: Hardware and features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SoxbEttapmCbcKsMDeEM2f" name="Garmin-vivoactive-6-press-photo" alt="A photo of four Garmin Vivoactive 6 watches, showing the four color options and various tools on the AMOLED displays like suggested workouts and images in messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SoxbEttapmCbcKsMDeEM2f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the Garmin Instinct 3, the Vivoactive 6 is a refreshed Garmin watch without the company's newest sensors. The Vivoactive 6 uses the Garmin Elevate v4 heart rate sensor, which is the same hardware found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-5-upgrades-amoled-and-battery">Vivoactive 5</a>. That means it won't get more accurate heart rate monitoring, ECG capabilities, and skin temperature detection.</p><p>It's unfortunate because the nearly two-year-old Venu 3 does come with the latest Garmin Elevate v5 sensor, which enables ECG and skin-temperature readings. As such, if you need the most advanced sensors, you'll need to pay $150 more for the Venu 3.</p><p>Otherwise, the two wearables are quite similar in terms of capabilities. Neither will have the kind of app support you'd get from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Wear OS watches</a>, but both feature 8GB of onboard storage for music. They both also support All-Systems mode for GPS, supporting GPS, GLONASS, and GALILEO.</p><p>The Vivoactive 6 takes it a step further with support for QZSS and BeiDou, but neither watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-phone-isnt-built-to-handle-hiking-and-im-sick-of-it">supports dual-band GPS</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of connectivity, both watches support Garmin Pay, Bluetooth, ANT+, and Wi-Fi. Aside from the barometric altimeter (Venu only) and the aforementioned different Garmin Elevate v4 and v5 sensors, the watches have the same assortment of sensors: pulse oximeter, accelerometer, ambient light sensor, compass, and gyroscope. The Venu 3's altimeter means it can accurately track elevation gains during runs or hikes, which the Vivoactive 6 can't.</p><p>The Garmin Vivoactive 6 can last up to 11 days on a single charge, while the Venu 3 can top out at 14 days. Both of those numbers will dip significantly the more you use music streaming, activity monitoring, and GPS. You'll charge them using the proprietary charging cable Garmin includes in the box.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-venu-3-which-should-you-buy-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Venu 3: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SicvCQA8CsHUG3TXoyQdmj" name="Garmin-Venu-3-watch-face-2.jpeg" alt="A close-up of a custom watch face on the Garmin Venu 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SicvCQA8CsHUG3TXoyQdmj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Garmin Vivoactive 6 and Venu 3 are designed for people who want essential fitness and health features in a slim and stylish package. The Vivoactive 6 has the advantage of being the newer release, but it doesn't make the most of it, with an older heart rate sensor than the Venu 3. That's why if you're looking for the absolute best casual Garmin watch, you'll need to pay for the Venu 3.</p><p>With that being said, if you're the kind of athlete or fitness buff who cares about the difference between Garmin's Elevate v4 and v5 sensors, the Venu 3 probably doesn't give you enough. Meanwhile, at just $300 and only a marginal downgrade from the Venu 3, the Vivoactive 6 remains the best entry-level Garmin you can buy — even if it's not a massive upgrade over the Vivoactive 5.</p>

Still, it's an excellent watch for casual users who just need basic fitness and health monitoring at a fair price.</p></p>

<p>Let's start with a similarity, such as their cameras on the same upper left side. The Moto G 2025 has a more square look since it only has two cameras, unlike Samsung's more vertical camera look, thanks to the triple camera setup.</p><p>Both phones have the same-sized display and share a plastic build that helps reduce weight and manufacturing costs. However, Motorola gives its phone a more refined touch with a vegan leather back. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review" target="_blank">In his review</a>, Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich said that he loved holding the phone because of the vegan leather back and noted the phone felt lighter than its actual weight. Rounded corners on both phones also make them more comfortable to hold.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A26 vs. Moto G 2025 analysis also reveals that both phones have a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for quick access to the phone.</p><p>When it comes to differences, the Moto G 2025 is slightly thicker, measuring 167 x 76.3 x 8.2mm thick, compared to the Samsung Galaxy A26, which measures 164 x 77.5 x 7.7mm.</p><p>Samsung also wins in durability, offering a reinforced layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+, while the Moto G 2025 uses the older Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Another win for Samsung is the IP67 rating, which makes the phone dust-tight and submersible in up to one meter of fresh water. The Moto G 2025, in contrast, is only water-repellent.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1188px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JT3RhN6rpND3aVvVt3D5Qa" name="Samsung Galaxy A26 all colors" alt="All colors of the Samsung Galaxy A26" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JT3RhN6rpND3aVvVt3D5Qa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1188" height="668" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of hardware and specs, both phones share a huge 5,000mAh battery, USB Type-C 2.0, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot, and a side-mounted fingerprint sensor.</p><p>Both phones share the same 6.7-inch display but differ in the type of technology used. The Moto G 2025 has an IPS LCD 120Hz display, while the Samsung Galaxy A26 has a Super AMOLED 120Hz panel, offering deeper blacks and vibrant colors.</p><p>When it comes to screen resolution, Samsung takes the lead with a sharper Full HD+ 2400 x 1080, while the Moto G 2025 settles for a lower HD+ 1600 x 720 resolution. This means the Galaxy A26 will give you a crisper look when watching videos, reading text, or browsing, thanks to its 385 ppi pixel density, compared to Moto's 262 ppi.</p><p>Even with a few similarities, the phones have their differences. The Moto G 2025 has a less powerful Mediatek Dimensity 6300 processor, while the Galaxy A26 has a more powerful Exynos 1380 chipset. There is also a difference in the charging speeds, with the Moto G 2025 having a better 30W wired and the Galaxy A26 falling behind with a 25W.</p><p>The camera specs are also different. Samsung offers the Galaxy A26 a 50MP wide, 8MP ultrawide, and a 2MP macro, giving you more flexibility for group and landscape shots. The Moto G 2025, on the other hand, has a 50MP wide, and a 2MP macro, lacking an ultrawide camera, thus limiting your shooting options.</p><p>Samsung offers more storage options, letting you choose between 4GB/128GB, 6GB/128GB, 8GB/128GB, and 8GB/256GB options. On the other hand, Motorola only offers 4GB/64GB and 4GB/128GB variants.</p>

<p>The Moto G 2025 uses a near-stock OS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box. Motorola gives this model two years of major Android upgrades and three security updates. While that’s an improvement over previous Motorola phones, it falls short of Samsung’s commitment to six years of software and security support. However, Motorola stands out by delivering a near-stock experience with minimal pre-installed apps, making the interface feel more customizable and lighter, which is ideal for users who prefer simplicity.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A26, on the other hand, runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-7-is-here-and-google-is-taking-widgets-seriously-again">One UI 7</a> based on Android 15. This software offers new visuals, such as updated widgets and icons, split Quick Settings, smoother animations, and a Notification Pane.</p><p>With the update, you also enjoy a flashy new animation when you charge your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> and helpful gestures for adjusting brightness. Samsung also added a dedicated panel and useful gestures for turning on Dark mode. There are also camera updates making it easier to access modes in one-handed use.</p><p>The Moto G 2025 may not offer the features or refined design of Samsung’s One UI, but its near-stock Android approach has advantages. With fewer pre-installed apps, the interface feels lighter, more customizable, and easier to navigate.</p><p>Ultimately, it all comes down to whether you prefer Motorola’s clean, minimal approach or Samsung’s more feature-rich experience and additional years of updates.</p>

<p>Both phones come with Android 15 and feature similarly-sized displays, but they differ in several important ways. The Galaxy A26 offers better water resistance with an IP67 rating, making it more likely to survive accidental splashes or spills.</p><p>The Galaxy A26 also has a more powerful processor for smoother multitasking and an ultrawide camera for landscape and group pictures. Samsung provides six years of software and security updates on the software front, while Motorola offers two years of software and three years of security updates.</p><p>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy A26 vs. Moto G 2025 standoff has clarified that Samsung has better specs in various areas and longer-lasting software support, making it a more tempting offer. It boasts better value overall and is designed to last longer than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>.</p>

<p>Wireless charging isn't the most efficient method of recharging anything. Most wireless chargers tend to run super hot, which is unsafe and wastes energy at the same time. Accessory brand TORRAS has a solution to combat this unnecessary heat generation. The brand's PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger has a built-in cooling fan, keeping your device nice and breezy.</p><p>TORRAS started out as a smartphone case maker, but the Chinese brand has since expanded into other accessories, such as phone stands, grips, chargers, and even power banks. The design language is minimal across the portfolio, with many concepts reminiscent of ESR's offerings.</p>

<p>The PolarCircle is meant to be a jack of all trades, combining 15W Qi2 wireless charging with a cooling fan and a rotating phone stand. You can even use the sturdy rotating stand as a grip since it boasts a ring-like structure. Since this is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/qi2">Qi2</a> accessory, it works with MagSafe devices perfectly as well.</p><p>I was expecting a plug-and-play experience with the TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger. As a person who spends six out of seven days a week—sometimes even all seven — testing accessories, it took me an embarrassing amount of time to figure this thing out.</p><p>Fortunately, the fine print on the tiny little user manual walks you through the steps with illustrated diagrams. I still feel like TORRAS needs to uncomplicate the process of turning on the cooling fan. It's not user-friendly at all, requiring you to press and hold the button, unplug and then replug the cable to get the blades spinning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sp46TnQHiReJzgbrkxB7Rc" name="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" alt="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sp46TnQHiReJzgbrkxB7Rc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wireless charging works as it should with the TORRAS PolarCircle, functioning smoothly with both Android and iOS devices during my review. The cooling fan does an amicable job of heat reduction, keeping the center of the device frosty. This prevents stutters and overheating issues on your phone, so you can use it while charging.</p><p>It's not the "coolest" accessory I have ever used, though. That award goes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Black-Shark-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B09CGTLDB7/">Black Shark's magnetic coolers</a>. However, the TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger's temperature control is adequate for wireless charging purposes.</p><p>The charger is built well, and even though the ring-like stand is thin, it feels durable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8gKAksDf4UHcDnRKz87GBc" name="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" alt="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8gKAksDf4UHcDnRKz87GBc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3766" height="2118" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TORRAS includes a 5-foot-long <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C to USB-C cable</a> in the box, which is a pleasing length. That's a generously long cable — competitors, please take note. We don't want measly little 2ft cables, which is what most brands like Anker provide. This is the gold standard of cable lengths.</p><p>Overall, the $59.99 price tag gives you excellent value for your money. TORRAS frequently discounts its products, so you can easily score the PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger for less than $50. At the time of writing, you can get it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV/">$42.49 from Amazon</a>.</p><p>I don't think you can expect a multipurpose accessory like this to be any cheaper. It's a fantastic deal, considering good-quality coolers set you back $30 to $40 alone. Add the cost of a 15W Qi2 wireless charger and a MagSafe PopSocket, and you're already looking at a hefty bill, with the combined total reaching $100 if you add a 5ft USB-C cable.</p><p>So, if your phone tends to overheat while charging, try the budget-friendly TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger!</p>

While there are several styles and designs in this emerging category, most manufacturers went with an ear hook design to position the audio driver just outside the ear cavity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qJGhsFRrS42dnXwqjH3XCM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJGhsFRrS42dnXwqjH3XCM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>SoundPEATS is taking a different direction. Its PearlClip Pro earbuds have a unique design that clips over the ears, and it somehow works. The design means it will be disorientating when you start using the earbuds — it took me a while to understand how to wear these correctly — but once they're nestled in your ears, they're pretty comfortable. These buds usually cost $69, but they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.amazon.com/SoundPEATS-Ear-Earbuds-Headphones-Clip/dp/B0DLNYJ3YR">now on sale for just $42</a>, and that's a great value.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JMUPioFJAiGRNKYvVJaZ9M" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JMUPioFJAiGRNKYvVJaZ9M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike most open earbuds, the PearlClip Pro nestle into the ear canal a little, but they're still much better in this area than regular earbuds. Coming in at 5.85g, they're on the lighter end of the scale, but I noticed a little strain around the lower portion of my ear lobe after wearing these buds for an extended amount of time. The fit does take some getting used to, and I'd recommend trying out the earbuds to see if you like the way they nestle around the ear.</p>

<p>The unique way they're positioned around the ear means they look a little goofy at times, and in the two times I walked around with these on, I got quite a lot of stares. Interestingly, the earbuds don't have traditional left/right channels — they're interchangeable. The only other audio product I used that had this design was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/meze-99-classics-review">Meze 99 Classics</a>, so you don't have to worry if you're wearing the correct earbud in each ear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zrNND7xwEABZ9VDQcis7CM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zrNND7xwEABZ9VDQcis7CM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sound is pretty good; it has a 12mm driver and weighty bass along with a cleanly defined mid-range and articulated highs, and I didn't see any issues when listening to diverse genres. I will note that the positioning of the buds makes all the difference when it comes to sound quality, so you'll need to make sure they're slotted in just right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DMx8Aq7QqENhTkXfxVSMCM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DMx8Aq7QqENhTkXfxVSMCM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each bud has a tiny 35mAh battery, with the case housing a 350mAh battery. It takes an hour to charge the buds within the case, and two hours to charge the battery on the case itself. Battery life is quite decent too, with the buds lasting over five hours on a single charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nH8i8PmUzGRJFgN2zWSYBM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nH8i8PmUzGRJFgN2zWSYBM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The case itself doesn't stand out, but it is easily pocketable, and at 47g, it doesn't weigh much. You get IPX5 water resistance, so you can use these buds while running or exercising, and they don't wiggle out of the ear even while running. The PearlClip Pro gets a lot right, and while the fit definitely takes some time to get used to, I'll admit that they're much more comfortable than I initially imagined. If you want open earbuds with a unique design that stands out, should consider these.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Cloud Next 2025 is officially here, and the first set of developer-focused announcements haven't disappointed. This week, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-flash-pro-live-api-veo-2-gemini-api/" target="_blank">announcing</a> that its Veo 2 video-generation model is production ready and widely available for use via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> API in Google AI Studio. Additionally, the company confirms that Gemini 2.5 Flash — a streamlined thinking model for basic tasks — is "coming soon."</p><p>As a video-generation model, Google says that Veo 2 is "able to follow both simple and complex instructions, as well as simulate real-world physics in a wide range of visual styles." Veo 2 will work with both text or image prompts, or both. This means you could describe to Veo 2 what you want your AI-generated video to turn into, provide the model with an image to work with, or a blend of the two options.</p><p>Users can try out<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-app-video-generation-veo-2-code-spotted"> Veo 2</a> in the Google AI Studio, and it can produce videos at 720p resolution at 24 frames per second. Currently, the big limitation is length. Videos created with Veo 2 can only be a maximum of eight seconds long. As an enterprise-grade tool, Veo 2 costs $0.35 per second of video generated.</p><p>As an example of what the model can do, Google shows off what Wolf Games is doing with Veo 2 in the video below.</p>

<p>The blog post also included a quick teaser that Gemini 2.5 Flash is on the way. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">Gemini 2.5 family of AI models</a> debuted last month and has been progressing at a rapid pace. It first became available as a Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model exclusive to subscribers, only to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">become available for free users days later</a>. Now, we have an idea of what Google is planning for the Flash variant.</p><p>"This evolution of our popular workhorse model will maintain low latency and cost-efficiency while incorporating thinking capabilities," the company said.</p><p>Finally, Google announced that the Live API for Gemini is now available in preview. This tool is designed to help with real-time interactions and "enables developers to build applications and agents that process streaming audio, video and text with low latency."</p><p>You can expect more announcements to come out of Google Cloud Next 2025, which is currently ongoing. Just yesterday, the company announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-releases-enterprise-grade-gemini-tier-in-android-studio">a new Gemini version for Android Studio</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google's A-series lineup of Pixel phones tends to be controversial. It's a mid-cycle release, which typically comes after the base-model Pixel is heavily discounted, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-shouldve-merged-the-pixel-9-and-9a">leaving a ton of feature overlap</a>. This year's Google Pixel 9a is more of the same but with a twist. To find out whether the money spent on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9">the midrange Pixel 9a is better than the flagship Pixel 9</a>, I tested both side-by-side for almost two weeks.</p><p>For the first time in recent memory, the Pixel 9a has a completely different design than the base Pixel 9 — kind of. The general oval-shaped camera cutout is still present on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>, but the iconic Pixel 9 camera bar is gone. With this change, the Pixel 9a's back is <em>almost </em>completely flat, but not all the way.</p><p>Starting with the good, it's nice that the Pixel 9a doesn't rock when it's on a flat surface. Despite being thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, it doesn't feel gargantuan in the hand. The device measures just 154.7mm x 73.3mm x 8.9mm, which is only 0.4mm thicker than the standard Pixel 9. That extra space adds 400mAh of battery capacity, which sounds like a worthy tradeoff.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H5QcxrTXFDs6ZWZZYYtkKj" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-5" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H5QcxrTXFDs6ZWZZYYtkKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also nice that the nearly-flush camera lenses will help the back become completely flat when paired with even the thinnest cases. I have found that the exposed glass covering, without a camera bar to protect it, makes the Pixel 9a camera housing more susceptible to scratching or collecting dust.</p><p>In terms of materials, the Pixel 9a's matte plastic back doesn't feel as satisfying as the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, but that could be simply due to the lack of curves. The panel is completely flat, like the Pixel 9, embracing the rectangular design language of 2025 smartphones. Compared to the Pixel 9's glass back, neither phone feels inherently more premium than the other.</p><p>With that being said, the Pixel 9a looks bland and dull <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">without the instantly-recognizable Pixel camera bar</a>. I look at the Pixel 9 and know immediately that it's a Google smartphone, and just don't feel that same familiarity with the Pixel 9a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PfkXdYApkKnbdyzWbzrd45" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfkXdYApkKnbdyzWbzrd45.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The displays are both excellent-quality 6.3-inch p-OLED panels, with the Pixel 9a having bigger bezels than the standard Pixel 9. You can see the difference when the phones are next to each other, but I never noticed the bezels getting in the way during daily use. Both devices offer up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness, and the same resolution, so this isn't a reason to choose one over the other.</p>

<h2 id="performance-will-surprise-you-2">Performance will surprise you </h2>
<p>Things start to get tricky under the hood, with the Pixel 9a and the Pixel 9 sharing the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 chip</a> but with different memory configurations. The higher-priced Pixel 9 gets 12GB of RAM, while the cheaper Pixel 9a only gets 8GB. This means that while the Pixel 9 can run the Gemini Nano XS model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">the Pixel 9a has the Gemini Nano XXS model instead</a>.</p><p>In practice, the Pixel 9a lacks certain AI staples on day one, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a>. Although the Pixel 9a gets the same seven-year OS upgrade and feature drop promise as the Pixel 9, it stands to reason that the former will get fewer features over time due to hardware limitations.</p>

<p>The really odd part of this is the Pixel 9a's benchmark scores. The Pixel 9a consistently beats the Pixel 9 in Geekbench 6 (trust me, I ran these multiple times to be sure). I can't figure out why, considering the Pixel 9 has the same chip and more available RAM, but can confirm that the Pixel 9a feels fast, smooth, and reliable during daily use. There wasn't any noticeable overheating either, despite testing in the Arizona desert.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-cameras-compare-2">How the cameras compare</h2>
<p>The positives continue as the Pixel 9a reverses a worrying trend of Google phones delivering photos with inaccurate colors. I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">full review of the Pixel 9a camera system</a>, but the short version is that the new 48MP main camera brings the midranger closer in line with flagship offerings.</p><p>It adds features like Macro Focus, all while improving computational photography and color science, as you can see in the samples below.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, the Pixel 9's 50MP main sensor is significantly larger in sensor size than the Pixel 9a's camera. It also sports a 48MP ultrawide that will produce more detailed shots than the Pixel 9a's 13MP ultrawide lens. Both cameras will perform great in daylight, but the Pixel 9 is the clear winner in nighttime photography.</p>

<p>For most people, the Google Pixel 9 is objectively the better value than the cheaper Pixel 9a. When you look past the $799 retail price on paper, you'll realize that it's quite easy to find a Pixel 9 for only slightly more than the Pixel 9a. Both Amazon and Best Buy have the Pixel 9 discounted to $649 at the time of publishing, with the latter offering a $100 discount if you activate the phone at the time of purchase.</p><p>Yes, that means you could get a Pixel 9 — with more memory, a better camera, and a better screen — for just $50 more than a Pixel 9a. It's not hard to get it for even less if you're willing to take advantage of carrier contract deals (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone">be careful of those</a>) or trade-in promotions.</p><p>Aside from the price, I feel much more confident that the Pixel 9 will get more features and updates over its software support window than the Pixel 9a due to the extra memory. Beyond that, the slimmer bezels, glass back, camera bar, and better display are just bonuses. That's why I think the Pixel 9 is the better buy for most people unless you're specifically looking for a basic Android phone with a long battery life.</p>

<p>Originally, I was ready to write off the Google Pixel 9a due to its debut limitations. With just 8GB of RAM, it isn't able to run the latest Pixel-exclusive AI tools on day one, let alone future tools that may be released years down the road. However, I soon realized that this might not only be acceptable to prospective Pixel 9a buyers — it could be preferable.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is decisively for the no-nonsense kind of Android phone user. It's made for the kind of person that will gladly take a conventionally-ugly smartphone with multi-day battery life. Or, the kind of person that thinks having fewer AI features shoved on their phone is a feature, not a bug. For those people, who just want a basic and good Android phone, there might not be something better than the Pixel 9a.</p>

According to several users on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oneui/">subreddit post,</a> Samsung has started rolling out the OS more widely today (April. 10) as promised in the company's rollout strategy announcement last month.</p><p>The first ones to see this software update pop up on their phones are those with either the Samsung S24 series phones or the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6, much like how the rollout happened in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">Korea</a>.</p>

<p>Several users have been waiting with bated breath for this UI to drop since they saw some of its fun features pop up in beta versions of the OS. The build has rolled out on a larger scale but it seems to be rolling out to beta users first.</p><p>The highly anticipated  Android 15-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> update, seems to be around 5.2GB in size and comes with Samsung's April security patch. With this update, Samsung promises to take its AI experience to the next level. Giving users enhanced writing tools, image generation and more.</p><p>To check if your phone has received the One UI 7 update, head to <strong>Settings > Software Update > Check for updates</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-from-the-one-ui-7-2">What to expect from the One UI 7</h2>
<p>For starters, AC's Harish Jonnalagadda is calling this, Samsung's best software update yet and for good reason. Right off the bat, once the OS is downloaded and ready to go, users can see the change with the Notification panel. Samsung has now split the controls with the toggles sitting on one side, and the notifications on the other. But this can be customized to a "unified-panel" with all the controls together.</p><p>The One UI 7 brings with it a vertically-scrolling app drawer, ditching the horizontal app drawer. Other than that, this update brings the belowed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a>," the pill- shaped bar at the botoom of your lock screen that shows media controls, timer, recorder, navigation, and other ongoing actions.</p>

<p>Other features include Live Notifications that show up on the status bar, the camera interface also seems to have got a fresh coat of paint making it much more organized, among others. Here's a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review#section-samsung-actually-added-a-vertically-scrolling-app-drawer"> full list </a>of what you can expect once you've successfully updated your phone to the latest One UI 7.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung is said to expand its software update to older eligible devices (Galaxy Z Fold 4/ Flip 4/ 3, S23 FE, A34, A35, S22/ S21 series, Tab S9/S8 series, A16) by May.</p><p>The update has rolled out to some of AC's  staff in the U.S. who own a Galaxy S24 series device. So if you aren't seeing an update pop up on your phones as yet, don't worry as the rollout seems to be happening in phases.</p>

<ul><li>Google's April security patch has started rolling out the entire Pixel lineup, including the latest Pixel 9a.</li><li>The patch solves a few camera issues for several Pixel series while also solving the brightness drop problem some users faced in March.</li><li>The security update arrives just as Google's Pixel 9a hits the market for all to purchase.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's expected monthly security patch is starting to make its rounds for its Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>Today (Apr. 10), Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/337176484/google-pixel-update-april-2025">posted the changelog</a> for the April 2025 security patch that involves its entire Pixel lineup. The company has shifted its version numbers slightly for users with different devices. According to the post, users with a Pixel 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a>, or Pixel Tablet will download v<strong>BP1A.250405.007</strong>. Users with a Pixel 7, 7a, Pixel 8, or 8a will see <strong>B1 </strong>attached to the end of the version. Additionally, the latest Pixel 9a will see BD4A.250405.<strong>003</strong>.</p><p>The patch notes this month are light but feature fixes for Google's Pixel camera. It states the update brings a fix for "camera stability" for users when zooming in or out in "certain conditions." This patch rolls in for the Pixel 6 and 7 series, as well as the original Fold.</p><p>Google is also rolling in another fix for the display for its entire Pixel lineup. The company says this fix should solve the pesky brightness flickering issue users suffered when using a streaming app.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fix for issues with fingerprint recognition and response under certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with overlapping views on lockscreen weather clock under certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with Pixel Launcher when creating a new user or switching users under certain conditions</li></ul>

<p>One of the significant takeaways from Google's April update is the long-awaited fix for the annoying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">brightness fluctuation issues</a> users reported in March. The issue seemingly spurred off the company's March <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">feature drop</a>, which brought a hefty amount of new features for Pixels and the Pixel Watch. Many users with phones from the Pixel 7 to the Pixel 9 reported their device's display brightness would "abruptly drop" when watching Netflix or Prime Video.</p><p>A temporary fix users found was to alter the device's fresh rate, but Google's official patch should remove the necessity for that.</p><p>Another issue that Google did not mention <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported">concerns Pixel alarms</a>. Some users were waking up late in March as their Pixels — surprisingly — automatically disabled some alarms, leading to late starts for work. Aside from that, issues continued for Pixel users who reported <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-weather-widget-desync-old-forecasts-reported">desynced weather forecasts</a>.</p><p>Users stated they were seeing outlooks that were days old, which isn't <em>exactly </em>what you'd want. Google jumped on this promptly, informing Android Central that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-weather-widget-desync-old-forecasts-reported">had started rolling out a fix</a> for affected users.</p><p>Also, you might want to check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">the all-new Pixel 9a</a>, which breaks the mold for performance and visuals that some flagships just can't match.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster discovered signs in Android Auto's code that seemingly points toward smart glasses integration.</li><li>Strings of code mention a "Glasses" option and the ability for users to "start navigation" with their glasses.</li><li>This discovery surfaces a day after Google's TED 2025 demo, where it showcased its Android XR glasses "memory" capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent code discovery purports a truly interesting feature in development for Google's driving ecosystem.</p><p>Development for a curious new integration in Android Auto was spotted in an APK dive by AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-smart-glasses-apk-3543456/">Android Authority</a>. Alongside the tipster, the publication discovered two new strings in Android Auto's recent version that both contain a "GLASSES" modifier. The first string is simply the option itself, which is for a "Glasses Option."</p><p>While nothing concrete surfaced, this code only adds an option for this new feature, likely within its settings/features list.</p><p>The second string is more interesting as Google's early added code reads, "Start navigation to launch Glasses." By the code's name, it seems Google is working on integrating Android Auto's console information with a user's connected pair of smart glasses for AR assistance. Speculation leans this way, too; however, how these alerts or bits of navigational information could appear is unknown.</p><p>This code was noticed in v14.2.151544 of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>, and since things are still barebones, we're likely still far from knowing more.</p>
<h2 id="google-s-future-of-android-xr-glasses-2">Google's Future of Android XR Glasses</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXVvvRhiGjI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The timing of this discovery only pushes us in one direction: Google's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">TED 2025 demo</a> of its Android XR glasses. The highlight of the demo was the glasses' "memory" ability. The demoer, product manager Nishtha Bhatia, asked Gemini where she'd left her hotel room key. Since she was wearing her XR glasses — and Gemini was being attentive — the AI was able to respond with, "The hotel key card is to the left of the music record."</p><p>Bhatia was able to relocate her key card on the shelf behind her, where the music record was.</p><p>Elswhere, Google stated, "These glasses work with your phone, streaming back and forth, allowing the glasses to be very lightweight and access all of your phone apps." With that in mind, there's a chance Android Auto could bring similar possibilities to Google's XR glasses.</p><p>If we're keeping things lightweight, the "Glasses" option would simply retrieve the information from your car's onboard software instead of trying to load up maps in its frame. Google's TED 2025 demo also showed a pair of glasses that only feature a screen in one lens. The company previously showed off glasses with one display and another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">with two screens in 2023</a>, so it seems there are plans for multiple options.</p>

<p>Whenever someone gets their first VR headset, Job Simulator is almost always one of the first games they'll play. The game is as ubiquitous with virtual reality gaming as Beat Saber is and this has earned developer Owlchemy Labs quite the pedigree over the years. For that reason, the company's latest game, Dimensional Double Shift, immediately caught my eye.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/dimensional-double-shift/4449903565103159/">Dimensional Double Shift</a>, or DDS as I'll call it from now on, can be described essentially as a multiplayer Job Simulator. While Job Simulator sees you taking your time as one of four jobs, DDS splits the workload between two main job types to finish as many duties as you can within a shift. Each job supports up to four players, and you'll find that jobs change based on how many players are in the game and what workstations they're at.</p><p>While DDS is still a free-to-play game on the Meta Quest platform, the new Hexas dimension is the first paid DLC to debut. For $4.99, players will unlock Hexas and all the cheeky swag that comes along with it. Anyone can play in Hexas so long as at least one person in the party owns the pack, you just can't earn those sweet accessories unless you pay the $5. It's a great business model that mirrors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/walkabout-minigolf-meta-quest-mars-gardens">Walkabout Mini Golf</a> and ensures that everyone gets to have fun even if they don't have money to spare.</p>

<p>Hexas debuts the launch of public lobbies, as well as a completely new dimension to experience the cooking and mechanic jobs in. While the base jobs are the same concept, the ingredients, stations, and even mechanics of them can be wildly different.</p><p>Let's cover the basics first. DDS is a hand tracking-only game, meaning you'll toss those controllers aside and feel the sweet relief of your God-given hands in the air. The game's controls are weirdly tactile, given that you're <em>just grabbing air</em> the whole time, thanks to a unique system where items lock to your hand until you perform an obvious "letting go" gesture. That means you just dramatically open your hand very quickly to drop something.</p><p>Players start out in a lobby of sorts with two jobs to choose from: cooking or mechanic work. With Hexas, the dimension chosen is randomized, so you never know when you'll get to fix cars in Hell. You'll just have to play to see when it finally happens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmQVSRmyCSoGaR9RcYdgue" name="dimensional-double-shift-hexas-official-screenshot-06" alt="Filling up a demon head in Dimensional Double Shift's mechanic job on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmQVSRmyCSoGaR9RcYdgue.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Owlchemy Labs)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've played Job Simulator, Vacation Simulator, Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, or Cosmonious High, you'll immediately feel at home with the game's mechanics. As a cook, you'll grab an order ticket and assemble it as quickly as you can, and the fastest players will complete more orders than everyone else. The mechanic job is more about teamwork since the entire team works on a single car rather than individual vehicles.</p><p>Owlchemy Labs games are wildly creative and are best enjoyed by people who enjoy role playing and exploration. As the CEO of Owlchemy Labs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-wishlist-2024">once told me</a>, the best VR games "let you roleplay and don't put exposition in the way of your roleplaying."</p><p>That means when you start a job in Dimensional Double Shift, the workstation is your canvas. Each work station has completely different tools and machines with which to work. You don't move between stations during a shift, ensuring that teamwork is required when one person's problem requires a tool or part they don't have immediate access to.</p><p>Like all other Owlchemy Labs games, this is built for players with all sorts of heights and abilities, so you can adjust the height of your workstation on the fly, pass parts and ingredients between players, use hand gestures and your voice to communicate with other players, and so forth.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U33o3WM5gFEX9SHzX36pue" name="dimensional-double-shift-hexas-official-screenshot-04" alt="Growing plants with blood in Dimensional Double Shift's cook job on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U33o3WM5gFEX9SHzX36pue.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Owlchemy Labs)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>DDS's first dimension, Treeattle, is a parody play on the hipster hippy culture you might find in suburban and downtown Seattle. Hexas, likewise, is a parody of the larger-than-life attitudes and lifestyles you'll find in Texas, just with a demonic twist for comedic effect.</p><p>As with any good Owlchemy game, DDS rewards players for thinking outside of the box and combining items that otherwise might not go together. It also heavily leans into the alternate dimension concept where cars might have milkable udders or demonic patrons might enjoy a literal <em>bloody</em> Mary drink.</p><p>Everything is so ridiculous that it ups the fun factor even beyond what was in the original dimension, and the humor is just the right mix between older-kid-friendly and still hilarious to adults who understand the references.</p>

<p>As I've written about several times before, I love playing VR games with my family. Whether it's Dungeons of Eternity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">with my son</a> or Walkabout Mini Golf <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/at-home-date-nights-are-better-in-vr-no-seriously">with my wife</a>, there's  a real joy that comes with playing VR games with other people. For that reason, I absolutely had to play this one with them and the results couldn't have been better.</p><p>My son typically hates hand tracking games, but Owlchemy Labs has been perfecting hand tracking since Job Simulator and it shows. He didn't once complain about not being able to use controllers — something that's never happened with other hand tracking games — and was moving around with the precision normally only associated with using motion-tracked VR controllers.</p><p>My wife also enjoyed the heck out of the game, especially during the mechanic section when we had to co-op fix several different broken car parts. It was like putting both our hands on a physical puzzle and working together to solve it. The teamwork was amazing.</p>

<p>Owlchemy's CEO, Andrew Eiche, told me the company is already hard at work on the next big update. While he didn't commit to what sorts of new jobs we can look forward to, I'm confident that the next update will once again reinvent what DDS players have come to expect.</p><p>Now that lobbies can be publicly searched, it'll be significantly easier to find players online when you're friends (or family) aren't available to play. Given how great Owlchemy's previous games were when played in a room with other people, it shouldn't come as to any surprise that this game is a <strong>blast</strong> to play online.</p><p>Owlchemy's first online multiplayer game is a huge success — the game already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://owlchemylabs.com/blog/dimensional-double-shift-surpasses-500000-employees-players-becomes-owlchemy-labs-fastest-growing-title-ever">surpassed 500,000 downloads</a> and is the fastest-growing Owlchemy game ever — and Hexas doubles the fun for just $5. Hard to say no to that.</p>

<p>It's quite literally impossible to find a better phone for $107. The Google Pixel 9a not only packs the latest version of Android with nearly all the best Pixel features, but it also packs the same Tensor G4 processor as all the most expensive Pixel 9 phones. In short, that means Pixel flagship-level performance for a lot less money.</p><p>Be aware, though, that the Pixel 9a doesn't include <em>all</em> the same AI features that are in the more expensive Pixel phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">because it has less RAM</a>. That Gemini XXS model is still plenty capable, for sure, and will get you access to features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screening</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-lives-video-streaming-screen-sharing-support-comes-to-pixel-9-series">Gemini Live</a>.</p><p>This year, Google has outfitted the Pixel 9a with an upgraded ultrawide lens that includes a new macro focus mode so you can take gorgeous up-close shots this Spring. We put the camera to the test in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">Pixel 9a camera review</a>, so you can get an idea of what to look forward to when your unit arrives.</p><p>Once you've secured the epic AT&T deal, take a look at the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">Pixel 9a screen protectors</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-cases">Pixel 9a cases</a> to keep your investment protected. You won't lose much money if your phone breaks, thanks to this excellent deal, but it'll be hard to replace it at this same low price if that happens.</p>

<ul><li>Motorola posted an official teaser for its Razr 2025, which gave a slight look at its design and colors.</li><li>The company's 10-second teaser also hinted at its finishes, which seemingly includes a wood option.</li><li>Motorola confirmed its Razr 2025 will arrive on April 24.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The next Motorola phone launch is shaping up to be a major one as the company teases its next "iconic" flip.</p><p>Motorola's U.S. X account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MotorolaUS/status/1910317856278855815">started teasing</a> the upcoming launch of the Razr 2025 earlier today (Apr. 10). We're coming up on the brand's typical release window for a foldable phone, and it seems we won't be disappointed. Motorola offered a short, 10-second clip of the next Razr, which features three foldables. This is curious, to say the least. Each device sports a different color, but there may be more behind Motorola showing a trio.</p><p>While the teaser doesn't give us the clearest look at the phones, it seems Motorola is sticking with dual cameras on the cover display. The cover screen is also expected to fully cover the front, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">like it has</a> over the past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">couple of generations</a>.</p><p>There's also a quick additional teaser, which glosses over the classic Motorola batwing logo. The clip shows off the red, blue, and (forest?) green colors; however, there's a wood finish, too.</p><p>Motorola delivers its latest teaser with the tagline, "When the ordinary flips to the extraordinary." The company is looking to "Make It Iconic" on April 24.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When the ordinary flips to the extraordinary. #MakeItIconic 4/24 pic.twitter.com/tJ3Mk67uaL<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1910317856278855815">April 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The end of last week held a major Motorola Razr 2025 leak, which seemingly left <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/alleged-motorola-razr-2025-series-leaks-again">nothing to the imagination</a>. The Razr 2025 and Razr Plus 2025 are expected to retain the design language the company has provided for the past few generations. That means a full 4-inch cover display and a 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display for the Plus model. The Plus is also rumored to receive Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.</p><p>Rumors add the phone could sport an "action button" on its left side and come packed with loads of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai#section-moto-ai-features">Moto AI</a>.</p><p>The latest leaks claim the base Razr 2025 could see a slightly smaller 6.7-inch display and opt for the MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chip instead of Qualcomm.</p><p>There were rumors that the next Plus iteration could grab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-charging-adapter-strength-database">68W wired fast charging</a>, but that remains to be seen as Motorola may not push the charger to this level on release. This charger could be paired with a larger 4,275mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-razr-plus-2025-leaked-specs">capacity battery</a> — or, perhaps even 4,500mAh — once it debuts.</p><p>The wood finish hinted at in Motorola's official teaser reminds us of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-wooden-finish-video-leaked">a leak from mid-March</a>. A few renders were discovered of the new phone in a wood finish, similar to what Motorola did with the Moto X. However, it's unclear if the company has opted for real wood or if it's fake, considering it seems a bit too glossy.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="what-is-the-google-pixel-9a-2">What is the Google Pixel 9a?</h2>
<p>The Pixel 9a is the latest midrange smartphone by Google. Similar to previous installments of the A series, the Pixel 9a is all about packing flagship-quality specs into a device that costs under $500. Although the phone pushes right up against that line with a $499 price tag, it still offers a load of bang for the buck in the form of great hardware, AI-powered software features, and outstanding software support. </p><p>The phone is slated to feature a lovely 6.3-inch pOLED display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, while under the hood you&apos;ll find the same Tensor G4 chipset that powers the Google Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL. </p><p>As with other Pixel phones, the cameras are really where the 9a is going to shine. Straight out of the box, you&apos;ll get all of the latest Gemini AI software features with a 48MP main camera/13MP ultrawide, 8x Super Res Zoom, and Macro Focus with 4K video support. The phone also comes with IP68 water/dust resistance, seven years of OS/security updates, and a larger battery than its popular predecessor, the Google Pixel 8a. The phone also has a distinct rear design that may or may not work for you, and it&apos;s surprisingly lighter than the base model Pixel 9. </p><p>All in all, the Pixel 9a is clearly destined to earn a spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones of 2025</a>, and I can&apos;t wait to see what kind of deals the phone will receive as we enter the summer sale season. </p>
<h2 id="should-i-buy-the-google-pixel-9-or-pixel-9a-2">Should I buy the Google Pixel 9 or Pixel 9a?</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, we put together a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9"> Google Pixel 9 vs Pixel 9a guide</a> to answer this very question! In short, it really depends on what you&apos;re willing to spend. Both devices boast great hardware, AI features, and years of software support, but you can expect the standard Pixel 9 to feature better performance, more RAM, and a nicer display. Is that enough to justify spending an additional $200 on your purchase? It&apos;s your call, but neither phone should disappoint. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google System updates usually enhance Android devices with new features, security improvements, and performance optimizations. These usually come via Play Store and Play Services, and the search giant has shared this month's release notes, giving us what to expect.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500#zippy=%2Cmarch">short changelog</a> of the release notes this week first up in the list is the system management update through Google Play services v25.13, which includes updates to system management services to improve battery life and device connectivity across Android devices, including Android Auto-enabled devices, PCs, phones, TV, and Wear OS devices.</p>

<p>Google Wallet for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> is also getting a nifty new feature where users will now be able to add nicknames for their passes in the wallet.</p><p>Google Play Store has an "Ask Play" feature that gives answers about a specific app when asked within the app page. It usually gives AI-generated responses, and with the latest v45.7 version rollout this week, answers can be seen with videos when any question is raised via the aforementioned feature.</p>
<p>The other Android System Intelligence v.23 update includes the addition of logging for Adaptive Sound and code optimization for Smart Dictation. Also, every two weeks, "Google Maps (in cars with Google built-in) provides bug fixes and improvements that help you discover new places, navigate to them, and more."</p><p>Aside from these new inclusions, improvements to Play Protect can also be expected with the latest release. Google Play Protect is also expanding its protection to more "malicious applications that try to impersonate financial apps, " the company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/google-is-using-ai-to-safeguard-play-store">announced</a> as an attempt to create a safer Android ecosystem.</p><p>Similarly, Google Play Store will also be adding verified badges starting with specific VPN apps to allow users to utilize safer VPN services, and the company intends to expand it to app categories shortly as well.</p>

<p>After a few weeks' delay, the Google Pixel 9a is finally here! We've loved the Pixel A-series for years, but this year gave us reason to worry. In addition to that "component quality issue" that caused the delay, there has been concern about performance issues, limited RAM, and the controversial new design language.</p><p>Thankfully, our reviewer, Michael Hicks, reports that Google's latest budget flagship was worth the wait. With the best battery life of any Pixel to date — yes, better than all the more expensive models — plus the same Tensor G4 processor as the more expensive Pixel 9 phones, it's hard to say no to the Pixel 9a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk-3" alt="All four Google Pixel 9a phones in each color (Iris, Peony, Porcelain, and Obsidian) placed artistically against or in front of a wooden display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before we dive into some of the phone's features, let's talk pricing. The Pixel A-series has long prided itself on delivering extreme value at a mid-range price. That means renowned Pixel camera quality, one of the fastest processors for the price, and seven years of software updates that keep it feeling fresh for a long time.</p><p>You can grab the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_9a">unlocked from Google</a> for <strong>$499 / £499 / €549 / CA$679 / Rs 49,999</strong>, which nets you 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Roughly $100 more will double your storage, which could be helpful if you're planning on keeping it the full seven years. That's 2032, to put things in full perspective!</p><p>But if you don't want to buy it straight from Google for some reason, that's no big deal. You can also find the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DVHV7X53/">unlocked at Amazon</a>, unlocked or with a carrier deal at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9a-128gb-unlocked-iris/6612951.p?skuId=6612951">Best Buy</a>, or elsewhere in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/what-color-google-pixel-9a-should-you-buy">four excellent colors</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in the U.S. and are looking for a great Google Pixel 9a deal, all the major carriers (and even some smaller carriers) are running great launch-day sales. THE MOST RIDICULOUS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/google-pixel-9a.html">deal is from AT&T</a>, which is selling the Pixel 9a for just $2.99 a month with any unlimited plan. That's on a 36-month payment plan, but that only brings the TOTAL cost to $107. Keep in mind the Pixel 9a retails for $499, and you think you've gotten the deal of a lifetime, but AT&T isn't done.</p><p>Grab a Pixel 9a today from AT&T, and they'll also toss in a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-series-review">Pixel Buds A-Series</a> for free. That gets you a pair of legit fully wireless earbuds plus Google's best A-series phone yet for roughly $500 less than you'd pay if you bought them outright. It's impossible to find a better deal than this!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PfkXdYApkKnbdyzWbzrd45" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfkXdYApkKnbdyzWbzrd45.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're not an AT&T customer or don't want to switch to AT&T for some reason, other carriers have good deals worth taking a look at, too. T-Mobile is also offering a free pair of Pixel Buds A-Series deal when you get a Pixel 9a through the Uncarrier. Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/google-phone-deals">Pixel 9a is <em>free</em></a> when you add a new line with T-Mobile, which might be even more cost-effective than AT&T's deal, depending on your plan with the company.</p><p>US Mobile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usmobile.com/pixel-promo">is offering</a> a $799 bundle deal that includes a regular Pixel 9 PLUS a Pixel 9a. You'll need to opt for an Annual Starter or Premium plan through US Mobile to get the deal, but it's pretty slick being able to get two amazing Pixel 9 phones for this price.</p><p>Lastly, Verizon is offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/google-pixel-9a/">Pixel 9a for free</a> to all new customers. Existing customers won't get the deal, which is always sad, but Verizon does offer a rather excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/is-google-one-ai-premium-the-only-mobile-ai-suite-worth-paying-for">Google One AI Premium</a> add-on for $10 a month, which includes all the amazing features of Google's $20 plan — like full access to Gemini Live and tons of cloud storage — for half the price.</p>

<p>Alright, let's talk about that big design change first. There's no shortage of controversy around Google removing the camera bar on the Pixel 9A, but Google says the change was made to prioritize function over form. The phone is thicker than the Pixel 8A and looks a lot less unique, but it comes with several advantages because of the change.</p><p>Google broke the Pixel 9A down to its base components, added a huge vapor chamber to keep the Tensor G4 extra cool, then slapped a giant battery on top. That meant adding the camera bar would have made the phone unacceptably thick, by Google's standards, so the bar had to go. Thankfully, the left-aligned camera module didn't result in a wobbly phone despite the camera bar removal, which is a big sigh of relief.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Yoq6V8p3eTw25tMuprxCU" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-4" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris using the Pixel Camera app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Yoq6V8p3eTw25tMuprxCU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google swapped out the 64MP main camera from the Pixel 8a and replaced it with a 48MP camera on the Pixel 9a. While this sounds like a downgrade on paper, the 9a actually improves quality over the 8a in some scenarios. Brady Snyder conducted a full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">Pixel 9a camera review</a> for us, which breaks down all of the differences.</p><p>Here's the TLDR version for now if you don't have to time to look at the longer article. The Pixel 9a noticeably improves color science over the Pixel 8a, delivering some of the most accurate colors from a Pixel camera in years. Daytime shots look incredible as a result, and you'll enjoy great AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a> any time of the day. Plus, the new Macro Mode turns out jaw-dropping macro shots.</p><p>In low light, there is a slight drop in sharpness and detail versus the Pixel 8a but, as Brady points out, you'd need to zoom in a lot to notice anything different. All in all, this is the Pixel camera you're looking for, and it's guaranteed to outperform anything in this price segment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Q2jkao94WkARMdadeW5mTk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-design-close-up" alt="The Google Pixel 9a sitting atop a brick chimney." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q2jkao94WkARMdadeW5mTk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Back on the design, there's sure to be a love/hate relationship with Google's changes. No, I don't mean the camera bar, mean the flattening of the overall phone. Gone are the smooth curves and ergonomic edges of the Pixel 8a's river rock design and, in their place, are very flat sides and a totally flat front and back. This makes the phone feel like a slate rather than the "friendly" design of last year's model.</p><p>But, as Google previously noted, most people won't notice the design change because it's going to be in a case. There are already some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-cases">amazing Google Pixel 9a cases</a> to grab, so if that's your plan, the wider, flatter Pixel 9a will feel just fine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVu8jzgzjBV9iosJsYV6jG" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-8" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVu8jzgzjBV9iosJsYV6jG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Pixel 9a doesn't fall into the "small" phone category with its 6.3-inch display — it matches the Pixel 9 and is larger than the 8a — Michael noted that it was easier to hold than most budget phones in its class. Some of that is thanks to weight, but a lot of it is down to the design.</p><p>Aside from making it flatter, Google also improved the Pixel 9A's water and dust resistance rating over the 8a, giving it the IP68 rating of its full-priced flagship models. Unfortunately, this one uses older Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and back, so we don't recommend going caseless unless you're ultra careful with your phones.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">good Pixel 9a screen protector</a> will keep it protected for a long time to come. Plus, unlike some other screen protectors, these won't interfere with that ultrasonic fingerprint sensor under the display.</p>

<p>When Apple launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> last month, many were left scratching their heads. Not only was the phone too expensive for what it offered, but Apple only shipped it with a single camera on the back. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9a-vs-iphone-16e-value-3542727/">Android Authority</a> points out this morning, Apple's phone looks even worse now that the Pixel 9a is out.</p><p>While both the Pixel 9a and iPhone 16e feature a similar 48MP main camera, Google's photo processing has outpaced Apple's for some time. The Pixel is better at capturing subjects in motion than an iPhone — I've named Pixel phones the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-for-parents">best phones for parents</a> for years because of this — and the more color-accurate Pixel 9a camera also helps make photos look more like real life.</p><p>And while the main camera is definitely an upgrade over the iPhone 16e, the Pixel 9a's secondary rear camera is the real star of the show here. Not only is it a super high-quality ultrawide camera but it also doubles as a macro camera that delivers some of the best macro shots you'll find on any phone. That's not something your ordinary $500 phone can claim, and definitely <em>not</em> something the $600 iPhone 16e can do at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="khCCKwW4prHRa4bjhU3Re3" name="Pixel9a-vs-8a-vs-7a-5" alt="The Pixel 9a in Iris beside the Pixel 8a in Aloe and Pixel 7a in Bay." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khCCKwW4prHRa4bjhU3Re3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you need any one reason to choose a Pixel 9a over other Pixel phones, it's the battery life. Google Tensor processors have never been very efficient and that has resulted in poor battery life, but big thermal changes and an even bigger battery make the Pixel 9a <strong>the</strong> Pixel phone to get for battery life.</p><p>Android Central's Michael Hicks and Brady Snyder both said they were able to get around 2 days of use out of a single charge, something that's absolutely <em>never</em> been true of any Pixel phone to date. Most Pixel A-series phones struggled to last just one day, much less into the second at all.</p><p>That's all while packing the exact same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> processor as all the more expensive Pixel 9 series phones. Yes, that even includes the $1700 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p>

Abner Li says, "Google has created my new favorite phone design," citing the almost-flat, camera-bar-less design as the reason.</p><p>This design change, coupled with the matte glass back and the flat side rails, makes it much nicer to hold than the mainline Pixel 9 series, according to Abner. "The Pixel 9a feels like you’re just holding a screen" might just be my favorite quote from the review, as it's easily the most positive thing I've heard from anyone regarding the Pixel 9a's incredibly flat and sterile design.</p><p>What might be more interesting is Abner's love for the uniformity of the design. "It results in such a clean form however you’re handling, like when fishing out of your pocket or bag, or gripping." Despite that uniformity, the matte glass on the back feels different enough from the shiny glass on the front that "you won’t mistake the two materials." Plus, matte glass isn't a fingerprint magnet like the shiny glass on other Pixel 9's.</p><p>I far prefer the rounder design of the Pixel 8a and love the camera bar on older Pixel phones, but it's clear that some people simply like different things. Will that be you? Let us know!</p>

<p>Great performance isn't common in a $500 phone these days, but Google has bucked that trend since the Google Pixel 6a with its Tensor G1 processor. Now that we're on Tensor G4, Google has worked out the thermal issues and ensured that this is still class-leading performance in most cases. At the least, the Tensor G4 is a much better fit for the $500 Pixel 9a than it is in the $999 Pixel 9 Pro, as Michael Hicks pointed out in our review.</p><p>But don't just take our word for it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9a-review-basic-in-just-the-right-way-130050005.html">Engadget's review</a> echoes the same sentiments, citing multicore performance on par with the more expensive Pixel 9 series. The only lament made is the reduced amount of RAM, which means power users will likely be less happy with the Pixel 9a than the mainline series, which features 4GB of RAM more than the 9a.</p><p>There's also a possibility that some AI features in the future might not make it to the Pixel 9a, as we've seen older phones skip newer AI features due to lack of RAM. Ironically, Google's lowest-spec phone features as much RAM as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">most expensive iPhone</a> so, at the very least, we don't expect to see the Pixel 9a fall behind iPhones in terms of great software features.</p>

<p>Another great reason to choose the Pixel 9a is longevity. The Pixel 9a gets seven years of OS updates and security patches, "leaving behind most mid-range phones with two or three OS versions at most" as Michael puts it in our review.</p><p>Most of the time, lower-cost phones aren't worth holding on to for a long time because they ship with lower-performance processors that simply don't do well after a few years. The processor in the Pixel 9a is not only fast enough to last for several years, but Google guarantees updates through 2032. That's simply not the norm on other phones.</p>

<p>Howdy all, I'm the guy who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">reviewed the Pixel 9a</a> (Michael Hicks) and I'm taking over this live blog for the next few hours! Do you have questions for Brady and I about the 9a? You can email michael.hicks@futurenet.com with your questions or concerns and assuming the spam filter doesn't eat them, I'm happy to answer them here.</p><p>For starters, let's talk software. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-9a-missing-android-15-feature-drop-at-launch/">Android Police</a> covered the fact that the Pixel 9a is missing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March Pixel Drop features</a> like Modes, and that you'll probably have to wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> for a major 9a update.</p><p>On the one hand, I'll point out that the Pixel 9 series launched with Android <em>14</em>, so a missing feature drop doesn't feel that bad to me. On the other hand, the Pixel 9a is <em>never</em> going to get some Gemini Nano features like Pixel Screenshots because of its 8GB of RAM. So if you're someone who closely follows every Pixel Drop and tests every new AI feature, the Pixel 9a might not be the right fit for you!</p>

<p>Looking over other sites' Pixel 9a reviews, the harshest comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Techradar</a>, which gave it a 3/5, said it's "so dang ugly" compared to other Pixels, and claimed that despite the larger battery, it doesn't actually last longer than the Pixel 9 or 9 Pro.</p><p>I guess to decide that the 9a battery was no big deal, they did a rundown test and found that both the 9a and 9 both lasted about 13 hours while streaming content. But that's not really indicative of real-world use, and in that case, I found that it really does last about a day and a half with active use, while past Pixels were much more likely to require a daily top-off. Other reviews I've read agree that the battery boost is real.</p><p>As for the phone being "ugly as sin," I mean, <strong>every</strong> phone these days is a "flat slab of plastic broken by a round camera bump." I certainly agreed in my review that this design is pretty boring, and that I miss my Pixel 9's camera bar. But out of the reasons not to buy a Pixel 9a, I'd argue that ugliness isn't really one of them. It just looks like any other Android phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wEWwJ6NYwrrgQcJTyvhFLk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Pixel-Studio" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in hand, showing the Pixel Studio app creating a logo from a text prompt." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wEWwJ6NYwrrgQcJTyvhFLk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's talk more about AI. As I said in my review, if your experience with AI is using Gemini Live, Pixel Studio, or any other app that relies on <em>cloud</em>-based processing, then using the Pixel 9a is no different from a Pixel 9 or 9 Pro. I ran queries on multiple Pixels at once, and the 9a took the same amount of time.</p><p>The bigger issue is that the Pixel 9a uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">"Gemini Nano XXS"</a> because of its 8GB of RAM, limiting features like Pixel Screenshots that require on-device AI. Even though it has the same Tensor G4 and powerful NPU as its siblings, the Pixel 9a just isn't able to think for itself — or maybe just not well enough for Google to unlock the feature for consumers.</p><p>In the long run, a Pixel 9 Pro with 16GB of RAM will probably be able to handle future on-device AI tricks years down the line, but a Pixel 9a, 10a, and so on may be permanently shut out. For AI fans, that may be a bigger deal than missing out on a telephoto lens or other Pro perks.</p>

<p>Is the Google Pixel 9a the best mid-range phone of the year? If you let your budget creep up to $599, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is a tough challenger because of its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, 12GB/256GB memory, LTPO display, <em>much</em>-faster charging at 80W, and 50MP telephoto lens with 2X optical zoom.</p><p>I'd personally choose the Pixel 9a, simply because it's about an ounce lighter and I'd prioritize compact comfort and a lower price. It also gets three more years of OS updates, though I don't know how many people use A-series phones for more than four years anyway.</p><p>Otherwise, most of the other phones in this price range like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A56</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing 3a Pro</a>, or Motorola Edge can't match the Pixel 9a for specs or AI insights.</p>

<p>AC's parent company has a testing suite (Future Labs) that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Tom's Guide</a> used for more concrete Pixel 9a display quality testing than my typical eyeball tests in its review.</p><p>They found that the Pixel 9a hit 2,076 peak brightness, about double what the iPhone 16e offers and nearly double the OnePlus 13R and Nothing 3a Pro. Most importantly, it easily beat the Pixel 8a (1,378 nits), though it lost to the Pixel 9 (2,390).</p><p>The 9a also hit an impressive 94.2% DCI-P3, though Tom's Guide found it "doesn’t quite reach the same "iridescence" or color accuracy as the Pixel 9.</p><p>In my testing, I couldn't really tell the Pixel 9 and 9a displays apart that clearly, but I <em>could</em> tell that the 9a display was exceptionally bright for a phone in this price range, and this objectively proves it. If you're like me, and like to take your phone on runs in sunny weather, the 9a is a great fit.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9a camera may be downgraded compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, but when I looked at my 9a camera samples (I threw a few of them above), the colors are genuinely accurate to real life, without the overprocessing I expected.</p><p>People will be excited that the Pixel 9a added Add Me for AI trickery, but I'm a bigger fan of Macro Focus. Get a couple of inches away from a subject, and the viewfinder will show a little green flower symbol and automatically switch to this mode, determining the subject and putting that in focus while the rest blurs out. It's a nice upgrade for Pixel 8a users who upgrade.</p><p>The Pixel 9a has its downsides — the lack of optical zoom and struggles with low light, and a general lack of detail compared to more expensive phones — but this is still a Pixel phone, which means you can expect a certain level of quality.</p>

<p>A couple of Pixel 9a reviews and posts — including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-pixel-9a-review-a-value-packed-phone-just-at-the-right-time/">CNET</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-9a/">Wired</a>, and The Verge — have referenced the recent threats of tariffs, saying that the $499 Pixel 9a is coming at "the right time" and hoping that price doesn't change. Google told CNET that "there are no changes to the pricing and availability of the Pixel 9A" related to tariffs, at least for now.</p><p>Without diving into the complicated politics and worsening trade fight between the U.S. and China, it's fair to say that the Pixel 9a should remain at $499 in the short term, but that most tech brands will pass off tariff costs to the consumer if things <em>do</em> escalate.</p><p>So aside from the fact that carriers and the Google Store are offering good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9a-deals-of-the-month">Pixel 9a pre-order deals</a>, you may want to buy a 9a now, simply to lock in that affordable price.</p>

<p>Ready to chuckle at Google? Here's the "replacement Pixel 9a" that Google just sent to Brady.</p><p>Some background: He's been testing the Pixel 9a as well, and he's had issues with the under-display fingerprint sensor refusing to acknowledge his biometrics, even after rescanning them. Google said it must be a defective unit and promised to send him a new Pixel 9a. Instead, he got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, which was definitely a shipping error but <em>feels</em> like Google is trying to subtly tell us something 😂.</p><p>In all seriousness, I haven't had any issues with the fingerprint sensor, and glancing over a dozen other Pixel 9a reviews, no one else has mentioned it. So it's entirely possible that it <em>is</em> a rare hardware error rather than anything to worry about. But if you end up having problems, send it back to Google and you might get an accidental $600 upgrade.</p>

<p>Let's talk <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/what-color-google-pixel-9a-should-you-buy">Pixel 9a colors</a>. Google sent me the Porcelain Pixel 9a, and hoo boy is it the worst of the four. Obsidian (black) is inoffensive and makes the camera sensor blend in more seamlessly, while this off-white Porcelain model only makes the 9a's slab look more apparent.</p><p>Google sent Brady the Iris model, which I think must indicate that they like him better than me. If I were to buy a 9a, I'd choose Iris because the soft blue gives it a bit of personality without being quite as gaudy as Peony — which is kind of fun but trends a bit too close to cotton candy coloring for my personal tastes.</p>

<p>One of the big questions with the Pixel 9a was with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-past-gen-exynos-modem-confirmation">last-gen Exynos modem</a>, which is slightly older than the 5400 found in the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>The challenge with "reviewing" a modem is that it's highly situational. My Bay Area coverage is fairly comprehensive so that the Pixel 9a rarely struggled with cellular connectivity or excess battery drain throughout my testing period; nor did Brady experience any issues yet. But if you've had problems with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, it's fair to assume that the 9a will have similar issues.</p><p>You also get Wi-Fi 6E support; I find that more than sufficient but people with Wi-Fi 7 routers will disagree.</p>

<p>Hey all, it's Brady Snyder taking over, and I've spent the better part of two weeks testing my Google Pixel 9a review unit in comparison to its biggest competitors — including the Pixel 9, Pixel 8a, Pixel 7a, and Nothing Phone 3a Pro. To start, I want to talk about how the Pixel 9a shakes up against the Pixel 9, which only costs slightly more after deals and promotions.</p><p>You're going to hear a lot about how the Pixel 9a has 8GB of RAM, which is four gigabytes fewer than the Google Pixel 9. That means it should perform worse than the Pixel 9, right? Wrong. I was stunned that the Pixel 9a consistently performs better than the Pixel 9 in synthetic benchmark tests, like Geekbench 6.</p>

<p>That means if you don't care about new AI features — like Pixel Screenshots and Call Notes, which are missing — the Pixel 9a is a more than capable daily driver.</p><p>You can check out my full breakdown of how these two phones compare <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/i-spent-weeks-with-the-google-pixel-9a-and-the-pixel-9-you-should-buy-this-one">here</a>.</p>

<p>Google did something great with this year's Pixel 9a — it is offering storage upgrades in more colors for the first time. On paper, you'll see that the Google Pixel starts at $499 for 128GB of storage, and can be upgraded to 256GB of storage for an extra $100. They're the same storage configurations as last year.</p><p>What's different? This year, you aren't stuck buying the Obsidian (Black) colorway if you want extra storage space. With both the Pixel 7a and Pixel 8a, the 256GB storage option was only available for the Obsidian color, limiting your options. Now, you can get the Pixel 9a in 256GB in either the Iris or Obsidian colorways.</p><p>The Porcelain and Peony colors are still only available as 128GB models, but this slight expansion is a good start for Google's A-series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VPAaa9HeDidGkJhtGSoLtf" name="Pixel-9a-Gemini-Live" alt="The Gemini Live video streaming on the Pixel 9a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VPAaa9HeDidGkJhtGSoLtf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a's memory limitations mean that it can only run Gemini Nano XXS, a smaller and less powerful AI model than the rest of the Pixel 9 series. The good news is that these shortcomings won't affect the Pixel 9a's off-device AI capabilities, like with Gemini Live. The Pixel 9a gets the same Gemini Live with video streaming and screen sharing experience as all the other Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 series phones, which is impressive at the $499 price point.</p>

<p>More importantly, Gemini Live with video streaming and screen sharing is completely free on the Pixel 9a. Phones from other brands, including older Pixel and Galaxy models, won't get the features free-of-charge. They'll need to pay $20 per month for the Google One AI Premium plan. The Pixel 9a's inclusion of all the latest Gemini Live features is yet another reason why it pays to opt for Google's midranger over the competition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yryPdtTP8jE4d6K7ZBuygX" name="Pixel9a-vs-8a-vs-7a-3" alt="The Pixel 9a in Iris beside the Pixel 8a in Aloe and Pixel 7a in Bay." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yryPdtTP8jE4d6K7ZBuygX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plenty of testers, including those at Android Central, have praised the Pixel 9a's new pOLED screen on the Google Pixel 9a, and for good reason. It's the brightest A-series phone ever, topping out at 2,700 nits of peak brightness. If that wasn't enough, it also happens to sport the exact same resolution as the regular Pixel 9. The bezels are bigger on the Pixel 9a, but that fades away pretty quickly when you start using the device.</p><p>However, the bigger deal might be that the Pixel 9a now has a 6.3-inch screen for the first time. The Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a both had 6.1-inch displays, which made them a smaller and more compact offering. Now, the Pixel 9a and the Pixel 9 have the same exact screen size, further reducing the differences between models. Do you think Google should've stuck with a more compact form factor for the A-series?</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9a's controversial design has been well-chronicled, and I can't decide whether I love it or hate it. One thing's for sure — if Google wanted to go for a flat back, it should've made the Pixel 9a <em>completely</em> flat. Instead, the company split the middle, creating a phone that's nearly flat with a slight protrusion for the cameras coming out of the polycarbonate plastic back.</p><p>This causes a few real-world issues. I've noticed that the tiny crack between the glass camera covering and the plastic trim quickly becomes a dust magnet, capturing all the lint in your pocket. Additionally, the Pixel 9a's rear camera covering seems more prone to getting covered in dust or scratches due to the design. For reference, while the Pixel 9's camera bar protrudes from the phone's back glass, the camera glass is actually slightly recessed in that aluminum bar.</p><p>It's something to consider before buying a Pixel 9a, but I don't think it should be a dealbreaker.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tRfhAHdHKDbXuLaznYzpmP" name="Pixel-9a-Overheating" alt="The Google Pixel 9a overheating." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tRfhAHdHKDbXuLaznYzpmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overheating has been an all-too-common problem on past Google Pixel phones, but what about on the new Pixel 9a? Like the other Tensor G4-powered phones, the Pixel 9a usually operates fine even in tough conditions. However, that's not to say it won't ever overheat. I happen to live in Phoenix, Arizona, which is an absolutely grueling climate for anything with a battery.</p><p>Today, it's 97-degrees Fahrenheit, and I made the mistake of leaving my Pixel 9a in direct sunlight for about 10 to 15 minutes. The screen was off, but the phone ended up shutting down completely and restarting after that span. To be fair, my M2 MacBook Air crashed less than a minute afterward, so this isn't a Pixel 9a problem. It is something to keep in mind if you live in an unusually-hot climate, though.</p>

<p>After thoroughly testing the Google Pixel 9a, the impressive new feature that stands out to me is Macro Focus. To be clear, the feature isn't new, appearing on the rest of the Pixel 9 series and even Pixel phones older than that. However, the Pixel 9a represents the first time an A-series phone gets to use Macro Focus.</p><p>Google now uses the main, 48MP camera for Macro Focus on the Pixel 9a. Previously, the Pixel 8a used the 13MP ultrawide lens to create pseudo-macro shots that didn't turn out that amazing. Meanwhile, the experience with Macro Focus on the Pixel 9a couldn't be more different. It's not a gimmick — it really provides a stunning level of detail, down to the hairs on a tomato plant.</p>

<p>Hours deep into Google Pixel 9a launch day, there still are plenty of ways to get your hands on a new phone quickly. In fact, the Pixel 9a is available for in-store pickup at select Google Store locations today, including at Google's NYC Williamsburg and Chelsea stores. Depending on your location, you could be looking at delivery dates for all Pixel 9a colors around April 16 or April 17 — about a week away.</p><p>Google Store is also offering a limited-time promotion that'll net you $100 store credit toward your next purchase when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_9a" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">buy an unlocked Pixel 9a</a>.</p>

The Pixel 9a has kept up the A-series legacy as a solid value flagship. I did notice compromises in terms of camera quality and long-term AI viability, but they're reasonable cutbacks that only power users won't accept.</p><p>And the revamped Pixel 9a battery life is good enough to even make Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro owners jealous.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a has the same machine-cut, flat-sided aesthetic as most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and iPhones these days. Its only claim to fame is the ultra-slim, teardrop camera sensor that's a bit <em>too</em> subtle, squeezed into the corner of a flat, matte slab.</p><p>The classic Pixel camera housing catches on pockets but keeps your phone steady on flat surfaces. I was worried the left-aligned 9a sensor would bring back the imbalanced wobble so common with other brands, but it doesn't! It's easy to browse and tap the 9a on a desk or wireless charger, and it's much simpler to slide it into my jeans pocket.</p>

<p>Google justified <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">removing its trademark camera bar</a> by explaining it was necessary to "eliminate battery anxiety" with more capacity and make the 9a vapor chamber larger for better thermals.</p><p>This naturally made the 9a thicker, so they had to slim down the display and camera sensors to keep it at the same 8.9mm thickness as the Pixel 8a. Frankly, that's <em>not</em> very slim, and the 8a has softer edges to ease the grip a bit.</p>

<p>Removing the camera bar was the right decision: Battery life is the trademark feature the 9a needed, the cooling chamber seems to be effective, and it offsets the extra weight. The trade-off is that the thicker 9a widens your grip a bit, which takes a little getting used to.</p><p>Still, it's lighter and easier to hold than most 6.7-inch budget phones; the 9a isn't a "small phone," but it falls into a decent sweet spot.</p><p>I also appreciate that the Pixel 9a has IP68 dust and water resistance, a slight bump in the usual IP67 standard. Unfortunately, Google stuck with Gorilla Glass 3 for protection, saving Victus 2 for the mainline Pixel 9s. I don't have any scratches yet, but it's only a matter of time without a screen protector.</p><p>Caseless daredevils will enjoy the Pixel 9a's matte finish that doesn't show fingerprints (at least on my Porcelain model). I also appreciated that the volume rocker and power button have a more subtle <em>click</em> than the Pixel 8a when pressed.</p>

<p>Google essentially transplanted the Pixel 9 display onto the Pixel 9a. You get the same 6.3-inch size, FHD resolution, non-LTPO 120Hz refresh rate, and up to 2,700 nits of brightness outdoors or 1,800 nits with HDR.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, no phone hits its peak brightness score outside of cherry-picked pixels and settings trickery.

<p>Despite the 9a's tradeoffs in other areas, it's visually uncompromised from the Pixel 9 — except for its lesser Gorilla Glass protection, slightly thicker bezels, and 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.

<p>The classic A-series appeal is getting a "flagship" chip in a mid-range phone. Tensor chips have fallen behind the top Snapdragon and Dimensity chips for raw power — though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">TSMC-made G5 may change that</a> — but the Tensor G4 feels like a much better fit for a $499 phone than a $999 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>.</p>

<p>Past A-series phones showed subtle Tensor downgrades or thermal issues in post-launch teardowns, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The redesign to squeeze in proper vapor cooling paid off in the benchmarks: the Pixel 9a is the slowest of the three phones, but not by a significant margin, and its graphical performance is right in the mix despite having 4–8GB less RAM.</p><p>This year's Snapdragon flagships may crush the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, but when it comes to mid-range phones, the Tensor G4 easily destroys the competition for browsing, gaming, and AI.</p><p>My colleagues resented that the Pixel 9 & 9 Pro default to 128GB UFS 3.1 storage, with no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS 4.0</a> option for faster data transfer and game loading. That's a fair complaint for flagships, but this storage level is a reasonable default for mid-tier phones.</p><p>Otherwise, the hardware perks I've liked on other Pixels apply here, particularly the subtle but strong haptics and fairly rich stereo sound whenever I'm not using wireless earbuds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kNnzDF9vqkG5X65LDkvq23" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-6" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in the hand showing the Android Central homepage." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNnzDF9vqkG5X65LDkvq23.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of specific 9a downgrades, the 8GB of memory has little noticeable impact on day-to-day browsing or Android gaming, aside from some occasional lag while editing photos. However, it <em>does</em> restrict a few Gemini Nano-powered features that require <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a>, which I'll address in the software section.</p><p>You also get Wi-Fi 6e, though the 9a adds more antennas with 2x2 MIMO. Whether I used wireless or cellular over the Exynos modem, I didn't notice any connectivity issues, dropped calls, or slow downloads over Google Fi. Your mileage may vary based on your network and region; if you're at all concerned, snag a Pixel 9 for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> and a newer modem.</p><p>As a final point, my colleague Brady Snyder has had issues with the 9a under-display fingerprint sensor, even after rescanning his prints. I haven't had a single failed reading all week, but I've included his grievance since it's a familiar refrain for the last few generations of Pixel fingerprint sensors.</p>

<p>Battery life is the star of the Pixel 9a show. Google estimates 30+ hours, a 6-hour boost over the 8a. We called last year's A-series "disappointing" for battery life, while the Pixel 9a <em>easily</em> lasts a day with heavy gaming, streaming, camera, and AI use, with juice to spare.</p><p>Both Brady and I found that we could stretch the 9a to two days with more casual use and decent standby battery life. Your mileage will vary if you toggle the Smooth Display option, but unlike with the 8a, it won't wreck your battery life if you <em>do</em> turn it on.</p><p>Many other budget phones have 5,000mAh+ capacity but much larger displays and less efficient chipsets than the Tensor G4. I wonder if people who buy phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review" target="_blank">Moto G Power 2025</a> will like the 9a's compact endurance or if they'll find it too expensive.</p><p>The Pixel 9a's longevity mitigates its problem with slow 23W charging. Because it'll easily last a full day and night with capacity to spare, it might not matter that it takes about 20 minutes to hit 25%, 46 minutes to 50%, or 105 minutes to hit 100% with a 30W charger. Pixel 9 charging is barely any faster, so you're not missing out on anything.</p><p>I rarely use wireless charging, but let's be frank: at 7.5W, it's only suited for overnight charging where speed doesn't matter. Otherwise, it's so slow as to be almost pointless.</p>

<p>Google kept the Pixel 9a ultrawide and selfie cameras unchanged, and its new 48MP main sensor is smaller than the 64MP sensor on the Pixel 8a — though it has a larger aperture.

<p>His results mirrored my own. I found that the Pixel 9a captures vivid colors where other phones (like the 8a) tend to oversaturate, but that you need bright conditions and to get close to your subject to capture enough detail.</p>

<p>I especially enjoyed the Macro Focus shots, as shown above. It usually does a good job of recognizing what should remain in focus or be blurred out, and the viewfinder will automatically switch to this mode when you get close enough to your subject, making it easy to use.</p><p>Generally speaking, the Pixel 9a outperforms almost any mid-range phone for camera quality, even if you can see its obvious shortcomings compared to a Pixel 9 Pro with better optical zoom, a larger sensor that captures more light, and more pro settings.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a claims the top spot on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> list. One cheaper alternative is the Samsung Galaxy A56, which has a dimmer 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED with better Victus+ protection. It gets six years of OS updates, and its 5,000mAh battery is paired with faster 45W charging. But its Exynos 1580 chip isn't as powerful as the Tensor G4.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R costs $100 more for a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip with more raw power paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB UFS 4.0 storage, plus a 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED, 6,000mAh battery with 80W charging, and a 50MP telephoto lens. This is a true value flagship, but again, it's a bit expensive, quite heavy, and only gets four years of OS updates.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a Pro</a> is another alternative. At $459, you get 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, dual 50MP sensors with a 3X periscope lens for good camera quality, a 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED display, and six years of support. But you also get a slower Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip, Wi-Fi 6, a heavy design with a bulky camera island, and IP64 water resistance.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Google Pixel 9a if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best possible battery life paired with Pixel smarts.</li><li>You see Gemini AI as an exciting novelty (but maybe not a daily necessity).</li><li>Google's trademark software support and camera processing appeal to you.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy the Google Pixel 9a if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You care about Wi-Fi 7, Gemini Nano, or telephoto lenses.</li><li>You want a larger display or blazing charging speeds (especially wireless).</li><li>You want the best possible benchmarks or pro camera tools.</li></ul>
<p>I don't know what Google fixed with its component quality delay, but it seems to have worked.</p><p>I'll continue to test the Google Pixel 9a over the next couple of months to see if I missed any obvious pain points, but so far, I haven't had any issues, and Brady's only complaint with his 9a loaner is with the fingerprint sensor and low-light photography.</p><p>It's easy to take the A-Series for granted, but it's pretty darn rare to get a $499 phone with a "flagship" chip and excellent AI-backed photography. Now that we get epic battery life too, the Pixel 9a is tough competition for any mid-range phone. I still kinda miss the camera bar, but I can live with that.</p>

Google ditched the 64MP primary sensor on the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a for a 48MP wide camera on the Pixel 9a. By now, you might be wondering why Google went with a smaller primary camera sensor with fewer megapixels and how it performs compared to previous-generation Pixels.</p><p>As it turns out, Google switched to a different main camera in part to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">the Pixel 9's almost-flush camera system</a> possible. "Pixel 9a has an all-new rear main camera that enables the new industrial design and new Macro Focus," the company told Android Central.</p><p>After two weeks of testing the Pixel 9a, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, and Pixel 7a side-by-side, I can confidently say that the latest camera hardware isn't a noticeable downgrade from the older models. You might notice a slight dip in detail in certain situations, specifically in unfavorable lighting conditions. But you'd need to zoom in to notice, and it's a minuscule drop compared to all the other Pixel 9a camera improvements.</p><p>Notably, the Google Pixel 9a appears to reverse a recent trend with Pixel cameras that oversaturated colors at the expense of accuracy. The Pixel 9a is the most color-accurate Google phone I've tested in at least a few generations, and that should be the main takeaway here. Let's dive in and explore how the Pixel 9a, Pixel 8a, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> fare in head-to-head rear camera tests.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9a-vs-8a-vs-7a-main-camera"><span>Google Pixel 9a vs. 8a vs. 7a: Main camera</span></h2>
<p>First, let's start out with some specs. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> is equipped with a 48MP, f/1.7 primary camera with a 1/2-inch image sensor size. By comparison, both the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a have a 64MP, f/1.89 primary camera with a 1/1.73-inch image sensor size. The change in megapixel count shouldn't concern you at all (the Pixel 9 has a 50MP camera, for reference), but the smaller image sensor size on the Pixel 9a was initially concerning.</p><p>Image sensor size directly correlates to image quality because bigger sensors can take in more light and color information, leading to more detailed shots. However, it isn't the only thing that leads to great smartphone photos — other things like computational photography, color science, and image processing also play a huge role.</p><p>In the image gallery of camera sample comparisons below, you'll see that there isn't a noticeable drop-off in detail between the Pixel 9a, Pixel 8a, and Pixel 7a in daylight.</p>

<p>In terms of detail and quality, the Pixel 9a matches or beats the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a in every test. What really caught my eye was the differences in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-hdr">HDR and color science</a> in photos captured with the Pixel 9a. Whether it's related to the camera sensor itself, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">upgraded Tensor G4 chip</a>, or software, it leads to photos that more accurately represent the landscape you're trying to capture.</p><p>I live in the Arizona desert, an environment that Google Pixel cameras of all price points have struggled to capture accurately. Google's preference for vibrant and colorful photos has often oversaturated these kinds of shots. For instance, in some examples above captured with the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a, the sky is too deep of a blue, or the sand is too deep of an orange.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 9a accurately depicts the sand in the photos above as a tan color rather than a clay color. The sky and water are often less vibrant when captured with the Pixel 9a as opposed to older models, but that's for the best. It is the more accurate representation of the environment and could mark a breakthrough for Google.</p><p>I came away incredibly pleased with the fresh take on color science with the Pixel 9a. It's improved not only compared to the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a but also compared to the regular Pixel 9.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9a-vs-8a-vs-7a-ultrawide-macro-photography"><span>Google Pixel 9a vs. 8a vs. 7a: Ultrawide & macro photography</span></h2>
<p>The Pixel 9a's main camera shares specifications with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold's main camera</a>, which could mean it's the exact same sensor. Regardless, this leads to the Pixel 9a getting the same Macro Focus feature as the Pixel 9 series (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">first added to the Pixel 7 Pro</a>). It intelligently tries to identify and isolate objects that are close to the camera lens, around five centimeters away, using a mix of hardware and software.</p><p>Google has a handful of excellent camera features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>, but Macro Focus on the Pixel 9a might be my favorite one yet, and that's a high compliment. The feature isn't perfect—it occasionally blurs a small part of the intended object or not enough of the background. That being said, Macro Focus produces the best macro shots on a phone without a dedicated macro lens.</p>

<p>As you can see in the photos above, the Pixel 9a does a better job at blurring the background than both the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a. It also provides much more detail than older A-series Pixel phones. My favorite Macro Focus shot captured the individual hairs (technically called trichomes) on a tomato plant, as you can see below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="p4iNBBs7tCcLEMDLvNzt6M" name="Pixel-9a-camera-samples-misc-3" alt="A photo captured with the Google Pixel 9a's main camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p4iNBBs7tCcLEMDLvNzt6M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ultrawide camera on the Pixel 9a is the exact same one featured on both the Pixel 8a and the Pixel 7a. It's a 13MP ultrawide lens with an f/2.2 aperture and a 120-degree field of view. Naturally, the Pixel 9a, Pixel 8a, and Pixel 7a produce ultrawide shots with similar levels of detail.</p><p>Once again, the Pixel 9a's improved color science creates a photo that's drastically more accurate than the Pixel 8a despite using the same hardware.</p>

<p>With the primary and ultrawide lenses, you can take photos at optical quality at both 0.5x and 1x zoom. Any further zoom than that will be using digital zoom, with Super Res Zoom available at up to 8x. By contrast, the Pixel 9, which also has two lenses, is able to capture optical quality images at 2x zoom.</p><p>Although its omission is understandable, given the Pixel 9a's price point, it's hard to live without optical-quality zoom at higher levels.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9a-vs-8a-vs-7a-low-light-capture"><span>Google Pixel 9a vs. 8a vs. 7a: Low-light capture</span></h2>
<p>It's relatively unsurprising that the Pixel 9a turns in good photos with favorable lighting conditions, but how does it fare when the sun starts to set? This is the area where the Pixel 9a's smaller sensor might start to hurt it compared to the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a. The results do confirm that the Pixel 9a has ever-so-slightly less detail in night shots than the prior two generations, but not enough to be meaningful.</p>

<p>Specifically, you start to notice the small dip in detail when looking at something far off in a photo. In the first example photo, you can see the yellow pedestrian crossing sign looks a bit more blurry than the equivalent shots captured by the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a.</p><p>A similar situation occurs with the barbecue restaurant's lighted sign in the fifth photo. These signs aren't as crisp and clear when captured by the Pixel 9a, but you have to zoom in to notice.</p><p>Night shots were the most hit-or-miss aspect of the Pixel 9a camera system, with some photos turning out perfect and others looking grainy or over-smoothened in processing. Still, you can say that of almost every budget phone's camera system, so this isn't a huge knock on the Pixel 9a.</p><p>If all you care about is raw detail, I could see the argument for preferring the Pixel 8a's main camera sensor. Personally, I think the Pixel 9a's improved color science and Macro Focus mode more than make up for any tiny loss in clarity you might notice.</p>

<p>I was very skeptical of the Google Pixel 9a's camera performance, as the lower megapixel count and smaller sensor size could've led to a drastic drop in detail compared to previous A-series Pixels. However, that didn't turn out to be the case. I've criticized recent Google Pixel cameras for being too vibrant and inaccurate in terms of color science in the past, so it's a big deal to me that this is improved with the Pixel 9a.</p><p>As you can see in the final gallery below, the Pixel 9a can take great shots in a number of situations, performing better the more light there is available.</p>

<p>So, if you're in the market for a Pixel 9a and get spooked by the seemingly-worse camera system, there isn't any reason to panic. The Google Pixel 9a produces photos that are better holistically than both the Pixel 8a and the Pixel 7a. Due to the Pixel 8a's extremely poor color accuracy, the Pixel 9a's camera will be a noticeable improvement year-over-year.</p>

<hr>
<p>MediaTek announces a brand new SoC designed to "raise the bar" of flagship smartphone performance.</p><p>In a press release, the Taiwanese OEM states the new 3nm process Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC takes what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">the original 9400</a> did and builds upon it. To begin, the company explains its core structure, which features a Big Core design. With one Arm Cortex-X925 core at 3.73GHz, 3x Cortex-X4 cores, and 4x Cortex-A720 cores, MediaTek claims this chip will propel Android UX experiences.</p><p>The Dimensity 9400 Plus chip features integration with the 12-core Arm Immortalis-G925 GPU. MediaTek states this GPU enables "PC-level features to smartphones with opacity micromap support for realistic effects." In short, the Dimensity 9400 Plus should help bring a more lifelike experience to vegetation, character hair, and animal feathers. These upgrades bring a 40% power efficiency boost to MediaTek's latest chip.</p><p>Additionally, this GPU is said to "double" the effective FPS for phones and boost the chip's power efficiency by 50% for game developers. MediaTek appears confident that this GPU will help reduce gaming lag for users who are playing over longer periods.</p>

<p>As you might expect, MediaTek isn't holding back with its AI advancements with the Dimensity 9400 Plus. The post states the latest upgraded chip brings "exceptional edge-AI performance." Thanks to the NPU 890, the 9400 Plus supports the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek R1</a> LLM for on-device assistance. MediaTek states its chip is "the first" to incorporate support for R1's four technologies: Mixture of-Experts, Multi-Head Latent Attention, Multi-Token Prediction, and FP8.</p><p>Incorporating these is said to boost the AI's "reasoning speeds." The OEM also worked to improve the chip's generative AI models by 20% over the O.G. 9400.</p><p>In a statement, a MediaTek member said, "The MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ will allow developers to deliver innovative, personalized AI experiences on-device, offering a number of speed and privacy benefits." The chip's built-in Dimensity Agentic AI Engine gives developers an entry point into "sophisticated" agentic AI apps.</p>

<p>There's more to the Dimensity 9400 Plus, such as its focus on enhancing the video recording experience for future users. MediaTek says its chip features Imagiq 1090 for HDR video recording "across the entire zoom range." The company pairs this with its Smooth Zoom technology for "seamless capture" of moving subjects.</p><p>Extra specs include the chip's inclusion of BeiDou satellite connection, which is 60% faster for users looking to utilize its capabilities with your cell signal drops. Phone-to-phone direct Bluetooth connections expand to 8km, which is roughly four times greater than the Dimensity 9400. Consumers will also be able to take advantage of 5G/4G dual-SIM and even greater Wi-Fi coverage.</p><p>MediaTek says its Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC will be available by Q2 2025 for the next wave of smartphones.</p>

<ul><li>Xiaomi announces its Android 16 Developer Preview Program for those creating apps for its upcoming upgrade.</li><li>The preview will provide developers with the tools needed to develop their apps to sort of issues, but it's only accepting the Xiaomi 15 and 14T Pro models.</li><li>Google recently achieved "Platform Stability" with Android 16, meaning its on track to deliver the next major OS in Q2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Xiaomi is in the early stages of Android 16 development, and those creating apps can get a head start, too.</p><p>The Chinese OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/global/support/guidance/androidtbeta">announced</a> the start of its Android 16 Developer Preview Program for early app development (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://locationtrackinghub.com/global-android-16-based-hyperos-2-beta/">Location Tracking Hub</a>). Similar to Google, Xiaomi is encouraging interested developers to take part in its preview program, which provides all the tools they will need to "improve the compatibility" and develop their Android 16-supported apps. Interested parties are restricted to a pair of phones to start.</p><p>Xiaomi states its developer preview is accepting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">the 14T Pro</a>.</p><p>The announcement post states developers can get started in one of two ways: a local update or a fastboot update. For the former, devs must ensure their Xiaomi 15 is running OS2.0.109.0.VOCMIXM or higher. Owners of a 14T Pro need to have installed OS2.0.103.0.VNNMIXM or higher. The company has provided a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/global/support/guidance/androidtbeta#:~:text=use%20it%20immediately.-,How%20to%20upgrade%EF%BC%9A,-Method%201%3A%20Local">complete guide</a> on "how to" get started with the developer preview.</p><p>Xiaomi's post didn't tease any new features, so it's unclear if developers can expect to see anything new before a more public beta for users drops.</p>

<p>We're nearing the full release of a much earlier Android OS upgrade from Google as Android 16 reached "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Platform Stability</a>." The update in late March marked a major milestone for the next software update as Google progresses with a rapid timeline for the future of Android. Platform Stability means all in-app behaviors have been finalized, and developers are given one last call for final changes to their apps.</p><p>April will hold any last-minute adjustments from Google and developers before it drops in users' hands. Google said, "We’re putting additional energy into working with our device partners to bring the Q2 release to as many devices as possible." Android 16 is expected to launch by the end of June.</p><p>So, it's no surprise that Xiaomi is getting started on a developer preview of its own while it toils away at its HyperOS Android 16-skin.</p><p>Other OEMs have also started working on their Android 16 versions, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13-users-get-android-16-beta-2">OnePlus and its flagship 13 model</a>. Consumers with that device are getting their first glimpse of Android 16 as the company prepares for a rapid launch.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus 13 owners are in for a new experience as the company just announced that it is making Android 16 Beta 2 available to developers and advanced users.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1825773890316533761">detailed community post</a>, the company said that it is giving users early access to the latest Android experience. This is the first time that OnePlus has made a beta version of a new OS available to its users. With this release, it "hope(s) to empower app developers and early adopters in our community to build even better software experiences."</p><p>It should be noted that while this is Android 16 Beta 2 (Pixel phones are currently on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Beta 3</a>), this is the first Android 16 beta version available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="5yuQ8rnGKn9nvTuvdqmggH" name="Android-16-logo-orange-oneplus-13-01" alt="An orange and blue Android 16 logo on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5yuQ8rnGKn9nvTuvdqmggH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But before you get all excited, it is important to know that this upgrade isn't for new or inexperienced users who are unfamiliar with unstable software versions. And it also isn't for folks who use the OnePlus 13 as their primary device for daily tasks.</p><p>As the community post points out, there are notable bugs and issues that users will come across once they've upgraded to the Android 16 Beta 2. Some of them are that the device may restart when answering a call using Bluetooth headsets, users can encounter lag and display issues in the camera viewfinder and thumbnail in certain scenarios, the phone's camera crashes when switching between different camera modes, specifically the Macro mode and Ultra Steady mode.</p><p>That said, there are other issues that you may come across, making the device lag more than usual.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WJoYZ6JhzTLKVY3Mzuh27i" name="oneplus-13-multitasking" alt="Quickly juggling multiple apps on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJoYZ6JhzTLKVY3Mzuh27i.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For those who intend to go ahead with the upgrade, the company cautions users that "<em>there is a risk of bricking your phone"</em><strong> </strong>if they do not follow the upgrade manual to the T.  So it is advised that you back up all the important files on your phone before attempting to upgrade the software.</p><p>Other things to keep in mind during this upgrade are that the phone needs to have at least 30% battery and storage space of more than 4GB. Additionally, the current software version must be <em><strong>15.0.0.703 or below</strong></em> to upgrade to Android 16 Beta 2. "If you're on a higher version, you'll need to <strong>downgrade</strong> first," OnePlus added. Lastly, OnePlus 13 phones on T-Mobile and Verizon carriers are not compatible with the Android 16 Beta 2.</p><p>If you're someone who checks all the above boxes and is ready to give the beta a test drive, then be sure to follow this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1825773890316533761">upgrade guide</a> carefully to be one of the first people to experience Android 16 Beta 2 on OnePlus phones.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's security updates page no longer lists the Galaxy S20 series, meaning its software support has officially come to a close.</li><li>After receiving a "Quarterly" extension in 2024, the S20 flagship trio will no longer be updated; however, the S20 FE can stay a little longer.</li><li>Samsung has shifted to a seven-year support cycle for its phones, but that promise might not embody that sentiment to the core.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While many people coveted the Galaxy S20 series, April marks the end of it in the eyes of Samsung.</p><p>The end of OS and security update support for the Galaxy S20, S20 Plus, and S20 Ultra was made apparent in an updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb">Samsung security updates</a> page (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/08/galaxy-s20-series-out-of-updates/">9to5Google</a>). The once-flagship trio are no longer listed on the company's Monthly, Quarterly, or Biannual update cadence sections. This comes after the Galaxy S20 series was moved from Monthly to Quarterly a year ago during Samsung's software extension era.</p><p>After downloading the March 2025 security patch, users with these phones will (for sure) no longer see an update from Samsung. The publication highlights the possibility of another security update; however, that will likely only be in the most extreme cases for severe vulnerabilities.</p><p>While the S20 trio exits, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review">Galaxy S20 FE</a> (and its 5G variant) remains. The company's security page lists the device under its Quarterly update section. The FE variant is likely in for two more updates, one in Q2 and another in Q3, before it bids farewell, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="nAYPidDdg6gUw4k6UMoksG" name="galaxy-s20-ultra-lock-screen-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nAYPidDdg6gUw4k6UMoksG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S20 series should've come to a close a year ago; however, Samsung announced it would move the devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s20-series-wont-get-any-more-monthly-updates">from Monthly to Quarterly patches</a> in April 2024. After originally launching in 2020, the Korean OEM promised four years of software support for the trio. The phones would receive three major OS upgrades (Android 10 to 13) and four years of security updates.</p><p>With that, 2024 should've been the end — but Samsung saw otherwise for a selection of devices with quite a short support cycle. Aside from the S20 series and its FE model, Samsung extended support for the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, too. Of course, this only concerned security patches, as none of these devices grabbed Android 14.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">like the Galaxy S24 series</a>, Samsung has moved toward seven years of software support. The Galaxy S25 also received this treatment; however, there's more to unravel for its predecessors as "seven years of support" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">isn't what most users think</a>. In reality, while the S24 will receive Android 21 (in 2031, potentially), the device will likely have to miss out on major One UI features.</p><p>Samsung EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally, highlighted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">major toll its AI takes</a> on a phone's hardware in One UI 7. As such, many of its past-gen phones will not receive the next upgrade's Personal Data Engine, as it's far too reliant on the current hardware provided by the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p>

What if the AI assistant in your glasses could help you find them because it <em>remembers</em> where you last placed it? Whether this sounds creepy or not, it's certainly a new kind of superpower, and it's being made possible by an upcoming pair of Android XR smart glasses.</p><p>At TED 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/google-glasses-android-xr-translation">Good Good Good</a>), Google's head of augmented reality and extended reality, Shahram Izadi, debuted a pair of smart glasses that can do just this. We've seen these glasses hinted at before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">during Google I/O</a>, but this is the first time they were shown off live on stage.</p><p>The glasses are powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, Google's latest branch of Android that promises to make eXtended Reality (XR) — the overarching term that includes Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) — as prolific as Wear OS or Android Auto devices. It's possible these are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">Samsung HAEAN</a> smart glasses, but Google representatives didn't give a product name at the presentation.</p>

<p>During the presentation, Google product manager Nishtha Bhatia asked Gemini where she had left her hotel room key card, to which the AI promptly responded, "The hotel key card is to the left of the music record" on the shelf behind her. It's not known how long these glasses will be able to record footage during the day or how far this memory feature can go, but it's a killer app for both AI and smart glasses, to say the least.</p><p>The implications of virtual memory can be extraordinarily far-reaching. I think of my own grandparents who suffered from dementia and couldn't remember simple things throughout the day. Glasses like these would profoundly impact their lives, helping to significantly improve their quality of life had they been around to see this.</p><p>Previously, Google showed off this "superpower" during Google I/O 2024 while running an early version of Project Astra on a phone. You can view the original Project Astra demonstration, including the memory feature at timestamp 1:20 in the video below.</p>

<p>Izadi said "These glasses work with your phone, streaming back and forth, allowing the glasses to be very lightweight and access all of your phone apps," meaning the upcoming smart glasses project from Google will almost certainly only feature light onboard processing to ensure battery longevity. Project Astra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">is launching publicly soon</a> and will likely continue to run on your phone while a pair of smart glasses film the world around you.</p><p>The glasses shown at TED 2025 included a display in at least one of the lenses, although that particular functionality was only shown off briefly for a live translation demo where words were displayed on the lenses. We learned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">back in August 2023</a> that Google was working on several different pairs of smart glasses, including a pair with a single display and another pair with two displays — one in each lens.</p><p>This all comes as news surrounding next-generation smart glasses has been heating up. Meta is said to be debuting a next-gen Ray-Ban branded pair of smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">with a single display</a> this year, including a wristband <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">that allows phoneless interaction</a> with what you see on the glasses display.</p>

<p>We haven't heard of Google working on a similar wristband, which means the company will likely rely heavily on Gemini to control most of the interaction. I saw Project Astra firsthand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">at Google I/O last year</a> and came away impressed with the AI's capabilities to understand spatial relationships and interpret what it sees through a camera.</p><p>Google will be using this exact functionality in their smart glasses when they debut, although it's not known if this particular pair will be part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/what-to-expect-from-android-xr-in-2025">2025 Android XR lineup</a> or if we'll need to wait for next year to see them hit shelves.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-102">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung’s foldables have been a bit underwhelming lately, but 2025 could finally bring some big upgrades.</li><li>The Z Fold 7 might get an improved under-display camera and a tougher, more durable screen with new materials.</li><li>It might feature a bigger 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch cover display, up from the Z Fold 6’s 7.6-inch and 6.3-inch screens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s foldable crowd hasn’t exactly been blown away by the slow drip of upgrades. However, it’s looking like things might finally take a real turn in 2025.</p><p>A new report says that Samsung’s foldables might be in for a major glow-up in 2025. According to @TheGalox_ on X, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> could show up with an upgraded under-display camera and a tougher screen built with some fresh layered materials.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Z Fold7 | What's new?• One UI 8 out of the box• Upgraded Under Display Camera• Stronger Display with new layers• Bigger at 8" inside & 6.5" outside • New 200mp main camera • Thinner body at 4.5mm unfolded • Improved water & dust resistance • Smaller crease… pic.twitter.com/1zzVMwDJNE<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1909739032264728931">April 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223826994201&navType=by" target="_blank">buzz</a> that Samsung has been struggling to fine-tune its Under Display Camera tech both in terms of performance and keeping costs in check. So while the Z Fold 7 is still expected to pack a UDC, Samsung is reportedly already eyeing other options for future models.</p>
<h2 id="under-display-camera-last-hurrah-2">Under Display Camera – last hurrah?</h2>
<p>Funny enough, Samsung and Apple might be on the same page for once: both seem to be pumping the brakes on under-display cameras. If the rumors are right, the Galaxy Z Fold 8 and future flagships could ditch UDC entirely.</p><p>@TheGalox_ also backed up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-one-ui-8-preloaded/" target="_blank">recent report</a> claiming both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 are set to ship with One UI 8 right out of the box.</p><p>Even though Samsung fans weren’t too thrilled with how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> (Android 15) turned out, there’s a lot more hope riding on the next version of its custom UI.</p><p>Samsung seems to be moving pretty fast with its next software update, and it lines up with Android 16’s expected rollout. Google is aiming to drop the big update around June, after a round of beta testing.</p><p>The tipster also spilled some details about the Galaxy Z Fold 7 getting a size boost. Rumor has it the main foldable screen could stretch to 8 inches, with the cover display hitting 6.5 inches.</p><p>For comparison, the Z Fold 6 sports a 7.6-inch inner screen and a 6.3-inch outer one.</p><p>There's also a good chance the next model could come with an upgraded main camera, possibly hitting 200MP. That’s a major jump from the 50MP sensor in the current version.</p>
<h2 id="performance-and-durability-upgrades-2">Performance and durability upgrades</h2>
<p>Inside, the next foldable is expected to pack the faster Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. As for durability, the rumor points to a higher IP rating for better dust and water resistance. For comparison, the current Z Fold 6 has an IP48 rating, so the new model could come with even tougher protection against the elements.</p><p>The new device might have a slimmer design, possibly as thin as 4.5mm when unfolded. There’s also talk of a smoother fold, with less of a noticeable crease on the inside screen.</p><p>On top of that, a bigger vapor chamber is expected, which would help keep things cool during heavy tasks like gaming, improving long-term performance.</p>

<hr>
<p>While we await Samsung's personal robot reveal, the company is highlighting a new partnership to expand its AI capabilities later this summer.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-google-cloud-expand-partnership-bring-gemini-ballie-home-ai-companion-robot-by-samsung/">press release</a>, Samsung announced a new partnership with Google Cloud, which will bring the Gemini model to the personal home companion, Ballie. Samsung's executive vice president of the visual display business, Yongjae Kim, said, "By pairing Gemini’s powerful multimodal reasoning with Samsung’s AI capabilities in Ballie, we’re leveraging the power of open collaboration to unlock a new era of personalized AI companion."</p><p>For consumers, the post says Ballie will leverage Gemini's multimodal software alongside Samsung's language models to "process and understand a variety of inputs." Ballie is said to understand/process audio and the user's voice. Additionally, the AI companion can process visual data from its camera and sensor data from its environment.</p><p>With Gemini and Samsung's software, Ballie's behavior and responses are expected to "adapt in real-time."</p>
<h2 id="ballie-has-your-back-2">Ballie has your back</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PZ7Ro2xyyD6yFS2E5uMgYk" name="samsung-ballie-house-roaming" alt="An image of Samsung's upcoming yellow Ballie AI robot sitting on the floor by a sofa." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZ7Ro2xyyD6yFS2E5uMgYk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung states this partnership with Google should move Ballie into a personal position, allowing users to seek help for a variety of subjects. The post highlights Ballie's ability to help users with fashion choices in the morning. Samsung gives the following example: "Hey Ballie, how do I look?" The AI robot will reportedly examine you through its camera before offering a set of "styling recommendations," which could include accessories or an entirely new top.</p><p>Elsewhere, Ballie features health and wellness assistance. If a user is tired, Samsung says it can express this to the AI robot. Ballie will then use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini's Search engine abilities</a> to find how best to improve its users' energy levels.</p><p>Samsung confirms Ballie is preparing to launch "this summer" in the U.S. and South Korea. While the post highlights more personal AI assistance, the little yellow ball will also aid in smart home tasks like adjusting your lights, answering the door, setting reminders, and more. Samsung states it's still finalizing product specifications, so more concrete information about Ballie will be made available at a later time.</p><p>Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/projectors/home-robot-ballie/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom">sign up for Ballie updates</a> to stay in the loop.</p><p>Samsung first teased Ballie in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-ces-2020">a promo video five years ago,</a> during CES 2020. We got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-phone-subscription-club-service-detailed">surprising update about it</a> earlier this year in January from Samsung's vice chairman, Han Jong-hee, who said Ballie is preparing to launch in the U.S. and South Korea. However, Han Jong-hee stated the robot would see a "first half" of 2025 launch, which remains to be seen. If true, then Ballie would have to debut sometime between now and June.</p>

As exciting as that was, it didn't lead to a consistent user experience, so it's understandable that brands have tried to focus on that area in the last three years. Samsung in particular doesn't make many changes to One UI, eschewing constant change for familiarity. <br><br>That's what makes the One UI 7 update that much more notable; this is Samsung's biggest UI overhaul in a while, and it delivers an overall aesthetic that's cleaner, more modern, and with better customizability than ever before. Samsung clearly had issues managing the scale of the changes — most of its flagships still haven't picked up the Android 15-based update — but it is undeniable that One UI 7 heralds a new era of Samsung's software vision. <br><br>I started out with TouchWiz Nature UX 2.0 on the Galaxy S4, and used every subsequent version of Samsung's interface released over the last decade, including all One UI iterations. Here's what I think of One UI 7, and why I believe it is a pivotal update for Samsung's devices.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UwMjVfTLSekVMKi5UTRGS6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UwMjVfTLSekVMKi5UTRGS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung overhauled the interface with One UI 7, and it is a positive move overall. The interface now looks cleaner and has better colors throughout, and it is cohesive. Samsung tweaked the design of the icons as well, and they have better gradation and look a little more elegant. There's better customizability in this area as well, with One UI 7 allowing you to change the size of icons and disable text labels (finally).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S8y95DFkNxAKAQWLSiL2Y6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S8y95DFkNxAKAQWLSiL2Y6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Widgets are cleaner too, and the changes to the design make using One UI 7 that much more enjoyable. That said, Samsung maintained the right balance; while the UI looks modern, it's still immediately familiar. Samsung didn't make wholesale changes to how you  interact with the interface, instead updating elements that started showing their age.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vQocE8cZrRGBY5dEnE2qY6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQocE8cZrRGBY5dEnE2qY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the design tweaks are motivated by iOS, and there's no getting around that — most Android brands are guilty of doing this. Having said that, the implementation is quite different to what you get on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and Samsung did a good job "borrowing" some of these utilities and integrating them into its own interface.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PBuK2kmYnx8tuK7Wn8EkK6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PBuK2kmYnx8tuK7Wn8EkK6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A smaller update has to do with the battery; the icon in the status bar has a cleaner pill-sized design, but what I like the most is that it houses the percentage within the icon. This was a bugbear on One UI 6.1.1 as the percentage sat outside the icon, so it's good to see Samsung making this move.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vgD7GKCtitfmccLASo3ZX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vgD7GKCtitfmccLASo3ZX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another small tweak has to do with enlarged folders. This is something that ColorOS and MagicOS do really well, and Samsung is now aiming to follow suit. With bigger folders, you don't need to go into a folder to launch an app that's located inside, and it is highly convenient.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="43e7yMFvxHxZY2QZdL2GX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43e7yMFvxHxZY2QZdL2GX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a new Game Booster that lets you tweak settings in individual titles to maximize efficiency or performance, and it makes a difference. Galaxy AI continues to be a differentiator, and Samsung is building out a decent set of utilities in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cgiErQzYCdKBPFMeCw7XX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cgiErQzYCdKBPFMeCw7XX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The UI has better optimization, and that in turns means you get better fluidity even on mid-range devices like the Galaxy A56, where this has been a constant problem with previous iterations. That said, it doesn't quite have the same level of fluidity as ColorOS on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> or even Xiaomi's latest software running on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, but it is a decent change in the context of Samsung phones.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-has-a-split-notification-pane"><span>One UI 7 has a split notification pane</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RyjtVvD8GaKPQdHvbRoWT6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RyjtVvD8GaKPQdHvbRoWT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest difference in One UI 7 has to do with the notification pane; Samsung now uses a split shade with the toggles sitting on one side, and the notifications on the other. This is similar to iOS' Control Center, and most Chinese brands are also using a similar system. The pane isn't fully opaque, and it does a good job highlighting the background colors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZehJq5GU2mToGa2htS8iT6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZehJq5GU2mToGa2htS8iT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, you can switch back to a unified pane if that's what you prefer. While that's what I usually do on most Android phones, I found myself liking the split pane quite a bit; you get a greater number of controls in the toggles section, and a pull-down gesture anywhere on the screen surfaces the notification shade — to get to the toggles, you'll need to pull down from the top right corner.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PsbrZGWp8h36efwhhm6VX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PsbrZGWp8h36efwhhm6VX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The split pane shows volume control in addition to the standard brightness slider, and you get the usual smart home device controls and Modes (what Routines is now dubbed). You can switch between notifications and toggles by swiping right and left, and Samsung did all the right things in this regard.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-actually-added-a-vertically-scrolling-app-drawer"><span>Samsung actually added a vertically-scrolling app drawer</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L8Ao2eEm4nNu7kfcU5EzN6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L8Ao2eEm4nNu7kfcU5EzN6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most about One UI 7 is the introduction of a vertically-scrolling app drawer. Samsung was the only holdout to still use a horizontal app drawer, and it was constantly frustrating whenever I used one of its phones. I had to use Good Lock to switch to a vertically-scrolling drawer, and that was usually one of the first things I changed on Samsung's devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2H7fp6DmjohkCg5HUdAoY6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2H7fp6DmjohkCg5HUdAoY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With One UI 7 though, you don't need to go that route; the drawer scrolls vertically as standard, and it is a minor change that makes a big difference in usability — particularly if you're like me and have plenty of apps installed. Another positive change is the positioning of the search bar within the drawer; it is now located at the bottom, and that makes it easier to pull up.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-now-bar-provides-contextual-info-in-one-ui-7"><span>Now Bar provides contextual info in One UI 7</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PuXshukwQzpSUFBdhaT2a6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PuXshukwQzpSUFBdhaT2a6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like every other manufacturer, Samsung is emulating iOS' Dynamic Island, but because the Korean brand has to be different, its implementation is unlike that of any other device. The feature is dubbed Now Bar, and is basically shows things like media controls, timer, recorder, navigation, and other ongoing actions in a pill-sized box that sits at the bottom of the lock screen.</p>
<p>The idea is that you can interact with these actions without having to wake the screen, and I used it to good effect to control music playback in YouTube Music. Samsung has a secondary option called Live Notifications that sit in the status bar, and they do a similar thing — you can control music playback and other actions by selecting the icon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nSi9J5EderDC8UUvbERKG6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nSi9J5EderDC8UUvbERKG6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike most devices, these notifications aren't centered around the camera cutout, but sit to a side in the status bar. ColorOS does a better job handling these notifications, and Samsung needs to tweak the design a little bit in this area.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-overview-menu-is-much-better-in-one-ui-7"><span>The Overview menu is much better in One UI 7</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jDfiPkx4rzrYxPEYAKq9Q6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDfiPkx4rzrYxPEYAKq9Q6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung also changed the overview menu, and it has much better usability. Instead of one card dominating the view, you get a rolodex-like design that lets you preview cards in the background, and it is a much-needed change. The scrolling action when going through the recents menu is smoother as well.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Samsung hasn't changed the option to launch split-screen mode via the Overview menu. You can still press on an app icon and choose to go into split-screen mode effortlessly, and this is another small area where One UI has an advantage over its Android rivals.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-gets-a-brand-new-camera-interface"><span>One UI 7 gets a brand-new camera interface</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vsstohWf2ccfqGsDMnTo56" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vsstohWf2ccfqGsDMnTo56.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Along with the rest of the interface, Samsung cleaned up the camera UI, and it is much better organized. The shooting modes have been moved to the bottom of the viewfinder, and it's easier to switch between modes with your thumb. Most of the toggles and filters are hidden behind a settings button, and this ensures the interface isn't anywhere as cluttered.</p>
<p>Alongside better controls, you get good editing tools, and like every other brand, Samsung is leveraging AI to be the differentiator.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-better-battery-controls-higher-drain"><span>Better battery controls, higher drain</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YryCTAUTmQMYWbTXM9oHZ6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YryCTAUTmQMYWbTXM9oHZ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the One UI 7 beta builds in the past, and there was a noticeable decrease in battery life over One UI 6.1.1 on the S24+. This is still the case when I used the stable One UI 7 build on the Galaxy A56; the phone didn't last quite as long as its immediate rivals with equivalent batteries, so it's clear that Samsung needs to do additional tweaks to deliver better battery efficiency.</p>
<p>Samsung lags behind every other Android brand when it comes to battery tech, both in terms of charging and willingness to switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide tech</a> to deliver better density. But what I like is that battery protections are better in One UI 7; you can now set a charging limit and customize it between 80% to 95%, giving you much greater flexibility.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-is-slowly-making-its-way-to-the-best-samsung-phones"><span>One UI 7 is slowly making its way to the best Samsung phones</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d6iA7G4eDKNXdcXW3ZGnX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d6iA7G4eDKNXdcXW3ZGnX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is usually good with updates, but that just hasn't been the case with One UI 7. As of April 9, my Galaxy S24+ still hasn't picked up the stable One UI 7 build, and it is the only 2024 flagship to not make the switch to Android 15. Samsung clearly had challenges in getting the Android 15 build out the door, and it will only take longer for the brand's budget and mid-range devices to switch to the latest version of Android.</p>
<p>With Google accelerating the Android 16 launch, Samsung's delay means most of its devices will pick up Android 15 just as the next version of Android becomes available.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-is-a-great-overall-update"><span>One UI 7 is a great overall update</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kdJBmAimRUQpAsC3QQQhE6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kdJBmAimRUQpAsC3QQQhE6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The definition of a good update is when a brand introduces meaningful additions while still retaining the core feature-set, and Samsung did a great job nailing that balance with One UI 7. The changes to the design bring a level of vibrancy and dynamism to the interface, and it has better fluidity on mid-range devices. <br><br>The fundamentals are unchanged, so if you're used to call recording in the dialer, Samsung Internet, Samsung Messages, and the brand's unique customization options, those are still just as good as previous iterations of the interface. Ultimately, the only problem with One UI 7 is just how long it is taking to show up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>. But having used it for a while now, I can say that it is worth the wait.</p>

<ul><li>Google is adding a new version of Gemini to Android Studio that's specifically designed for businesses.</li><li>The exclusive tier prevents Google from saving company code, which won't be used for AI model training.</li><li>Google will also protect companies from IP claims against code created with the help of Gemini in Android Studio.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is introducing a new version of Gemini in Android Studio tailored for businesses that need AI coding help, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/gemini-in-android-studio-for-business.html" target="_blank">announced</a> today. The upgraded offering, available with Gemini Code Assist Standard or Enterprise subscriptions, adds security and intellectual property (IP) protections to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features already available.</p><p>The feature set includes many Gemini in Android Studio staples, like build and sync error support, Gemini-powered App Quality Insights, and Compose Preview Generation. On a larger scale, Gemini in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/reported-changes-to-android-development-arent-really-a-change">Android Studio</a> is supposed to help app developers work through the process of creating and maintaining an Android app. This version in particular is intended to address some of the concerns business owners and enterprises might have using AI to help with their apps.</p><p>These tools can be customized to match a company's internal codebase by linking to GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket repositories.</p><p>Notably, unlike other Gemini offerings, no code created with Gemini in Android Studio for businesses is stored with Google. Additionally, code isn't used to train new AI models. Using the Private Google Access, VPC Service Controls, and Enterprise Access Controls security features, businesses can completely control how their code is used and safeguarded.</p>

<p>Corporate IT departments may be pleased to learn that Gemini in Android Studio for businesses meets the following industry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-saif-risk-assessment-security-threats-details">security certifications</a>:</p>
<ul><li>SOC 1/2/3, ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management)</li><li>27017 (Cloud Security)</li><li>27018 (Protection of PII)</li><li>27701 (Privacy Information Management)</li></ul>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Google is providing companies with peace-of-mind with IP indemnification.</p><p>"Organizations will benefit from generative AI IP indemnification, safeguarding their organizations against third parties claiming copyright infringement related to the AI-generated code," Google explains. "This added layer of protection is the same indemnification policy we provide to Google Cloud customers using our generative AI APIs, and allows their developers to leverage the power of AI with greater confidence and reduced risk."</p><p>Companies interested in trying out this enterprise-grade version of Gemini in Android Studio can download the Android Studio Narwhal build from the Canary release channel. They'll also need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-adds-free-gemini-code-assist-tier-with-180-000-monthly-code-completions">active, eligible Gemini Code Assist license</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There's a rising trend of minimalist phones, with more and more of these hybrid oddities coming out recently. Unlike dumbphones, modern minimal phones such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-light-phone-3-is-here-with-miniature-features-massive-usd799-price-tag">Light Phone 3</a> and Minimal Phone come with Android and support a wide variety of the latest mobile apps.</p><p>So, what keeps them minimal? None of these minimalist devices have colored displays, making them non-intrusive and less distracting. They also have a limited OS and functionality, but not to the extent of dumbphones. Some of them don't even use a touch screen, like the Light Phone 3 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/">Punkt MP02</a>, favoring old-school keypads for input instead.</p><p>I find that this new-school variety of minimal phones is more appropriate for the current world as opposed to a dumbphone like the Nokia 2780.</p>
<h2 id="dumbphones-are-much-too-limited-for-today-2">Dumbphones are much too limited for today</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZUXh3ryJrZtUCQvi5xC4XU" name="Light-Phone-3-1" alt="The Light Phone III in lifestyle photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZUXh3ryJrZtUCQvi5xC4XU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Light Phone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why would anyone want a "less smart" phone, you ask? We're always distracted by our smartphones these days, and issues like doom-scrolling seriously kill motivation and focus. There is a small niche of people who don't want to be immersed in social media and be connected all the time, everywhere they go.</p><p>There are also other niches of older, more senior individuals who find modern flagships to be too complex, as well as kids who are much too young to have a full-fledged Android or iOS smartphone. Many people also like to have a secondary basic phone for times when they need to take a break from the internet and social media.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-dumb-phone">Dumbphones</a> are just nice for these groups of people, but they are extremely limited in their capabilities as they don't come with Android. While this is by design, the modern world demands a more balanced approach for such users.</p>
<h2 id="minimalist-phones-offer-a-more-balanced-approach-2">Minimalist phones offer a more balanced approach</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4351px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="MC6mD7F22YUeAT2rj5jLa9" name="minimal-phone-lifestyle-2" alt="Minimal Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MC6mD7F22YUeAT2rj5jLa9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4351" height="2447" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Minimal)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Take the Minimal Phone, for example. It started out as a concept device based on E Ink devices and Blackberry phones. After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/minimal-phone-concept">passing the design phase in January 2024</a>, the Minimal Phone finally started shipping on April 3, 2025 and can be purchased for $399.99. It's affordable, comes with Android 14, and has all the most desirable functions, such as a mic, speakers, a headphone jack, USB-C charging, GPS, and connectivity via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and cellular.</p><p>The Minimal Phone even has a camera, and you can install apps like WhatsApp, Uber, and Venmo on it. But it's nowhere near as interactive or distracting as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> because the B&W display lacks color and has no touchscreen. Since it uses an E Ink display, it has amazing battery life, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best e-readers and e-paper tablets</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NopNgUTd3FtGP9etuqavbG" name="Punkt-MP02-lifestyle" alt="Punkt.

<p>In fact, minimalist phones don't even sacrifice durability. The Punkt MP02 sports a regular TFT display, albeit still devoid of color, and what's more impressive is that it has an IP52 splash and dust-resistant rating.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-have-connectivity-but-still-disconnect-2">You can have connectivity but still disconnect</h2>
<p>Minimalist phones are all about intentional connectivity and balance. They offer peace of mind and the option to be on the grid — when you choose to do so. Unlike dumbphones, you can access a vast range of apps and tools, so you're not cut off entirely.</p><p>Despite the added functionality, minimalist phones still manage to disconnect from the fast pace of life. You don't get bombarded with information all the time, and you only log on to social media and the internet on your terms.</p><p>The muted monochrome screen brings solace to the chaos and busyness of feature-rich smartphones with all the bells and whistles imaginable. You're not tempted to constantly watch reels or TikTok videos. It's also very kind to your eyes, contributing to a more comfortable and relaxed user experience.</p><p>I truly believe that this is the right formula for a non-intrusive, uncomplex phone in 2025 as opposed to a dumbphone. It's a great way to slow down and take a breather without handicapping yourself from crucial tools important for everyday life.</p>

Sometimes, you'll get a great new feature that becomes an indispensable part of your everyday life. Other times, your favorite feature might get removed, never to see the light of day until 10 years later when something old becomes new again.</p><p>Case in point is widgets, a major feature of Android 1.0 that saw a significant decline in popularity after Google got rid of lock screen widgets in Android 5. But, as expected, what's old is new again. With the release of Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, lock screen widgets are becoming cool again. So much so, in fact, that Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/widgets-take-center-stage-with-samsung-oneui7.html">latest Android Developers blog post</a> focuses on how important widgets are for user engagement. Imagine that.</p><p>We first saw the groundwork being laid for lock screen widgets in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-lock-screen-widgets-spotted">beta build of Android 14</a>, followed by a full rollout of the feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> last September. More phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-bringing-widgets-to-phone-lock-screens-with-android-16-qpr1">will be getting the feature</a> with a quarterly update of Android 16, but Samsung is beating everyone else to the punch by including it on every device that has access to One UI 7 this year.</p>

<h2 id="faster-better-prettier-2">Faster, better, prettier</h2>

<p>Google's renewed interest in widgets really started to pop on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> last year when it launched a redesigned Pixel Weather app, which prominently featured widgets of all kinds. These widgets weren't just gorgeous looking; they also made it easy to see and understand a plethora of data at a glance.</p><p>While you can't break these widgets out of the app and place them individually on your home screen or lock screen (classic Google), many other apps are starting to take widgets more seriously, and Google Play is adapting. Developers can now show their app widgets right on the Play Store listing, and users can search specifically for apps that include widgets by using a handy filter.</p><p>I use widgets every single day to quickly take notes or access individual notes, control media playback with a dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> widget, search Google with text or visually with the Google widget, check my weekly meal plan with Our Groceries, quickly start by Roborock robot vacuum routines with a tap, and scroll through my calendar without having to find the app first.</p>

<p>But what I'm really interested in now is relearning how to use lock screen widgets again. These died in the Android 5 days when biometrics were becoming more commonplace as people stopped using their lock screens in favor of unlocking straight to the home screen. Things have changed, though, and we've learned to like our lock screens again.</p><p>Having separate widgets on the lock screen gives us one more surface to custom-tailor our day, and I know exactly what's going to be on there. That dedicated YouTube Music widget will always be on the lock screen, so I don't have to wonder if the OS is smart enough to know what I want.</p><p>A dedicated flashlight button alongside a handful of smart home toggles will await a single press from my thumb for activation, and a quick glance at the Strava health data from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> will keep me motivated to get moving. Oh, and don't forget the quick voice memo button in Google Keep that makes it handy to take a note at any time.</p><p>Meanwhile, my home screen will be reserved for more sensitive data like actual, scrollable notes, a quick glance at the latest emails and messages that just came in, as well as a little photo frame filled with my favorite memories. Widgets are wonderful, and I'm beyond delighted to see Google start caring about them again, especially in a day in age when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/good-lock-one-ui-7-update-is-great">Good Lock</a> makes it easy to fully customize the living crap out of my home and lock screens!</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Messages is rolling out a built-in “Unsubscribe” button to give you an easy way to shut down those automated texts for good.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-unsubscribe-button-3542411/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has spotted a fresh new feature popping up in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>. It's a little prompt at the end of spammy texts that says, “unsubscribe to stop receiving messages.” Once you tap it, you’ll get a quick pop-up asking why you’re opting out.</p><p>Google Messages has been on top of spam control for a while now. When a shady-looking text comes in, the app drops a little option letting you block the sender or report them on the spot. Tap it, and you’ll get a quick popup asking if you want to include a report before making it final.</p><p>The updated interface introduces a straightforward "Unsubscribe" button. When you tap it, a quick explanation pops up, letting you know it'll send a "Stop" message to the sender, telling them to back off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.20%;"><img id="NY54MzNproMrgohLPq7FeL" name="Google-Messages-new-unsubscribe-option" alt="Google Messages' new unsubscribe option to stop spam texts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NY54MzNproMrgohLPq7FeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="522" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you do get the option, you’ll be asked to pick from five reasons for opting out: “not signed up,” “too many messages,” “no longer interested,” “spam,” or “other. It gives you a bit more control over why you’re saying goodbye to those texts.</p>
<h2 id="oops-changed-your-mind-2">Oops, changed your mind?</h2>
<p>Once you’ve unsubscribed, you’ll see a “unsubscribe request sent” notice right under the “Stop” message. Furthermore, a “Start” button will pop up in the bottom-right corner, giving you the option to resubscribe to those automated texts if you change your mind later.</p><p>Google also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/guides/release-notes#march_25_2025" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that this feature is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-will-help-you-thwart-ads-and-spam-in-a-future-update">rolling out for RCS Business Messages</a>, and it's already being tested with users in the Google Messages beta program. At the moment, it’s focused on a few regions, including the U.S., UK, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Mexico, and Spain.</p><p>It’s pretty surprising that a feature this simple has taken so long to roll out. But if you haven’t seen it yet, don’t worry since it’s still being rolled out.</p>

<ul><li>A new leak revealed the alleged prices of Google's next flagship lineup.</li><li>It claims that the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL will see a $100 price hike this time around, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may drop to $1,600.</li><li>The Pixel line (standard Pixel, two Pro models, and one foldable) will allegedly remain the same until 2028.</li><li>The Google Pixel A-series will also be sold at the same price, $499 through 2028.</li></ul>

<p>Google Pixel 10 series rumors have been popping up a lot lately, with<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked"> official renders </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">specs</a> leaking way ahead of time. But the latest leak comes from “sources familiar with Google’s plans," both for the Pixel 10 model and the phones to come in the future.</p><p>A lengthy<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/author/alexander-maxham"> report </a>by Android Headlines claims that some models' pricing will change every year for the Google Pixel flagship series, while the others will stay at the same price point, at least until 2028.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-front-back" alt="A leaked look at the Pixel 10 Pro Fold rendering, showcasing its full internal display and rear panel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To start, the publication claims that the next flagship model, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a>, will see some price changes. While the standard and smaller Pro models will hold the same prices from the previous year, it looks like the Pixel Pro XL will see a $ $100 price bump. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will allegedly get a $200 reduction in its price, bringing its price tag to $1600, which is in line with a previous rumor we spotted earlier this month.</p><p>Next up is the A-series, or Google's budget devices. Android Headlines claims that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Pixel 10a</a> will be sold at the same $499 price point as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>. Furthermore, the company will reportedly stick to the same price until 2028 with the Pixel 12a.</p><p>Ultimately, it looks like Google has no plans to switch up its lineup any time soon, even though we feel future Pixel A and base Pixel models should be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-shouldve-merged-the-pixel-9-and-9a">merged into one phone</a>, bringing a device somewhere in the middle with the best of both worlds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9FLdumVShuzvyLrfbXuMHm" name="Google-pixel-9a-pixel-9-3" alt="The Pixel 9a and Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9FLdumVShuzvyLrfbXuMHm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thus, as for Google's flagship phone plans for the future, the report states that Google will stick to releasing a base model, two Pro phones, a foldable, and a budget device every single year up until 2028.</p><p>This contradicts some rumors that the tech giant would let go of the smaller Pro model sometime in the future. However, according to Android Headlines, this won't happen at least for the next three years.</p><p>Lastly, sources privy to Google's plans told the publication that as the years go by, Google's foldables will also start getting cheaper. “The Pixel Fold model will actually drop in price by the time we get to 2028," Android Headlines stated. It further goes to say that the 2027 Pixel Pro Fold model will see a lower price point of $1500, as the news site assumes Google could be using less expensive hardware for these phones.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1juga19/comment/mm235rh">Comment</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>However, these are still leaks and are subject to a lot of changes in the future. Considering U.S. tariffs are at play even when it comes to electronics, it is hard to say how many of these claims are actually true.</p><p>In a separate Reddit post, someone  from Android Headlines said that they've seen the pricing for Pixel 10, 11, 12, and 13 series, but “it’s all subject to change” and that “everything is a rumor until the company announces it lol.”</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is now rolling out Loss of Pulse Detection, a new safety feature for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, to U.S. users. The feature was originally marketed as a Pixel Watch 3 feature last year, and became available in other regions, but required FDA approval before it could work in the U.S.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">earned that approval in February 2025</a>, and Loss of Pulse Detection will become available in the country starting today, with a full rollout lasting a few weeks.</p><p>After earning FDA approval, the company announced Loss of Pulse Detection for U.S. users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">as part of the March Pixel Feature Drop</a>. Originally, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-fda/" target="_blank">said</a> it would "begin rolling it out in the U.S. at the end of March." That deadline passed, but now the feature is shipping as of April 8, 2025.</p><p>Loss of Pulse Detection is a critical safety feature that Google explains can "detect when you’ve experienced a loss of pulse" and "automatically prompt a call to emergency services for potentially life-saving care if you’re unresponsive." It adds a new element to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-extra-step-for-emergency-sos-on-the-pixel-watch-is-now-available">Emergency SOS</a>, which can be used to call emergency services quickly from your smartwatch.</p>

<p>Loss of Pulse Detection is opt-in, so you'll need to manually enable it when the feature becomes available on your device. To do so, open the <strong>Google Pixel Watch app</strong> on your phone and tap <strong>Safety and Emergency</strong>. Then, press <strong>Loss of Pulse Detection</strong>, and follow the on-screen prompts to enable the safety tool. After that, the feature will monitor your heart rate and try to detect when and if your pulse can't be found.</p><p>Prior to launching in the U.S., Loss of Pulse Detection has been available in 14 countries. The feature first arrived on Pixel Watch 3 for users in the EU last year.</p><p>It's rolling out starting today, but may take "a couple" of weeks before it arrives on all U.S. Pixel Watch 3 devices. The announcement comes as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/google-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-pixel-watch-models">Google releases the April 2025 update</a> for all Pixel Watch models.</p>

<p>Curiously, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-delays-galaxy-s25-edge-release-from-april-to-may-or-june-2025">isn't the first time</a> we've heard rumors of the Galaxy S25 Edge's supposed launch date. Originally, there was speculation that the phone would debut in April; however, rumors quickly refuted that, stating Samsung may seek a May or June release. The report earlier this month stated the company had reportedly provided such launch details to telecom providers in South Korea to prepare them.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/looks-like-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-could-launch-in-two-weeks">listing in the Netherlands</a> showed the S25 Edge would've launched on April 15, but the strange delay has seemingly cropped up without much insight into why. With current rumors alleging a late May," perhaps a June launch is more likely for consumers in other regions, like the U.S.</p><p>Additional rumors state the phone measures ~5.8mm in thickness with a 6.7-inch display. While unconfirmed, there's strong speculation that Samsung could provide the Snapdragon 8 Elite inside the S25 Edge like its flagship trio. Elsewhere, rumors may have given us an idea about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/the-galaxy-s25-edge-might-surprise-with-higher-prices-for-certain-models">phone's pricing range</a> for its models. It seems consumers should brace for 12GB of RAM paired with 256GB or 512GB of storage.</p><p>However, the prices could vary for each. A report states the 256GB option could debut between €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400). This could jump slightly for the 512GB as it could receive a €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520) starting price. Users may also have a choice between Titanium Icy Blue, Titanium Jet Black, and Titanium Silver for colors.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google seems to be going after businesses and establishments that have fake five-star reviews with the help of Gemini.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-business-profiles-ai-fake-reviews/#:~:text=Our%20progress%20in%202024,that%20repeatedly%20violated%20our%20policies.">Keyword</a> blog, Google explained how AI was able to track down over 10,000 listings managed by a group of "bad actors who impersonated real locksmiths to take over unclaimed Business Profiles and overcharge unsuspecting customers."</p><p>People rely on Google Maps for all sorts of information, from helping with navigation to looking up the best businesses in their area. When you look up a new restaurant you'd want to explore, you'd first check its reviews to see how it compares to the rest and trust that these reviews have been penned down by genuine people who've visited the place.</p><p>This is why Google has been after businesses trying to trick customers into visiting their locations with fake five-star reviews from people who have not been to the establishments.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d8zfTTjiAXzmvpsXrYWzFh" name="Google-Maps-Fake-reviews-alert" alt="Alerts on Google Maps disabling reviews for a business" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d8zfTTjiAXzmvpsXrYWzFh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It even seems to have trained a specific Gemini model that will also detect businesses that suddenly change their category. For instance if a cafe turned into a plumbing service, Gemini will identify it as a potentially suspicious profile.</p><p>"This new model has already helped us block thousands of suspicious Business Profile edits this year," the company said in the post.</p><p>Additionally, Gemini is now able to detect fake reviews on establishments several months after the user posted the original review. The tech giant stated that Gemini can "now revisit reviews more frequently to identify new abuse patterns. "</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ERpQEgeCnpxkoeG283bSR6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-google-maps-03.jpg" alt="Viewing Google Maps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4's smaller cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ERpQEgeCnpxkoeG283bSR6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, on the business front, the company is issuing alerts to business profiles in the U.S., U.K., and India when fake engagements or reviews are detected. This will be in the form of a banner alert within the app that states, "Google recently removed suspicious five-star reviews" from their profiles.</p><p>Lastly, if certain users are repeat offenders of fake engagement, Google says it will either temporarily disable their ability to post reviews or temporarily hide reviews for that establishment.</p><p>Google stated that in 2024, Gemini detected over 240 million policy-violating reviews, 70 million edits to places on Maps, and 12 million fake Business Profiles. These profiles were either blocked or removed, and posting restrictions were placed on over 900,000 accounts for repeated policy violations.</p>
