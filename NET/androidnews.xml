                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Rolling Square does a good job with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/rolling-square-incharge-xs-240w-keyring-cable-great-daily-use">inCharge cables</a>; I've had the inCharge XS on my desk for over a year now, and I use it daily to charge phones and transfer data. I like that the cable has all the connectors I need, and Rolling Square is now building on this idea with the introduction of the inCharge Life.</p><p>Instead of connectors, the inCharge Life has a unique modular system that lets you transform the cable based on need. Just want a short cable at your desk? It's available in a standard 4ft length. If you need a longer cable, you can use the cable extender and attach an additional 8ft. There are six cables in total, going from 0.5ft to 8ft, covering all use cases — Rolling Square even has a coiled cable that's ideal to use with a keyboard.</p><p>All cables deliver 240W of power, 10Gbps data as standard, and have status LEDs that light up while charging. They're touted to be the most durable USB-C cables around; with a zinc-aluminum alloy housing, silicone sleeve, and braided nylon design, Rolling Square says these cables are designed to last, and it's doubling down on that by offering a lifetime guarantee.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Vbshucgb4X3Cn7kAnZQxcd" name="Rolling Square inCharge Life" alt="Rolling Square inCharge Life" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vbshucgb4X3Cn7kAnZQxcd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3556" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rolling Square)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Should you notice any issues with the inCharge Life cable, you'll just need to take a short video of yourself cutting the cable, and Rolling Square will just send a new one. This policy is similar to what Peak Design does with its travel products, and it's interesting to see Rolling Square go the same route with cables.</p><p>The inCharge Life comes as a Keyring Cable with 0.5ft length, a 1ft Travel Cable, a 4ft Desk Cable, 5ft Dual Cable that lets you charge two devices simultaneously, 6ft Coiled Cable, and an 8ft XL Long Cable. The brand is rolling out cable extenders and an accessory that lets you hook the cable to a keyring.</p><p>As for the cost, you can build your own kit, with each cable starting at $29. That's considerably costlier than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">best USB-C cables</a>, but you're basically getting a lifetime guarantee.</p><p>You can also get the full set of six cables — which comes with a bundled travel pouch — that costs $127 or choose between a travel or home kit. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rollingsquare/incharge-life-240w-usb-c-modular-cable-kit-lifetime-system">brand is crowdfunding via Kickstarter</a>, and seeing as how it picked up over $500,000 worth of pledges in under a week, there's clearly a decent amount of interest in these cables. There's just under a month to go, so if you like the look of these cables and want something that comes with a lifetime guarantee, you should act now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've used several INIU products in the past, and its latest power bank does a great job delivering the same great features as its bigger siblings in an easy-to-use size.</p><p>The P50 is a 45W power bank with two USB-C ports alongside a USB-A connector, and it comes with a built-in cable that doubles as a lanyard. The smaller size is the big draw with this power bank, and you also get an LCD panel that shows remaining battery life. I used this power bank to charge my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>, and a slate of accessories in the last month, and I now use it as my go-to travel choice whenever I don't need a magnetic power bank. The best part is that the P50 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/INIU-Portable-10000mAh-Essentials-Powerbank/dp/B0DQD35SQ4">now down to just $26 on Amazon</a>, making it an unmissable value.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="40357ce2-116f-4c72-8601-4872f24c15c9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The INIU P50 is a no-brainer recommendation if you need a small travel-friendly power bank that you can take anywhere.

The 10,000mAh battery is able to fully charge any phone without a hassle, and with 45W power, you don't need to wait too long to charge your devices.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a retractable cable. While I like that there's a bundled cable, a retractable cable would have been better.</p><p>I like that INIU retained the same design as its larger power banks; while other brands switched to a vertical design, I find this design to be easier to use — at least when it comes to travel. The small size and lightweight design means you can take the P50 anywhere, and it has good build quality.</p><p>You don't usually see USB-A ports on power banks this small, so that's a welcome move. In a similar vein, it's good that there are two USB-C ports on the P50. The built-in cable means you don't have to dig around in your bag to find a charging cable, and while it is short, it doesn't limit usability in any way.</p><p>Charging itself is reliable, and there are no issues in this regard. The P50 goes up to 45W via the USB PD standard, making it a great choice to use with Google and Samsung phones. This is a solid choice if you need a new power bank, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/INIU-Portable-10000mAh-Essentials-Powerbank/dp/B0DQD35SQ4">coming in at just $26</a>, it is a pretty good deal.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both fit in the relatively affordable yet premium category. They're fantastic phones from reputable brands; you can't go wrong with either, given the reputations of their respective previous generation models. So, the question isn't whether you should get one of these devices if you want a phone with a massive screen. Which one should you get?</p><p>We're here to help by comparing them in the most important ways. Please note that the OnePlus 15 is currently only available in China, and we will not have specific details about the North American market version until later this month. With that said, some specifications, such as charging speed, may differ for that device. However, it's likely that the phone should, by and large, boast the same specs for the U.S. and Canada as it has in China.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-on-the-outside-counts-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: On the outside counts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vKJ2HLFpiL3eQUWHFPPu5h" name="oneplus-15-showcase-qualcomm-summit" alt="OnePlus executive holding OnePlus 15 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKJ2HLFpiL3eQUWHFPPu5h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, we'll dive into the look, feel, and durability. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a>, as noted, is currently only available in China but is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/a-redefining-global-launch-for-the-oneplus-15-lands-in-the-us-in-november" target="_blank">expected to be released soon in North America.</a> It features a 6.78-inch LTPO screen with a 2,772 x 2,772 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, which can be boosted to 165Hz for gaming experiences like <em>Call of Duty </em>and <em>Clash of Clans</em>. Get up to 1,800 nits brightness.</p><p>With a matte texture and boxy design based on early renders, it also has a distinctive camera island. On the side is the dedicated Plus Mind button for customized actions. It comes with 256GB or 512GB storage, sadly missing a 1TB option.</p><p>Where it really shines, however, is in durability. It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/is-the-oneplus-15-waterproof">not only water-resistant with the usual IP68 rating</a>. It doesn't even <em>just </em>have an IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> rating like the previous-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. It also meets an IP66 rating for resistance to dust and water pressure, as well as an IP69K rating for close-range high temperature and high-pressure water jets. You could literally toss this phone in the top rack of a dishwasher, run a cycle, and it should be fine.</p><p>It also excels in terms of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-battery-life">battery life</a>, boasting a massive 7,300 mAh silicon battery that can theoretically last for up to two days before needing to be recharged. Further, it supports ultra-fast charging at 80W or up to 100W (depending on where you live) with the SUPERVOOC charger and up to 50W wireless with the AIRVOOC charger. This is virtually unmatched by any other phone, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL included, and perhaps only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">OPPO Find X9 Pro</a> is the exception.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="saUAET58RZ9nafRP93iwDA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saUAET58RZ9nafRP93iwDA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5144" height="2897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Comparatively, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is made from a mix of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and aluminum that gives it a premium feel. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Nicholas Sutrich in his review</a>,  it looks identical to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Admittedly, it's heavier and bulkier than you might like, especially with the added weight required to incorporate Pixelsnap magnets on the back for magnetically attaching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2 accessories</a>, such as portable chargers and grips. This decision, however, is a long-overdue and smart one, marking the first Android phone that can work with Qi2 accessories out of the box, without a case.</p><p>It features a large 6.8-inch Super Actua QHD+ OLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, a 2,992 x 1,344 resolution, and a peak brightness of up to 3,300 nits, which Sutrich says makes it "ridiculously easy to see outside." Get it in 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB capacities. It's durable, too, but it "only" meets an IP68 rating. So, you can dunk it in water, even keep it submerged for a short period of time. But it's nowhere near as durable as the OnePlus 15.</p><p>In terms of battery life, it has a 5,200mAh battery and supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-charging-speed">45W wired</a> and 25W wireless Qi2 charging. That sounds incredibly fast, and it is. However, the OnePlus 15 stands out in terms of both battery life and charging speeds. Sutrich says he only noticed meager improvements to battery life with the Pixel 10 Pro XL compared to the previous generation phones.</p><p>One area where Google has a leg up is in terms of support and longevity. You get seven years of software and security updates with the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, while the OnePlus 15 will presumably only come with four years of major Android OS updates and six years of security patches. That's still pretty good, but it's something worth considering if you want a phone you can hang onto for as long as possible.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</h2><p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison of their key specs.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 15</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16, (OxygenOS 16)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Infinite Black, Sand Storm, Ultra Violet</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain, Obsidian</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.78 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.8 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,772 x 2,772</p></td><td  ><p>2,992 x 1,344 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>LTPO</p></td><td  ><p>LTPO OLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz (up to 165Hz for gaming)</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB, 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB (not expandable)</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB (not expandable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 50MP telephoto, 32MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide, 40MP ultra-wide, 48MP telephoto, 42MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,300mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wired charging</p></td><td  ><p>80W, 100W</p></td><td  ><p>39W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>6.0</p></td><td  ><p>6.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>161.42 x 76.67 x 8.2 mm (8mm for Sand Storm)</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>211-215 grams</p></td><td  ><p>232 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-features-functions-and-performance-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Features, functions, and performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oxkKtYSJBUcYSXvpsSNuPb" name="OnePlus-15-First-look" alt="OnePlus 15 first look at Qualcomm summit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oxkKtYSJBUcYSXvpsSNuPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Running on Oxygen OS 16 and OnePlus AI with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>, the OnePlus 15 boasts a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> processor with a touch response chip and an advanced Wi-Fi chip.

But it will handle multitasking and light to moderate gaming. It's still a powerful phone, but it won't keep up with the OnePlus 15 for the most intense activities. You do get 16GB RAM with every variation, along with deep Gemini integration, including Gemini Live.

With the OnePlus 15, you're getting an incredibly durable and powerful phone that will keep up with the needs of heavy users. That's especially so thanks to efficient cooling, powerful processing, and extremely long battery life.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is also a powerful phone, but it comes with some concessions in areas such as battery life, durability, and processing power. However, you also get a clean Android experience with fantastic Gemini and overall AI integration across the board, along with an intuitive user experience. You'll also get a few more years of support for software and security updates, and Google does Feature Drops at least twice a year, always bringing fresh and new experiences to the phone.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is a great phone for productivity and light entertainment, while the OnePlus 15 is more of a powerhouse phone for activities like gaming and advanced photo capture, though it has intelligence built in, too.</p><p>You can't go wrong with either phone. The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL already makes our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a>, and it's a certainty that the OnePlus 15 will replace the OnePlus 13 on that list. If you're an ultra-power user who games a lot on your phone and works out in the field, the OnePlus 15 is an enticing option worth considering. If you feel like you don't need all the added processing power and durability and just want a simple and familiar experience, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is a good option, too. Both give you a lot of phone for a huge price tag.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="25c9252a-47d4-4487-97c9-4aaf4003c3d2">            <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/launch/oneplus-15" data-model-name="OnePlus 15" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best for power users</strong></em></p><p>If you're a heavy power user who multitasks, plays intense mobile games, travels, maybe even works outdoors, the OnePlus 15 is an option you should consider.

Now, the company is pulling the curtain on a budget pair of wireless earbuds called the Moto Buds Bass, per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/moto-buds-bass/Welcome-to-the-moto-buds-bass-Community/m-p/10010302" target="_blank">Lenovo forums post</a>. They retail for around $65 and pack the same 12.4mm dynamic drivers as the Moto Buds Plus.</p><p>Moto Buds Bass are available now for £49.99 in the U.K. and €59.99 in Europe, and the price point appears to be incredibly attractive considering the earbuds' feature set. There are three microphones onboard for active noise-canceling and CrystalTalk AI for voice calls. Plus, the earbuds offer up to nine hours of battery life that extends to 43 hours with the case.</p><p>Motorola says the Moto Buds Bass have a 12.4mm dynamic driver that is specifically tuned for low-end sounds, hence the earbuds' name. They support Hi-Res Audio certification, too. The company says these budget earbuds can deliver three times more audio data compared to standard 16-bit/96dB CD quality.</p><p>Moto Buds Bass' ship with Dynamic Active Noise Cancellation that is claimed to cancel out up to 50dB of sounds, which is pretty impressive for budget earbuds. There's an Adaptive ANC that adjusts on the fly based on the wearer's environment. Plus, you have a transparency mode that lets sound through the Buds Bass, which is handy while being out and about.</p><p>Like many of Motorola's recent releases, the Moto Buds Bass are offered in three Pantone colorways. You can grab the earbuds in Dark Shadow, Blue Jewel, and Posy Green.</p><h2 id="where-do-the-moto-buds-bass-fall-short-2">Where do the Moto Buds Bass fall short? </h2><p>While the Moto Buds Bass feature impressive specs, there are a few drawbacks to note. The earbuds don't have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">official IP rating</a>. Motorola says the Buds Bass have a "water-repellent design," but the company also clearly states they are "not waterproof." Without an IP rating, we wouldn't recommend using the Buds Bass anywhere they could face significant amounts of sweat, water, or other liquids.</p><p>The earbuds' battery life estimates are also calculated with ANC switched off. There will be a noticeable dropoff in battery life when ANC is enabled, so keep that in mind. Finally, while Moto Buds Bass is available in the U.K. and Europe now, global availability is still up in the air (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/speakers/moto-just-revealed-super-cheap-wireless-earbuds-with-surprisingly-beefy-driver-and-hi-res-audio-certification" target="_blank">TechRadar</a>).</p> ]]></dc:content>

The update is rolling out now on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.android.app.galaxyregistry?langCd=en" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Store</a> with version 1.0.67, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-updates-good-locks-registar-three-improvements/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>. It brings a fix for a Gemini app bug on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip phones and two fixes related to Back Tap on all Galaxy phones.</p><p>The first element of the patch addresses a problem related to launching the Gemini app on the cover screen of a Galaxy Z Flip device. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7 and One UI 8</a>, Samsung brought full support for the Gemini app on the cover screen of  its clamshell foldables.</p><p>Additionally, the app update's release notes reveal Samsung applied a "Back Tap stability patch" to the RegiStar module. This should improve the success rate of Back Tap, a tool that allows users to open apps and access features by simply tapping the back of their Galaxy S or Galaxy Z device.</p><p>Separately, the RegiStar module update rolls out a fix for a "function error in power saving mode" for Back Tap. While the patch seems to exclusively include bug fixes with no new features, it's worth installing the RegiStar update, especially if you've been dealing with these issues.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-do-with-good-lock-s-registar-2">What can you do with Good Lock's RegiStar?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mAwXZ3VzpYjbPvkrDZnLce" name="samsung-good-lock-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Good Lock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mAwXZ3VzpYjbPvkrDZnLce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For those unfamiliar, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> is the home for custom software features aimed at power users trying to get the most out of their Galaxy phones.

The ongoing issues are seemingly incredibly specific, as users with the Opera GX browser are reporting problems en masse. The OP (original poster) reported that they were listening to music on YouTube in the background, but suddenly, everything stopped working.</p><p>The site went dark, and the thumbnails for the videos vanished.</p><p>While users thought this indicated that YouTube was down, or at least suffering from server problems, more reports claim that ad blockers might be the problem. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1oqtrnc/comment/nnl83is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user states that</a> accessing YouTube through Opera GX suffers the same problem, while others say going in with a different browser doesn't cause an issue. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1oqtrnc/comment/nnl8a7n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">report says</a>, "Mine was also broken, seems to be Adblock related, as the site loads fine without it, and completely breaks with it. At least on my end."</p><p>Strangely, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1oqtrnc/comment/nnldy90/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">one user says</a> they've been unable to access YouTube through Opera GX with ad block enabled; however, going in with Google Chrome (with ad block) is perfectly fine.

If they're persisting for you, and you're using the Opera GX browser, try the solutions some users have suggested on Reddit. Perhaps that'll fix things, but it's not like users with AdBlock on YouTube haven't had their fair share of issues.</p><p>There was a problem earlier this summer with users and ad blockers, where reports claimed YouTube was "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-throttling-your-videos-anti-adblock-crusade-continues">slowing down</a>" their videos. The platform called an audible, opting to reportedly throttle or slow down videos for those using ad blockers.</p><p>Reports said the platform would delay videos and also try to send folks to a Google support page, as if it were a different issue. Of course, the support page suggested removing any extensions (like AdBlock).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-youtube-app.jpg" alt="The YouTube app listing on the Google Play Store, running on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-global-efforts-clock-ad-blockers">in this war against ad blockers</a> for a few years now, and it's tried all manner of methods.

While the active noise-cancelling (ANC) was excellent, I found the sound quality a bit flat for my taste. Since then, Bose has changed that sound signature, releasing one of my absolute favorite open-ear products, the Bose Open Ultra. I was also highly impressed with the Bose SoundLink Plus and how robust its audio playback is.</p><p>With those recent experiences, I was looking forward to seeing what Bose has done with the latest generation of the QuietComfort Ultra over-ear headphones! I’ll let you know right now, I was <em>definitely not disappointed</em> with the sound quality this time around. There are some things you should know before buying, though, so I’ll get into all of that below.</p><h2 class="article-body__section"

href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones" target="_blank">As full-size headphones go</a>, you get a relatively compact hard case to carry your headphones in. They fold up small to fit in the case, and you’ll find the included USB-C and 2.5mm-to-3.5 mm cables in a small pocket on the case's lid.</p><p>Some cosmetic changes were made this year: the matte finish of the first gen has been replaced with shiny metal earcup yokes. The 2nd generation QC Ultra Headphones are still incredibly comfortable during long periods of wear, due to their weight (~264 grams/9.3oz), a respectable amount of padding on the cans and the headband, and a clamping force that feels almost non-existent- and that’s a feat, considering that I have a huge melon.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="FCBUs6Wp4DHpCr3ZnJ9i87" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-metal-yoke-closeup.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) close up of the new polished metal ear cup yokes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FCBUs6Wp4DHpCr3ZnJ9i87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite having such a light clamping force, the headphones don’t wobble or make noise when walking, jogging, or working out. I was surprised by how well they stay in place when lying down on a weight bench. I'd advise against using them at the gym as they have no water-resistance rating, though.</p><p>Similar to the previous generation, you get a touch-sensitive volume strip, which also allows you to assign one of four shortcuts to trigger when you touch and hold it. USB-C charging is still on board, but this year, you also get USB-C audio support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tech-talk-what-is-lossless-audio" target="_blank">16-bit, 44.1 kHz, or 48kHz audio</a>, <em>and</em> you can charge while listening, in all modes this time around.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ELxPUWukrBKbdF3BcgEM57" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-lay-flat.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) laid flat on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELxPUWukrBKbdF3BcgEM57.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Also new is the ability to remove the headphones and lay them flat on a solid surface to disconnect from your source device, which took around four seconds during my testing. Lying flat for 20 minutes, the headphones will enter a deep sleep, power-saving mode. When I picked them up again, the QC Ultra 2nd Gen would wake and reconnect to the previously connected device in under 10 seconds every time.</p><p>Building on that, the headphones' wearing detection functionality has been top-notch. Highly responsive!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SrN4TYXhC24AvTEWFaBn4Z" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-wearing-bus" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) being worn by reviewer, testing the ANC on a busy street" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SrN4TYXhC24AvTEWFaBn4Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>New this year, you can completely deactivate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/tech-talk-what-is-anc-and-how-does-it-work">ANC</a> through the app. The ANC menu features an on/off toggle and a slider that allows you to adjust the noise cancellation level to your preference. Specifically, where the QC Ultra 2nd Gen excels over the competition, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s3-review">Bowers & Wilkins’ excellent Px7 S3</a>, is its ability to reduce high-frequency noise significantly.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones-under-100">Many competitors do a good job of hushing the noise of car engines</a> in a metropolitan landscape, but the <em>whoosh!</em> of cars passing by, the squeal of a subway car’s brakes, or airplane cabin noise is often where things fall apart. Not the case with the QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen).</p><p>In addition to my testing while out and about on the streets, I used 80dB of airplane cabin sound on YouTube to test high-frequency ANC, and the QC Ultra 2nd Gen continues to shine in this area.</p><p>One aspect of the ANC function that I enjoy is when you transition from the natural-sounding Aware mode to Quiet mode via the multifunction button on the right earcup; it takes a few seconds to fully activate. As the noise cancellation ramps up, ambient sounds gently fade into the background. While some may not like that, it’s a very pleasing auditory experience for me.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="cqFm8J2cLGNP3uXytVNAx6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-app-noise-control-half-way.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cqFm8J2cLGNP3uXytVNAx6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="dPJyPwXEvNH9dF9qjsQcs6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-app-home.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dPJyPwXEvNH9dF9qjsQcs6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Bgs5NnagLAHspV4oPptZx6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-app-noise-control.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bgs5NnagLAHspV4oPptZx6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="7cxCwZ5aQCS4t3q2iQhYr6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-self-voice.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cxCwZ5aQCS4t3q2iQhYr6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="pne3W42yTWXiXsZuA2ePc6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-app-EQ.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pne3W42yTWXiXsZuA2ePc6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What about the sound quality, though? Overall, the QC Ultra 2nd Gen’s default sound profile is a V curve with warm lows for modern music listeners, and solid clarity in the upper mid and high frequency ranges. The soundstage is fairly airy, with good stereo imaging, sound separation, and instrumentation. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail retrieval from these headphones as well.</p><p>The app includes a basic set of EQ presets and three-band EQ customization to get the sound closer to what works for you if the stock sound doesn’t completely do it. The headphones take well to those three-band adjustments. Just be careful with the bass slider — at higher volumes, you may experience some distortion.</p><p>Listening to Snoop Dogg’s “Tha Shiznit,” you can clearly hear a detail that often gets lost with other headphones: the sleigh bells in the background. In Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’,” you can hear the backing vocals that play during the intro as well.</p><p>Listening to Michael Abel’s “Violin Duel” from the “Chevalier” OST, the attack and decay of the aggressively bowed violins, where the martelé technique is being liberally applied, are rendered much better than I had anticipated.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="7HLb4ytyqUFqogB29eyqX7" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-modes.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HLb4ytyqUFqogB29eyqX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Listening to music and movies with the Immersive and Cinema modes was a mixed bag. One of the muddiest Hip Hop tracks known to man, Method Man’s “Biscuits,” sounds better with Immersive mode on, as it makes the vocals pop despite being buried by the bass.</p><p>However, on other tracks with more balanced mastering, I’ve found that while Immersive mode widens the soundstage a bit, it ultimately renders the treble a bit too bright for my liking. Not sibilant, though, so it isn’t all bad.</p><p>I also found myself deactivating both Immersive and Cinema mode when watching action movies like “Thor: Ragnarok” or “Blue Eye Samurai,” as it buries bass response in favor of pushing forward the frequencies that contain dialog. I can see how, with films that mix more chaotic sound design with dialogue, Cinema mode could be pretty helpful, but in movies and content with percussive sounds like Thor’s hammer clobbering minions in Surtur’s den, that thump gets diminished in an unsatisfying way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="v3b45G5t5xVtG4NvtcGAV7" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-plugged-into-DAP.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) connected to a FiiO M21 DAP" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v3b45G5t5xVtG4NvtcGAV7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="FZ9CekMxobY6zWhTNcrmc7" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-sennheiser-dongle.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) connected to the Sennheiser BTD700 dongle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZ9CekMxobY6zWhTNcrmc7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Final notes on sound quality:</p><ul><li>As good as the QC Ultra 2nd Gen sounds via AAC, the detail retrieval and overall sound quality reach a new level thanks to a great <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">DAC chip when plugged in via USB-C</a>. Sound quality is also great via the included analog cable.</li><li>Read my article here about using <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-btd-700-and-questyle-qcc-dongle-pro-hands-on">Bluetooth dongles with phones that don’t support aptX Adaptive</a>, like my Google Pixel 9. With Sennheiser’s BTD700 plugged into the phone and connected to the headphones, HiRes Wireless Audio is a delight. The downside is that you lose connection to the Bose app by going this route.</li><li>The headphones have been clutch on Google Meet and other video conference calls, using my <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Microsoft Surface Pro 11</a>, but listening to music is a different experience. Like the Pixel 9, hi-res codecs aren’t supported, so this is yet another use case for the BTD700. Streaming .flac files from my laptop over Bluetooth via the MusicBee Windows app is a much better experience with it.</li></ul><p>Having had the headphones for only a couple of weeks, I’ll need more time to test, but so far the battery life has been very good. The previous-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review">QC Ultra headphones</a> were rated for 24 hours or 18 hours with Immersive mode activated, while this second-generation model is rated for 30 hours or 24 hours with Immersive mode activated.</p><p>It’s going to take you three hours to fully charge them when drained, but a 15-minute charge will get you three hours of playback in a pinch. The good news is that with the addition of USB-C music, you can also charge while plugged in, so the number of times the headphones are dead and unusable for at least 15 minutes should be minimal.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen): What could use improvement</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Faffm3gBuvoDwokmYNh5e6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-microphones.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) closeup of the microphones on the ear cup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Faffm3gBuvoDwokmYNh5e6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tech-talk-what-is-lossless-audio"><strong>Lossless audio explained</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained"><strong>Bluetooth audio codecs explained</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio"><strong>Bluetooth LE Audio FAQ</strong></a></p></div></div><p>For the most part, my complaints are very minor. Starting with putting them away, you’ll need to position the cables and any dongles in a corner of the lid pocket for the case to close properly. This means that using the entire pocket is a non-starter.</p><p>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) doesn't support passive playback, which is a double-edged sword. On one hand, you get ANC and Aware mode functionality when wired. On the other hand, if the battery is dead, you can’t just plug in the aux cable and go, which feels like a missed opportunity.</p><p>Additionally, the built-in microphones don’t work when wired, so you’ll have to raise your phone to your mouth to chat. That brings me to my final area of improvement.</p><p>The call quality has definitely improved over the previous iteration, but with so many microphones on the QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) and at this price point, I expect it to be even stronger. It isn’t bad at all, but my voice could be clearer and a bit brighter. As it stands, in my testing, the sound quality is a bit bassy.</p><p>The bright spot, though, is the ability to use the app to control how much of your own voice you’ll hear while on a call.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-competition"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen): Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fQWSLU8xV8szXEMeSxnv4j" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-case" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 headphone case with cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fQWSLU8xV8szXEMeSxnv4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At $450, Bose has a lot of competition on sound quality, but the only other headphones that currently reach, and potentially exceed, its level of high-frequency noise cancellation are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">Sony’s WH-1000XM6</a>.</p><p>In terms of sound, there’s no clear winner between Sony and Bose, as the differences are very subjective.

Launched back in October 2022, the first-gen Pixel Watch was Google’s re-entry into the smartwatch market, built on a Samsung Exynos 9110 chip and running Wear OS 3.5 at launch.</p><h2 id="support-window-closed-2">Support window closed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past three years, it received multiple updates that improved performance and battery management, as well as two major version upgrades — from Wear OS 3.5 to Wear OS 4, and then to 5.1. With this latest patch, Google is effectively closing the book on major system updates for the device.</p><p>That said, Google isn’t abandoning the watch entirely. Users will still receive app and service updates through the Play Store, ensuring that essential functions remain usable for a while longer. But when it comes to full Wear OS upgrades and long-term improvements, this is the finish line.</p><p>If you’re still wearing the first-gen Pixel Watch, it’s recommended to install the October patch once it hits your device. You can check for it manually by heading to Settings → System → System Updates on your watch. It’s a relatively small update, but an important one for maintaining stability and security.</p><p>And while it’s bittersweet to see support end, the Pixel Watch has had a solid run: three years of updates and consistent improvements. From here on out, it’ll continue to work fine, but without the major Wear OS upgrades that the newer Pixel Watch lineup will enjoy.</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Will my apps still get updates?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Yes.

With Gemini's landmark-based assistance and smart alerts, users can now navigate more intuitively and seamlessly integrate real-world landmarks into their driving experience.</p><p>The company<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/gemini-navigation-features-landmark-lens/"> states Gemini is headed for Maps</a>, bringing its hands-free assistance alongside it. There are a handful of major updates that users can prepare to witness, starting with real-world landmarks when navigating their travels. The post states that, instead of just going off "turn left in 500 ft," or stop signs and traffic lights, Gemini brings forth more noticeable buildings, like gas stations.</p><p>With that, Google states Maps will inform you to "turn right" at the gas station up ahead or, perhaps, it'll name the nearest restaurant, so you're better informed on when to turn. This "landmark-based" navigation is rolling out to Android and iOS devices today (Nov 5).</p><p>To help you along in your navigation, Google Maps now leans on Gemini for proactive traffic alerts. If there are traffic jams, crashes, or anything that would impede any future travels, Maps will now send you a notification about it. Google states that these alerts can come through "even if you’re not actively navigating," so keep that in mind as these alerts roll out on Android and iOS today.</p><h2 id="gemini-arrives-for-navigation-2">Gemini arrives for navigation</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:484px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:123.97%;"><img id="KsdD8s5GwaQBMNnGacBM9V" name="google-maps-gemini-lens-update-coming-soon" alt="Gemini is headed for Google Maps with Lens in tow, helping users understand the establishments they visit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KsdD8s5GwaQBMNnGacBM9V.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="484" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:401px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:149.63%;"><img id="peHuQBkXdCM7wxMDULdr8V" name="google-maps-gemini-proactive-alerts-update" alt="Google Maps will soon deliver "proactive" updates about traffic jams, crashes, and more as a pop-up notification on Android and iOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/peHuQBkXdCM7wxMDULdr8V.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="401" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Gemini is, of course, a little more than a preemptive alert or navigational assistor, as the post highlights the inclusion of Lens and multi-step tasks. Regarding the former, Google Maps now has Lens built in with Gemini at its core. Users arriving at a restaurant can open Lens and ask about the establishment. When centered in the viewfinder, Google Maps' classic pin with the spots name will appear.</p><p>Users can voice their query or type it, and let Gemini explain "what's so popular" about the place they're at. Google teases that Gemini can also let you know if a local spot carries something particular you're looking for.</p><p>On the flip side, for multi-step tasks, Gemini can satisfy queries for something "budget-friendly" that also has "vegan options." Users can then lock in whatever destination Gemini and Google Maps produce, simplifying the navigation process to what feels like just a regular conversation. Moreover, Google says users can grant Gemini in Maps access to their Calendar.</p><p>If granted, the AI can throw in new events for you. Now, not all of this is available right away, as Google says Gemini's Lens capabilities in Maps will "roll out gradually later this month" for U.S. users in Android and iOS. Additionally, Gemini in navigation will soon hit Android and iOS devices "in the coming weeks," with an expected arrival on Android Auto in the future.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The decision to keep things exclusive to Pixel watches supposedly stems from growing competition as brands pursue proprietary alternatives, altering the Wear OS landscape.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/384182062/changes-to-google-s-clock-app-on-wear-os">Wear OS support thread</a>, the tech giant said it has halted support for its Clock app on all non-Pixel smartwatches. The post states, if you have a Pixel Watch, you won't be affected by this new decision. However, if you have "any other Wear OS" watch, you will see this change. To break this down, Google says that watches without the Clock app installed already will no longer find it available via the Play Store.</p><p>If you've already previously installed the Clock app, you can continue to use it, though you should know that it will no longer receive updates.</p><p>Google explains that the reason it's made this change is due to other "watch brands offering their own default clock apps on Wear OS." As a result, Google's Clock app, which you could previously download on, say, a Galaxy Watch, has been retracted. The clock is gone, as well as the included alarm, timer, and stopwatch functions within the app.</p><p>Some users on the Wear OS support thread have already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/384182062?hl=en&msgid=384318597">voiced their displeasure</a> with the move, but it seems that Google's decision is set in stone.

It's not my first marathon, but it feels like the first one I've properly trained for; I've more than doubled my monthly mileage with several 15- to 20-mile runs and hit a half-marathon PR.</p><p>It's been a useful opportunity to test recent watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-4-fitness-test-and-first-impressions">COROS APEX 4</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-fitness-test">Pixel Watch 4</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-2-hands-on-accuracy-test">Suunto Race 2</a>. However, I continued to wear my Garmin watch on my other wrist, not just as a control group for testing, but also because I relied on its metrics to stay on task during marathon training.</p><p>I'm no authority on running techniques or marathon training strategy; I'd be happy just to break the 4-hour barrier. However, I am familiar with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness" target="_blank">fitness watches</a> and accessories, and I can share which features (whether Garmin or otherwise) were the most useful for marathon prep as a dedicated amateur.</p><p>While following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-fitbit-ai-daily-run-recommendations-helped-me-run-better">AI run recommendations</a> is useful to a point, it was only by straying from Garmin's recommended path that I've achieved my marathon potential.</p><h2 id="keeping-things-simple-mileage-matters-most-2">Keeping things simple: Mileage matters most</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1956px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="mpb2bTVeBJGZVxWuLCV48C" name="Marathon-training-sheet" alt="A Google Sheet showing weeks of recommend run distances for a marathon, including how many miles I actually ran and whether I completed every workout that week, leading to the Garmin Tucson Marathon in November." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mpb2bTVeBJGZVxWuLCV48C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1956" height="1100" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I took Hal Higdon's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/">Novice 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-2-marathon/">Novice 2</a> plans and built my own custom workout calendar (screenshotted above) in Google Sheets. I aimed to finish the Novice 2 distances but gave myself the easier Novice 1 option as an off-ramp whenever I was exhausted or worried about muscle soreness.</p><p>The main thing Higdon stressed is not to overly complicate your training plan.</p><p>Novice or intermediate marathoners should "save their speedwork" for when they're "not doing a marathon mileage buildup," nor should you do strength training unless you're already a "gym rat," and even then, you should "cut back on the weights."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1906px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8XDsqC2GvZtQN7VdEPPKwL" name="Garmin-intermediate-marathon-training-plan" alt="The Garmin Connect intermediate marathon training plan, highlighting a specific week of training runs: Intervals, recovery, cross-training, intervals, and long run." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8XDsqC2GvZtQN7VdEPPKwL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1906" height="1072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Garmin marathon training plan </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/choosing-the-best-marathon-training-smartwatch-for-my-upcoming-garmin-marathon" target="_blank">smartwatch marathon training plans</a> emphasize speed work, strength training, and cross-training.

My training load focus widget reminds me to get as much low-aerobic load as possible. Low aerobic HR training builds your body's endurance, so that your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/blog/understand-aerobic-threshold/">aerobic threshold</a> — the steady-state HR where you can maintain a consistent pace for hours — stays low.</p><p>Basically, by following Garmin's low-aerobic demands, I'm hoping I can maintain a strong target pace during the race while keeping my heart rate steady, so I don't build up too much lactic acid in my muscles.</p><p>It's never fun having to slow down to a crawl, staring at your wrist until your HR falls back into the right zone; it drags out the workout when you'd rather be running freely. But it pays off in the long run.</p><h2 id="the-fitness-tech-i-ll-use-during-the-garmin-marathon-2">The fitness tech I'll use during the Garmin marathon</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bVnn6J5arjDsL7YFCoLzFU" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-race-prediction" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 sitting on a shoe, showing a Race Prediction widget with my projected marathon time for the Garmin Tucson Marathon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bVnn6J5arjDsL7YFCoLzFU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It feels thematically appropriate to use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> during the Garmin marathon, but that's not the reason I'll wear one.

Google successfully negotiated public bouts with NBCUniversal, Paramount, and Fox this year, but its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-is-ready-to-bring-back-abc-and-espn-but-theres-a-catch">ongoing battle with Disney</a> appears to be different. Disney's 21 channels have been unavailable on YouTube TV since Oct. 31 as the talks drag on into their second week.</p><p>Both sides have took to their various channels and platforms to advocate for a "fair" deal. The situation escalated Friday, Nov. 7 when an internal Disney memo leaked to the press — penned by Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN's chairman, and Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, the co-chairs of Disney Entertainment. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6787572/2025/11/07/espn-disney-memo-youtubetv-nfl/" target="_blank">The Athletic's</a> Andrew Marchand obtained the document, which accused YouTube TV as demanding special treatment:</p><div><blockquote><p>Rather than compete on a level playing field, Google’s YouTube TV has approached these negotiations as if it were the only player in the game...It goes without saying that the reason so many consumers value our programming above others is because we invest in the best talent, creators and content in the world, and we cannot allow anyone to undercut our ability to do so.</p><p>Disney's leaked internal memo</p></blockquote></div><p>YouTube TV responded with a strong statement alleging Disney intentionally leaked the memo to The Athletic.</p><p>"Once again, Disney is resorting to their old tactics like leaking documents to the press, negotiating in public through their paid talent and misrepresenting the facts including from the deals they’ve offered and taking credit for our product proposals," YouTube TV told Marchand, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AndrewMarchand/status/1986871064748769603" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p><p>"Our team stands ready to make a fair agreement in line with their deals with other distributors and we encourage Disney to come to the table and do what's best for our mutual customers."</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YouTube response: “Once again, Disney is resorting to their old tactics like leaking documents to the press, negotiating in public through their paid talent and misrepresenting the facts including from the deals they’ve offered and taking credit for our product proposals.

Smith, to try and sway public interest in the company's favor. Pat McAfee, a sports personality who appears on-air for ESPN in multiple capacities, similarly criticized the strategy (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/pat-mcafee-hosts-videos-youtube-tv-disney-carriage-dispute.html" target="_blank">Awful Announcing</a>):</p><div><blockquote><p>We need each other. A lot of people saying ‘greedy corporations,’ it’s like, yeah. We need each other, especially with where sports are right now. And we’re in the middle of it, so let’s get it done. And stop asking me to go to a website. I don’t want to do that, so stop … all you’re doing is pissing everybody off even more. So it’s like, let’s just not do that.</p><p>Pat McAfee</p></blockquote></div><p>In the leaked internal memo, Disney also expressed an unwillingness to budge from its stance on the ongoing content negotiations. "YouTube TV continues to insist on receiving preferential terms that are below market and has made few concessions," the memo reads.</p><p>In the meantime, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-and-disney-may-be-at-war-but-fans-caught-in-the-crossfire">both Google and Disney customers end up losing out</a>. The companies aren't faring well, either. Disney is said to be losing about $5 million per day in YouTube TV subscriber fees while its channels remain dark (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/disney-5m-everyday-off-youtube-tv.html" target="_blank">Awful Announcing</a>). YouTube TV is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-is-giving-users-usd10-credit">handing out a $10 monthly credit</a> to subscribers while Disney channels are unavailable.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Once enabled, you’ll be able to send and receive texts, images, videos, voice notes, and documents from people who use some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">leading text messaging apps</a> besides WhatsApp.</p><h2 id="custom-chat-view-2">Custom chat view</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4402px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.65%;"><img id="DNB7b83zqaXZtVTXj2SmKK" name="WhatsApp-cross-platform-messaging" alt="Third-party chats feature in WhatsApp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DNB7b83zqaXZtVTXj2SmKK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4402" height="3242" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Meta-owned platform lets you choose how these messages appear. You can mix them into your regular chats or keep them in a separate section called “Third-party chats.”</p><p>This change comes after the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) required major platforms, or “gatekeepers,” such as Meta, to ensure their services work with competitors.</p><p>Meta has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-details-dma-interoperability-plan">rolling up its sleeves for months to make this work</a> while trying to preserve WhatsApp’s privacy and encryption standards. That’s no small feat, considering other apps may use different protocols or security models.</p><h2 id="early-limitations-2">Early limitations</h2><p>Still, as promising as it sounds, there are a few caveats. For now, only one outside app — BirdyChat — is apparently eligible to work with WhatsApp in this early test phase. The rollout is also limited to users in the European region, at least for now, which makes sense since that’s where the DMA rules apply.</p><p>Some of WhatsApp’s hallmark features won’t be available on these external chats, either. This means that things like stickers, status updates, and disappearing messages aren’t available outside the native app.</p><p>There are also some privacy concerns. For example, if you block someone on WhatsApp, they might still reach you through another app unless that app blocks them too. The only personal data shared is your phone number.</p><p>For most users, this test could show what the future of messaging looks like, where you aren’t limited by brand loyalty. If Meta succeeds, WhatsApp could be the first major texting app to offer real cross-platform communication.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's not because I need one, but it's always good to have one, just in case. For nearly two years, I've relied on an Anker Nano Power Bank (A1259), which has been very reliable. Now, there's a newer version, and I finally got my hands on it.</p><p>There are several notable differences between the two chargers, ranging from design to cable, charging speed, capabilities, and more. Overall, it's a fantastic charger that I would recommend to anyone, especially if you can find a great deal on it.

It's not too bulky, and it has a built-in USB-C cable that acts as a loop, making it easy to carry around. It's a pretty strong cable, and in my years of owning the charger, the cable has never faltered.</p><p>The new Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) switches things up quite a bit, and I'm not fully convinced that I like it. It's still relatively small, but it features a bulkier design than before. It's not quite something you can slide into a pocket like the previous model, and it feels a bit like a small brick or a large rock in my hand, weighing roughly 231.3g, whereas the older model weighs just 215g.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="VzdR5mdD6fegjNxxvskDcb" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1259" alt="The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1259) USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VzdR5mdD6fegjNxxvskDcb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1259) USB-C cable. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Gcs5wsYWdQtsm3iG5x7oCc" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1638-1" alt="A hand pulling the Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) retractable USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gcs5wsYWdQtsm3iG5x7oCc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) has a retractable USB-C cable that hides in the body. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>And while I may not care too much about the new design, there's actually a good reason for it: the new, retractable USB-C cable no longer functions as a loop and is instead hidden inside the charger. This way, not only do you get a built-in cable, but it's also much longer than the previous model when fully extended, at 2.3 feet, making it much more useful.</p><p>Anker says that it weighs about the same as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-max-review">iPhone 17 Pro Max</a>, which is the heaviest model of the lineup.

This is great, because phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> top out at 45W wired charging. While there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> with even faster charging speeds, the speed bump should still prove useful for these phones.</p><p>As an example, I've been using it to charge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, which supports a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-charging-speed">68W charging speed</a>. With a 100W+ wall charger, the Razr’s 4,700mAh battery tops up in just 40 minutes. Here's how quickly the phone charges from 0% to 100% using both the older and newer Anker Nano portable chargers:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Anker Power Bank</p></th><th  ><p>A1638</p></th><th  ><p>A1259</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>0-50%</p></td><td  ><p>22 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>30 minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>0-100%</p></td><td  ><p>49 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>1h 5m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Remaining</p></td><td  ><p>49%</p></td><td  ><p>42%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see, the newer model charges the Razr battery in less than an hour, while I have to wait over an hour with the older model. It's not a huge difference, but any charging speed improvements are welcome, especially when dealing with larger batteries.</p><p>Both models also differed in the amount of capacity they had left after providing the Razr with a full charge, with a difference of 7%. Of course, this could also be due to the age of the older charger, resulting in a reduced capacity. Therefore, don't expect two full charges on phones with larger batteries, but you will still get a decent second charge.</p><p>Of course, you can charge multiple devices at once, which is also convenient, but the charging speed is significantly reduced, especially when charging three devices simultaneously. Therefore, I would only utilize this option as a last resort.</p><p>And if you don't have a particularly fast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">wall charger</a> with you, you can use the A1638 as a sort of intermediary, charging it with whatever wall adapter you have while charging your smartphone with the power bank for faster speeds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="2sEy9oiCFSRgz8frqjNZSc" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1638-3" alt="The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) charging a Motorola Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2sEy9oiCFSRgz8frqjNZSc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to charging both power banks themselves, that will take significantly longer, given their capacities and the fact that they top out at 30W input. The A1638 takes a bit longer to reach a full charge, taking just under two hours to go from 0% to 100%, while the older A1259 model takes only an hour and a half.</p><p>However, this could once again be a result of reduced capacity thanks to two years of usage, but it is a significant difference. That said, I feel it hardly matters when these are used as backups; therefore, I can leave them to charge overnight and not have to worry about charging them again until they're depleted.</p><h2 id="check-your-charge-2">Check your charge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3933px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HdpUENYJuLKF3xEV88uPPb" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1638-5" alt="The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) displaying battery health" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HdpUENYJuLKF3xEV88uPPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3933" height="2212" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The older model came with a handy display that showed how much time you had left to charge.

It displays the port you're using and the amount of charge it's providing (or receiving) in real-time, allowing you to observe how it fluctuates as you charge a device for an extended period.</p><p>You can also cycle through different screens to view the battery health of the power bank, the number of charging cycles it has undergone, and its battery temperature/charging performance. Anker says its ActiveShield safety system conducts 6 million daily temperature checks "to prevent overheating and extend battery life."</p><p>Given how long I've owned the A1259 model, I believe that additional display information would be helpful in assessing its performance over the years.</p><h2 id="both-are-great-2">Both are great</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tBaBVo3QmyREUhX3KPXjJc" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1638-and-A1259-3" alt="The Anker Nano Power Bank A1638 and A1259" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tBaBVo3QmyREUhX3KPXjJc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're looking for a portable charger and your phone doesn't support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2 magnetic charging</a>, then you can't go wrong with the Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638).

If your phone supports faster charging speeds, this is one of the better options to take advantage of those speeds.</p><p>That said, the older Anker Nano Power Bank (A1259) remains a great choice, as it offers the same battery capacity, a built-in USB-C cable, and a display to monitor your charging progress.

You can also wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> to see if their prices will dip further, but if you're going to buy something during holiday sales, either of these chargers should be on your list.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What are the main differences between the Anker Nano A1259 and A1638 power banks?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The A1259 power bank has a slimmer design, while the A1638 is shorter and bulkier.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nothing's sub-brand CMF makes affordable tech products with a twist, and it recently released its first pair of over-ear headphones, the CMF Headphone Pro. It follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Nothing Headphone 1</a> launch earlier this year, but with a subdued design and a much lower price tag. The CMF Headphone Pro retails for just $99, and its latest sale knocks down the price to just $84.</p><p>I tend to consider the sweet spot in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">over-ear headphone</a> pricing to be around $300, which is what Nothing's mainline headphones cost. I lowered my expectations for Headphone Pro accordingly, but as I started testing them, I quickly realized they come with far fewer compromises than their competitors. They also align perfectly with Nothing's ethos, thanks to a thoughtful design and tactile controls, physical ports, and modularity.</p><p>Switching from pricier cans like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-one-feature-convinced-me-to-use-the-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-gen-2-instead-of-sonys-wh-1000xm6">Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2</a> and buds like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a>, I was surprised to discover how easy the CMF Headphone Pro could become my daily driver.</p><h2 id="cmf-headphone-pro-have-a-comfortable-design-with-tactile-input-2">CMF Headphone Pro have a comfortable design with tactile input</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="imJNjv46wtgqtrXZuUyFW9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-6" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imJNjv46wtgqtrXZuUyFW9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing is all about design, whether we're looking at mainline products or CMF variants. The CMF Headphone Pro sport a glossy plastic finish with a metal slider that helps adjust the headband. That glossy plastic material will look better on some colorways than others — I tested the light green model that ends up looking like teal or blue — but I think it works on Headphone Pro. It's iPod plastic, not cheap plastic.</p><p>The ear cushions and headband are both soft, and the former are interchangeable with a twist-lock system. You need to buy the replacements separately, though. There is a gap between the headphone chassis and the cushions that makes Headphone Pro feel slightly unfinished, and could cause confusion while changing styles.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LoVf4G65kYPDAvWVdH8zS9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-8" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LoVf4G65kYPDAvWVdH8zS9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In typical Nothing fashion, there are plenty of ports and buttons here — a USB-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack, two buttons, a slider, and a roller. The Energy Slider is essentially an on-headphone EQ that can adjust bass or treble intensity in real time. While the Nothing X is great for customization, it is a nice touch that you can tweak your sound signature without the app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nJ2zbQSYLorkG5tGuxX8a9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-9" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nJ2zbQSYLorkG5tGuxX8a9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most of the controls you'll use most are within the "multi-function roller," which handles volume, ANC modes, and playback controls. Would dedicated buttons for each have been better than the EQ slider? Probably, but to CMF's credit, the roller works well. It's more reliable and useful than the capacitive controls shipped on premium headphones I've tested.</p><h2 id="sound-quality-is-superb-for-the-price-i-could-use-them-daily-2">Sound quality is superb for the price — I could use them daily </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ipcwwuEgbN7WqJEtPmvBX9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-3" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipcwwuEgbN7WqJEtPmvBX9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I think of sound quality for sub-$100 headphones, a tinny profile without clear separation or booming bass comes to mind. The CMF Headphone Pro couldn't do more to dispel that image if it tried. The headphones have 40mm drivers equipped with nickel-plated diaphragms that Nothing says reduce distortion and add clarity. They're paired with a 16.5 mm copper voice coil, precision bass duct, and dual-chamber design, according to the company.</p><p>The hardware creates a sound signature that's more balanced than what I've come to expect from Nothing. The bass is certainly present, but it's not overwhelming like Headphone 1 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-3-review">Ear 3</a>. Sounds in the middle or high frequencies may not be as crisp as on pricier headphones, although they are crucially not piercing or overly bright.</p><p>The best way I could describe the Headphone Pro's sound is by reinforcing that I have all the top wireless headphones around, and I switched to CMF's $100 pair with no problem. Sure, I'd take the superior sound quality and ANC of more expensive models, but I didn't feel like I was missing out by using Headphone Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QJnKqgPiRoEkxxT3v73Cb9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-4" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QJnKqgPiRoEkxxT3v73Cb9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With LDAC support up to 990 kbps over Bluetooth, these headphones do support high-res audio. There's also a feature that builds a Personal Sound profile specific to your ears, based on the way you hear individual audio frequencies.</p><p>CMF's Headphone Pro also support "Hybrid Adaptive ANC" with three levels of active noise-canceling intensity. ANC is pretty good for the price, dampening external noise and making it imperceptible when your music is above 75% volume. Transparency mode is less helpful, as voices aren't as clear as I'd like. Still, you can get through a quick conversation with transparency mode on — but only with the music off.</p><p>Battery life is perhaps most impressive of all, hitting the 100-hour mark with ANC off. It drops to half that with ANC on, but 50 hours is decent in its own right.</p><h2 id="are-the-cmf-headphone-pro-headphones-worth-it-2">Are the CMF Headphone Pro headphones worth it?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XuLo5zoujvtiL27h9epgc9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-2" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XuLo5zoujvtiL27h9epgc9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who loves superb sound quality (and is willing to pay for it), I'll never fault anyone for wanting to spend on better audio. However, the CMF Headphone Pro do cover the basics, and at $100, offer a baseline set of features that are all most people need. Decent sound quality, ANC, Spatial Audio, Hi-Res Audio, long battery life, and a headphone jack — the necessities are here.</p><p>I've tested headphones cheaper than the CMF Headphone Pro, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/its-your-last-day-to-get-bluetooth-over-ear-headphones-with-anc-and-hi-res-audio-for-usd55">OneOdio Focus A6</a>,  and many pricier ones. For those on a tight budget, Headphone Pro finds the perfect balance. There is room for improvement, but no major compromises or dealbreakers. That's hard to find in a sub-$100 pair of over-ear ANC headphones.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3c98779d-6889-49ae-b6fa-54976c941c09">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Headphone-Canceling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0FLK83CMY/" data-model-name="Headphone Pro" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nar4CX7iXBX559gBKAvKu9.jpg' alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in light green."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>CMF</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Headphone Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best on a budget</strong></em></p><p>CMF Headphone Pro will impress budget buyers with a comfortable and colorful design, solid sound quality and ANC, and long battery life.

Don't worry, there is plenty of that later.</p><p>Disney and Google need to renegotiate the contract to carry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney's streaming media</a> channels on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a>.

I'm not even allowed to decide where to eat when the wife and I go out with friends. However, it is my job to monitor what Google does, compare it to what it says, and play the game of trying to make sense of it all. Here's what I see.</p><p>Google aims to generate more revenue by hosting Disney's content. It won't likely carry any savings on to the subscriber, and it will all go in the vault somewhere (Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-december-2024-price-hike-reported">passes "rising content costs" to the consumer</a>).</p><p>Disney wants to generate more revenue from selling its streaming content and knows "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calls-the-us-department-of-justices-antitrust-remedies-extreme">market abuse</a>" is a hot term to throw out whenever Google is involved. That's Google's own fault for not being good enough to get away with it, I guess.</p><p>My tip of the week — guaranteed lock, bet the whole damn farm — is that neither company has any interest in making your monthly bill any cheaper.</p><p>Maybe I'm too cynical, but from what I can see, it's always that way. How much better are things for you now that Tim Sweeny and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-total-victory-doesnt-mean-as-much-as-it-wants-you-to-think">Epic had a big win</a>? Did prices go down? Are lions lying with lambs?</p><p>The same can be said about every fight, courtroom or otherwise, between companies that spend more on toilet paper every year than we'll ever earn. That's because we're simply the pawns in their game.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t6tgdBJLw25pPcYrbHJahS" name="Gemini_Generated_Image_h1dd9wh1dd9wh1dd" alt="An AI generated image of a chessboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t6tgdBJLw25pPcYrbHJahS.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The pawn is important in a chess match because there are so many of them that they become expendable assets. You can sacrifice a few if it helps you get closer to your goal.</p><p>Google and Disney love knowing that around 10 million people watch Disney content on YouTube TV, but they would be just as happy if the same amount of money were spread among just 9 million people. The money is what's important, not each subscriber.</p><p>I say things like this a lot, and people often think I'm some sort of lunatic communist who is one more magic mushroom away from screaming anarchy and burning things down. Now that sounds kind of cool, but it's not entirely true; I'm okay with knowing that this is how big business works.</p><p>People invest with the notion that they will earn from it, and the business world turns. I just want them all to admit to it; Google and Disney aren't charities or humanitarian when it comes to streaming football games or princess movies, after all.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="isjGcKtXArcr87cxJ9vkua" name="YouTube-TV-Disney-Plus-apps" alt="YouTube TV and Disney Plus apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/isjGcKtXArcr87cxJ9vkua.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's our responsibility to remember this.

Money. Disney would never give us another Star Wars movie or send a Nat Geo team to film something amazing if it thought it wouldn't make a ton of cash.

One thing to note is that the patch is arriving first for users in India. Users in other regions, like the U.S. and Europe, should start seeing it next week, if not a couple more weeks into November (not unusual). For those in India, the company states the patch bears firmware vCPH2573_16.0.0.201(EX01).</p><p>The changelog is massive, as is an update of this caliber. We'll highlight some of the major talking points, but the remainder of the changelog can be viewed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1987323204254826498#:~:text=IN%3A%20CPH2573_16.0.0.201(EX01)-,Changelog,-Fast%20%26%20Smooth">via the community forum</a>.</p><p>A major change OnePlus 12 owners are in for is a much smoother OS experience. The post states that "apps now display animations that begin and end at intuitive places." Moreover, dragging and dropping UI elements to different spots on your phone should be much smoother/fluid. To make this happen, OnePlus states OxygenOS 16 introduces the Trinity Engine, which "optimizes workload and resources on the fly, maintaining smooth performance across videos, gaming, and extended camera use."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/mind-space-app-in-oxygenos-16-bridges-oneplus-ai-with-gemini-for-inspiration">Mind Space</a> is another big feature getting some new goodies in OxygenOS 16. OnePlus says users will find the Mind Assistant on its homepage, capable of getting you to your saved content quicker. The OnePlus 12's camera is getting some TLC, as it introduces motion photos through Master mode.

The tipster claims that Samsung has started testing some "early firmware" for the Galaxy S27 Ultra, which reportedly directly cites "Polar ID v1.0." The tipster's X post states they came across this mention within the software's early biometric security framework.</p><p>Nothing's confirmed (as there's nothing to see specifically); however, the tipster's discovery leveraged some early details, such as this potentially becoming "full-face authentication."</p><p>The company's software suggests that this new software could reduce unlock latency severely, while also improving its "spoof-resistance." It also appears that Samsung is working on a new "ISOCELL Vizion" camera sensor to make this possible on its future Galaxy phone, if/when this happens.</p><h2 id="not-even-2026-and-we-re-looking-at-2027-2">Not even 2026 and we're looking at 2027</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: Early test firmware for the Galaxy S27 Ultra references something called “Polar ID v1.0” under the biometric security framework.

Rumors claim the S26 Ultra could feature a 6.89-inch M14 OLED display that might hide its contents for added privacy. A dive into One UI 8.5. suggests Samsung's working on a privacy feature that could limit how much of your display is visible to prying eyes around you (notably from the side).</p><p>There are some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protectors">third-party privacy screen protectors</a> that do this for the Galaxy, but Samsung seems interested in making it a part of the device, instead.</p><p>Other S26 Ultra-related rumors claim Samsung could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-ultra-s-pen-might-ditch-the-boxy-look-for-softer-curves">make changes to its S Pen</a> by making it softer, not boxy.

Ultra-fast charging phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> charge up to 100W with the brick included in the box, while most phones from Google and Samsung don't realistically charge faster than 45W for more than a few minutes, even with a special charger.</p><p>That's led to many people believing that Apple, Google, and Samsung have kept charging slower to prolong battery health over time. One YouTuber was tired of the baseless debate and decided to put 40 phones to a series of three tests over a 2-year time span, and he came away with one conclusion: "charge however you like."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kLS5Cg_yNdM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Check out the video for specific stats, but the gist is this: fast charging does not negatively affect battery life in any measurable way. The automated testbed he created charged phones up then drained them again for over 500 cycles. The main test took over 6 months to get all phones to this 500 cycle mark, while the other two tests were mostly inconclusive due to testing issues.</p><p>HTX found that Android phones using 120W charging only showed an average of 0.3% difference in battery health compared to the 18W charging by the end of this 500 cycle test. In other words, it's far more convenient to fast charge your phone than to worry about a fraction of a percentage of battery health loss over time.</p><p>A second series of tests aimed to prove whether or not keeping your phone between 30-80% could improve battery health over time. The results showed a 2.5% difference in battery health between phones that were regularly charged to 100% and drained to 0% battery compared with phones kept in the 30-80% range, giving the latter the edge.</p><p>Of course, purposefully limiting your phone's battery capacity <em>to 50%</em> doesn't seem to make much sense if you're only saving 2.5% battery health over the course of 2 years. Once again, HTX's statement rings true: just use the phone as you'd like. It doesn't really make a difference.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Users arriving at a restaurant can open Lens and ask about the establishment.

While the images shown at the Summit in South Korea gave us a glimpse of the trifold from afar, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDAeAOK0Loc" target="_blank">new video</a> has emerged, offering a closer and more detailed look at the phone. In the video, the presenter goes over the various visible phone specs.</p><p>Regarding the display, the tri-fold could have a 6.5-inch display, similar to a regular smartphone; however, when unfolded, it will feature a 10-inch display. The video also reveals that the display's bezels appear thick, which could limit usable screen space.</p><p>You can also see that the camera placement of the trifold is similar to that of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, as the lenses are placed vertically on an elevated camera bump with the flash off to the side. This suggests Samsung could be maintaining a consistent design across its upcoming product line.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

The search giant has teamed up with Reliance Intelligence, and is just giving away an 18-month subscription of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro</a> plan to all Jio customers. Jio is India's second-largest carrier, and it has over 500 million subscribers as of writing; and yes, all eligible customers get the AI Pro plan without having to pay anything.</p><p>Obviously, as deals go, this is quite good. All you need to do is have a Jio connection to claim the offer. The deal was initially limited to 18 - 25 year-old users, and it is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/partnering-with-reliance-to-bring-the-best-of-google-ai-to-more-people-across-india/">rolling out to all Jio customers</a> in India. Google did a similar deal in the past where it gave away its AI services to college students, and what's notable this time is that it isn't just targeted at students.</p><p>The Google AI Pro plan includes 2TB of storage as standard, and comes with full access to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model. You also get the Veo 3.1 AI video generator utility, Nano Banana AI image-editing tool, and the AI-based NotebookLLM research tool. Now, if you're not a Jio user, the best way to get in on the action is to buy a new SIM — this is what I just did.</p><p>When it comes to eligibility, you'll just need to have a valid Jio SIM card, and an active 5G plan that costs at least ₹349 ($4) a month or more — that's all. If you're an eligible Jio user, you can just head on over to the MyJio app and claim the offer, and get 18 months of Google AI Pro. The plan costs ₹1,950 ($22) a month in the country, so you're getting ₹35,100 ($396) worth of storage and AI credits without paying anything.</p><p>Google isn't the only one giving away AI tools in India; the country's largest carrier Airtel is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.airtel.in/perplexity-pro/">giving away one year of Perplexity Pro</a> to all customers. Regardless of what carrier you use in India, there's a good chance of getting the latest AI models without shelling out any cash. And while I'm ambivalent towards AI in general, I'll admit that Google's AI Pro plan has quite the feature-set, and I've been using Gemini regularly over the course of the last year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This means that, since new Samsung phones usually hit store shelves about two weeks after their unveiling, we can expect that the Galaxy S26 series will finally be available for purchase around March 12th or 13th.</p><p>Along with the Galaxy S26 Plus and S26 Ultra, the base model Galaxy S26 (which might be renamed the Galaxy S26 Pro), is expected to come equipped with a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, some meaningful camera upgrades, and all of the latest AI software tricks.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-lockscreen-widgets-neon" alt="A Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with a widget-covered lockscreen on a rainy neon-soaked street" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't know a lot about the flagship phones yet, so comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-vs-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S26 vs Galaxy S25</a> is a bit tricky, but suffice to say that the S26 devices are expected to be slimmer, faster, and more feature-packed than their predecessors. They're also expected to be a bit more expensive, starting around $899 for the base model and going up to around $1,400 for the S26 Ultra.</p><p>Will the improvements justify the price hike? It's tough to say, but it wouldn't be unreasonable for someone to buy the tried-and-tested Samsung Galaxy S25 instead of the newer model, especially if you can get a good price. Speaking of which..</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Samsung Galaxy S25 get cheaper?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-6" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>So will the Samsung Galaxy S25 get a price drop when the S26 arrives?</strong> Not exactly.</p><p>Although it does happen on occasion, it's pretty unusual for flagship phones to get a permanent price decrease when they reach last-gen status. It's <em>more</em> likely that they'll get discounted once their successors are released, but it's just as possible that the S25 will simply run out of stock once the S26 arrives. Think about it this way: how often do you see a discounted Galaxy S24 that isn't refurbished? Sure, it happens (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced/dp/B0D7HWJDQM"><strong>Google Pixel 9 is 38% off</strong></a> today, for instance), but it's not as common as you might think.</p><p>On the bright side, price tracking data indicates that devices tend to get the cheapest <em>right before</em> the next generation arrives. And with Black Friday sales just around the corner, you can fully expect the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra to receive some record-smashing discounts in the coming weeks. For a little context, the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DP3FNTRP"><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 dropped to $699.99</strong></a> during last month's October Prime Day sale event. With the arrival of the S26 series swiftly approaching, I'd expect Black Friday to knock the phone to the same price or even lower.</p><p>In conclusion, if you want to buy a Samsung Galaxy S25 now that the S26 is approaching, I wouldn't wait for the new phones to drop - <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday 2025</a> might be the answer.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="bbb94515-fae5-41c4-ba8e-cb981c906ca6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9GUjxWjwvBNCNBC552HKi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The flagship sails on</strong></em></p><p>Although its soon to be supplanted by a newer model, the Galaxy S25 continues to be an outstanding flagship phone, packing premium Snapdragon hardware and AI smarts into a sleek, compact frame. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d5980597-b561-487c-914f-08e0d131c1f0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best of Android (for now)</strong></em></p><p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is the base model S25's souped up big sibling, coming complete with a gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED display, incredible cameras, and a built-in stylus pen.

A key Google Messages feature allows users to pin conversations to the top of their inbox for easy access. This can come in handy if you have a contact you message often, or are saving a chat to respond to later. However, the Google Messages app previously only let users pin 10 chats at a time.</p><p>Now, Google Messages will let Android users pin up to 20 conversations at once. The change was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-20-pinned-conversations-3613658/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> while testing a beta version of the Google Messages app. Android Central confirmed the expanded pin limit is available in version <strong>messages.android_20251103_00_RC00</strong> of the Google Messages beta, and it appears to have made its way to the public version of the app as well.</p><p>It's unlikely many users were running into the ten-chat limit for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> pins very often. Depending on your device and its screen size, Google Messages can fit anywhere between eight and ten conversations on the inbox view at a time. With the expanded 20-pin limit, users will need to scroll through two pages of pinned chats to get to their newest conversations — assuming they max out the number of pins.</p><p>Google Messages started out only supporting three pinned conversations at a time. Then, it subsequently expanded the limit to five and ten pinned chats. After doubling the limit twice, Google Messages can now handle 20 pinned conversations.</p><h2 id="how-to-pin-chats-in-google-messages-2">How to pin chats in Google Messages</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AhnPQzMsnENqgC4TinR4Wi" name="Google-Messages-Pinned-Conversations" alt="The pinned conversation limit showing in Google Messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhnPQzMsnENqgC4TinR4Wi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pinning conversations in Google Messages is simple.

Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1oqtrnc/comment/nnl8a7n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">report says</a>, "Mine was also broken, seems to be Adblock related, as the site loads fine without it, and completely breaks with it.

If they're persisting for you, and you're using the Opera GX browser, try the solutions some users have suggested on Reddit. Perhaps that'll fix things, but it's not like users with ad block on YouTube haven't had their fair share of issues.</p><p>There was a problem earlier this summer with users and ad blockers, where reports claimed YouTube was "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-throttling-your-videos-anti-adblock-crusade-continues">slowing down</a>" their videos. The platform called an audible, opting to reportedly throttle or slow down videos for those using ad blockers. Reports said the platform would delay videos and also try to send folks to a Google support page, as if it were a different issue. Of course, the support page suggested removing any extensions (like ad block).</p><p>YouTube's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-global-efforts-clock-ad-blockers">in this war against ad blockers</a> for a few years now, and it's tried all manner of methods. One of the most forward-facing attempts by the platform was its trial of just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-blocks-third-party-ad-blockers">halting all video streaming</a> unless you disabled the blocker or got YouTube Premium.</p><p>YouTube's already going through enough problems right now, as users are growing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-subscribers-have-had-enough-as-report-claims-users-want-out">incredibly frustrated with its TV streaming side</a>. Recent reports claim that users are already thinking about ditching the service, considering they're missing out on the channels Disney provides, such as ESPN and ABC. Additionally, a substantial number of users reportedly surveyed state that if this continues, they will leave and find other avenues.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Not because of its power, but because it struck the perfect balance between price and performance. The Steam Deck released with a $399 price tag, which was $300 less than the original AYANEO Windows handheld, and $250 cheaper than the ROG Ally that arrived in 2023. In the nearly four years since then, the gaming handheld landscape has undergone significant changes.</p><p>The price of x86 handhelds just continues to climb, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/gpdhk/gpd-win-5-the-ultimate-external-battery-handheld">GPD Win 5</a> arriving on Kickstarter, starting at ~$1450 and topping out at ~$2120.

Until now, the most powerful chip available in a handheld device was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds" target="_blank">Snapdragon G3 Gen 3</a>, which is essentially a modified version of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 from last year.</p><p>That's not even the best part, as not only are we getting the 8 Elite in dedicated handhelds, but both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/im-shocked-at-how-cheap-this-premium-android-gaming-handheld-is">KONKR Pocket FIT</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-3-is-the-first-snapdragon-8-elite-handheld-starting-at-just-usd299">AYN Odin 3</a> start for less than $300.

Not so fast. Sure, you won't be able to play the latest AAA games like Battlefield 6 or Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. However, you might be surprised at the different kinds of games that you are capable of playing, and I'm not talking about digging through the slop in the Play Store.</p><p>That's right, I'm talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-retro-gaming-and-emulation-community-needs-to-take-a-deep-breath">Winlator</a> again, and its never-ending list of forks. As a quick debrief, Winlator brings Windows emulation to Android. Over the past year, it has evolved from being an overly complicated emulator for the most dedicated of enthusiasts to offering significantly more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uRe42W4eMJYigHJzaUzheY" name="hollow-knight-silksong-winlator-pixel-10-pro-fold" alt="Hollow Knight: Silksong via Winlator on Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uRe42W4eMJYigHJzaUzheY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One such example, and arguably one of the most popular options currently in the community, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gamehub.xiaoji.com/">GameSir GameHub</a>. I've written about it a few times, but this takes Winlator, puts it in a user-friendly wrapper, and lets you download compatible games right from your Steam library. Recently, I was able to go from installing GameHub to running Hollow Knight: Silksong within 15-20 minutes, without fiddling with any settings besides signing into my Steam account.</p><p>Some of that speed can also be attributed to GameHub's ability to identify the device you're using and the game you're trying to play, and automatically apply settings known to work. Whereas, if you were to fire up Winlator, you'll probably be spending quite a bit of time trying to find the right settings, only for the game to not load or work properly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="psjqgjqyuGdy28cK8JHF8K" name="rocknix-odin-2-portal-ayaneo-pocket-evo-2" alt="ROCKNIX booting on the AYN Odin 2 Portal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psjqgjqyuGdy28cK8JHF8K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Plus, we already know that the Snapdragon 8 Elite is more than capable of emulating other consoles, including Switch games. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-cant-believe-it-theres-actually-a-switch-emulator-on-the-play-store">Eden</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://citron-emu.org/">Citron</a> have both recently released major updates to their respective emulators, introducing better performance and compatibility.

We just have to hope that development continues to flourish, uninterrupted.</p><p>With all of that in mind, how did I manage to perform the mental gymnastics of comparing these two Android-based handhelds to the Steam Deck, an x86 handheld? It's actually quite simple. Both AYANEO and AYN are releasing handhelds that look to offer the same price-to-performance ratio that the Steam Deck still does to this day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v8nToka5jbpAdGZAY2zY5C" name="retroid-pocket-g2-colors" alt="Retroid Pocket G2 Color Options render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8nToka5jbpAdGZAY2zY5C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You could even toss the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/retroid-just-announced-the-pocket-6-but-the-community-wanted-something-different-and-thats-exactly-what-it-got">Retroid Pocket G2</a> into the mix, with its Snapdragon G2 Gen 2, offering excellent emulation and gaming performance for around $200. Ultimately, the point is that the Steam Deck revolutionized the x86 handheld space by lowering the price barrier, and now AYANEO, AYN, and Retroid are doing the same.</p><p>You can always fall back on using the phone or tablet you already own to play games on the go.

Now, while this number seems high, the post notes that Drive Research is a market research firm that polled 1,100 U.S. consumers with a YouTube TV subscription.</p><p>This 82% are "likely" to cancel; however, 24% of those surveyed claim that they have "already cancelled" or are at least "planning to" at some point.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, as noted in the firm's research, people have subscribed to YouTube TV to obtain the content they want to see (channels from Disney).

So when you see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/are-garmin-watches-like-fenix-8-pro-getting-too-expensive">how expensive new Garmin watches</a> are getting, a years-old Garmin at a steep discount will look mighty tempting. Since Garmin likes to clear out old stock during Black Friday, it's worth deciding now whether a last-gen Garmin watch is right for you, or if newer is better.</p><p>I've covered Garmin watch deals for years, and I always have to weigh whether I should recommend deals on models like the Forerunner 55 or 745 that are years out of date and have noticeable flaws, but let you buy into the Garmin ecosystem for $150 instead of $500.</p><p>Then you have Garmin's old flagships. Right now, you can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-fenix-7x-sapphire-solar-gps-smartwatch-51-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-carbon-gray-dlc-titanium-2022/JXF9YFWZXX"><strong>Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar for $599 ($300 off)</strong> </a>or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Multisport-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability/dp/B0BYFCW2GR"><strong>7X Pro Sapphire Solar for $659 ($340 off</strong></a>). You're spending half as much as a $1,300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-vs-fenix-8">Fenix 8 Pro</a>, with flagship-level specs and battery life. But if you're planning to make your watch last for years, can you live without the quality-of-life improvements Garmin has introduced recently?</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e5c584f5-a0c5-4f47-ac51-1b1adda120a2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features." data-dimension48="With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features." data-dimension25="$599.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-fenix-7x-sapphire-solar-gps-smartwatch-51-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-carbon-gray-dlc-titanium-2022/JXF9YFWZXX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:817px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.55%;"><img id="amkHwd84SVifpoLX8GNPsg" name="garmin-fenix-7x-solar-watch-render-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/amkHwd84SVifpoLX8GNPsg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="817" height="846" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-fenix-7x-sapphire-solar-gps-smartwatch-51-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-carbon-gray-dlc-titanium-2022/JXF9YFWZXX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e5c584f5-a0c5-4f47-ac51-1b1adda120a2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features." data-dimension48="With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features." data-dimension25="$599.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Garmin's most recent generation has focused on what I'd call "mainstream" upgrades. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> added an AMOLED display, ECG and skin temperature data, and a mic & speaker for calls and commands. Those same features trickled down to cheaper Garmin models, along with the flashlight. Eventually, I'd bet that the Fenix 8 Pro's LTE-M and satellite tools will come to more watches, too.</p><p>The question becomes, do you <em>need</em> these? I don't use many of these new features especially often, but I strongly prefer AMOLED to MIP and would have trouble going back. For anyone tempted by smartwatches, you might prefer a much cheaper Vivoactive or Venu to a bulky Fenix 7X that hasn't modernized.</p><p>For people who use their old Garmin watch for basic workout tracking and glancing at notifications, though, splurging on a last-gen Fenix deal is smarter, because you're only paying for the fitness perks you'll care about, not the bells and whistles.</p><h2 id="don-t-let-software-fomo-make-you-pay-extra-2">Don't let software FOMO make you pay extra</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jUNVoitpCtXTVbsvFDP6oX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-voice-assistant" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 showing "Listening" for the new voice assistant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUNVoitpCtXTVbsvFDP6oX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We also have to discuss Garmin's software gatekeeping. Even if Garmin watch hardware has a reputation for lasting years, they do so as closed-circuit artifacts of their time. At a certain point, Garmin locks off the OS and refuses to add any new features that might disrupt the delicate equilibrium.</p><p>Unfortunately, that tends to happen within 1–2 years, even for Garmin's Fenix flagships. There was plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1ihbdr6/garmin_abandoned_fenix_7_pro_after_15_years/">controversy</a> when Garmin stopped giving the Fenix 7 series new features after the Fenix 8 launch; now, anyone buying the Fenix 7X today won't get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running economy</a>, evening reports, Strength or Triathlon Coaching, a rucking mode, or other new features that've impressed me over the last year.</p><p>But that can't be helped! Garmin's strategy is to weaponize FOMO so that you feel tempted to buy the newest model. Then you feel entitled to cutting-edge features, and when they run out, you upgrade again. I guarantee Fenix 8 owners will be complaining about this in 2026, after the Fenix 9 launches.</p><p>Maybe buying an older model that's already cut off from feature updates is a good way to make sure you don't pay attention to shiny new Garmin toys, and remain happy with what you have for longer.</p><h2 id="buying-last-gen-is-fine-focus-more-on-what-you-need-2">Buying last-gen is fine; focus more on what you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WmVVuJaLkpeaxLmnW386XD" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review" alt="The Garmin Venu 4 on a marble surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WmVVuJaLkpeaxLmnW386XD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> are more expensive than ever. Mid-range models like the $550 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-fitness-heart-rate-steps">Venu 4</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> are impressive, but why buy either of them when you can get an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-epix-pro-gen-2-sapphire-edition-47mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-carbon-gray-dlc-titanium-with-black-band-2024/JXF9YF4LFS"><strong>Epix Pro (Gen 2) for $499 ($250 off)</strong></a>? It's a question of whether last year's best features (like offline maps) or 2025's newest upgrades (like doubled AMOLED brightness) are more important to you.</p><p>It's an entirely different discussion if you're looking at lower-end Garmin watches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Venu Sq 2</a> is frequently one of the cheapest models available during deal events, but it's quite limited in several ways. I'd much rather spend slightly more on a <em>new</em> cheap Garmin like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a> (currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-vivoactive-6-gps-smartwatch-42-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-slate-with-black-band-2025/JXF9YF5F9G/sku/10871976">$50 off on Best Buy</a>) than buy a model that will feel obsolete out of the box.</p><p>Otherwise, if you're really tempted by some of the best new Garmin watches, you'll have to be patient. Based on Garmin's typical deals timeline, we probably won't see a Fenix 8 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a> for $300 off until 2027 or 2028.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, ahead of the next major Pixel update, Google has released new Theme Packs on the Play Store.</p><p>Late last month, a tipster on Telegram reported that Google is working on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-leak-says-some-wicked-theme-packs-vip-alerts-pixels-next-month">major November Pixel Drop update</a> that will bring many new features to Pixel smartphones. Features such as "Pixel VIPs," which allow special alerts for your closest contacts, as well as improvements to the Pixel Studio app, are on the way. However, the biggest update is system theming support coming to Pixel devices.</p><p>Many Android devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-17-series-pro-pro-max-launch">Xiaomi 17</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-tested-the-oppo-find-x9-pros-camera-i-cant-believe-how-good-it-is">Oppo's Find X9</a> series, and OnePlus phones have enjoyed theming for a long time. However, Google has stuck to its own Material 3 Expressive design, which draws colors from the phone's wallpaper and applies them across the system. It looks like we're now in for a major revamp as a new Theme Packs app has been spotted on the Play Store (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/05/pixel-theme-packs/">9to5Google</a>).</p><h2 id="google-s-new-theme-packs-hint-at-big-pixel-changes-2">Google's new Theme Packs hint at big Pixel changes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1884px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.92%;"><img id="H9ioDLGsjP9XKH28mWVbnQ" name="pixel-theme-app-screenshots" alt="Screenshots from Theme Packs app's Play Store listing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H9ioDLGsjP9XKH28mWVbnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1884" height="1110" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Play Store)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.pixel.customizationbundle">Play Store listing</a>, these theme packs will allow users to "Personalize your Pixel in one tap." "Instantly unlock a complete refresh that updates your wallpaper, icons, sounds, GIFs, and more with seasonal theme packs," reads the app's description.</p><p>And it's not just the listing, we also have our first look at the first Pixel theme, which is based on the Wicked: For Good! movie. There are three options: For Good, Glinda, and Elphaba. As expected, applying a theme adjusts your Pixel's wallpaper, system colors, sounds, and more throughout.</p><p>The app shows a preview of how your phone will look once applied, with a download button in the top-right corner. From the looks of it, users will be able to choose which parts of a theme to apply — for example, toggling wallpapers, sounds, or icons individually.</p><p>The app is compatible with all Pixel devices from the Pixel 6 up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a>, but it doesn't seem to do much at the moment. It will presumably work only after the November Feature Drop for Pixel devices, which should roll out soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company first previewed the switch around the time of Google I/O, saying that Gemini would arrive on Android Auto  "in the coming months" and "this fall." Now, there are signs that Gemini is finally arriving for your car, and it's rolling out for some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto">Android Auto</a> users as of this week.</p><p>Multiple Android Auto users are seeing Gemini replace Google Assistant in their cars starting late Wednesday, Nov. 5, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1opoieb/got_gemini_tonight/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> (via 9to5Google). It's a server-side update that was spotted on Android Auto versions 15.6 and 15.7, per users in the Reddit thread. Those two Android Auto builds are currently in beta, and it isn't apparent yet whether the server-side rollout is only for beta testers, or if it'll soon expand to public builds.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1opoieb/got_gemini_tonight">Got Gemini tonight</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto">r/AndroidAuto</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Gemini on Android Auto completely replaces <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistan</a>t, but it keeps support for the "Hey Google" wake word. Key upgrades that come with Gemini for Android Auto include better natural-language understanding and Gemini Live support. With the latter, users can have a fluid conversation in real-time with Gemini Live while driving. The Gemini interface lives either at the bottom or side of the Android Auto view, depending on the car's screen size and aspect ratio.</p><p>Android Auto users also get Gemini's expanded integration with Google apps and services, like Home for smart home management, Keep for quick notes, Maps for directions, and more. Just this week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps/google-maps-gets-a-gemini-boost-to-help-you-navigate-the-roads-like-a-pro">Google brought Gemini to Google Maps</a> to give smarter directions based on AI and Google Lens analysis.</p><p>Gemini will be able to translate text messages in Android Auto in over 40 languages, and you can edit a translated message's content without having to completely start the command over.</p><h2 id="what-it-s-like-to-use-android-auto-and-gemini-together-2">What it's like to use Android Auto and Gemini together</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9" name="Android-Auto-Gemini-Live" alt="Gemini Live and Google Maps on Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Central <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/i-tried-a-google-built-in-car-and-its-a-sneak-peek-at-gemini-on-android-auto">tested Gemini in Android Auto at Google I/O 2025</a> earlier this year. Compared to Google Assistant, Gemini handles complicated requests better and is great at deciphering multiple follow-ups. For example, Gemini users can start a navigation session with Android Auto while also asking what time a restaurant closes and how far it is from the nearest gas station — all with their voice.</p><p>Like other Gemini versions, Gemini for Android Auto understands and remembers things with personal context, like knowing to always text a particular context in Spanish.</p><p>Android Auto is supported by 250 million cars, and they'll soon get an AI boost with Gemini. The AI-powered digital assistant is already rolling out now for some Android Auto users, with wider availability expected to follow.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Aside from customizing the topic, difficulty, or size of the flashcards or quiz, these can be guided in a particular direction with a text prompt. After a flashcard set or quiz is generated in the Studio tab of the NotebookLM app, a full-screen UI appears, similar to other study apps like Quizlet.</p><h2 id="everything-you-can-do-with-study-tools-in-notebooklm-2">Everything you can do with study tools in NotebookLM</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="npu4ARaczaXZ3YqUsGah6L" name="Notebook-LM-Quiz" alt="Flashcard and quiz support in the NotebookLM." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npu4ARaczaXZ3YqUsGah6L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's everything you can do with flashcards and quizzes in the NotebookLM app for iOS and Android, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-app-quizzes-flashcards/" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p><ul><li>Memorize key terms, important dates and core concepts from your sources with flashcards.</li><li>Test your comprehension and challenge yourself with quizzes.</li><li>Customize the topic, set the difficulty and choose the number of cards or questions.</li><li>Temporarily select and unselect sources while chatting or creating outputs in the Studio tab, so the response is only based on the sources you care about right now.</li></ul><p>Flashcards and quizzes leverage NotebookLM's core research capabilities.

While there have been new additions to this segment, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nuu-b40-5g-hands-on">Nuu B40 5G</a>, which ships with a secondary OLED display on the back that not even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> offer, Samsung and Motorola continue to dominate this space.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and the holiday season approaching, more people are looking to upgrade their phones this fall, and just in time, Motorola has introduced the new Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026. Both smartphones continue to follow budget-friendly traits established previously, while incorporating new features to meet the expectations of users in 2025.</p><p>If you've been wondering about the key differences between these two Moto G smartphones and which one suits you better, let's see how they compare.</p><h2 id="moto-g-2026-vs-moto-g-play-2026-price-color-and-availability-2">Moto G 2026 vs. Moto G Play 2026: Price, color, and availability</h2><p>Motorola unveiled the new Moto G smartphones on November 4, 2025. Similar to the previous Moto G series phones, these models target the budget segment for users seeking the best value for their money.</p><p>The Moto G 2026 is the pricier of the two, starting at $200 in the U.S. It comes with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. There's no higher storage option, but it's available in two beautiful Pantone colors: Slipstream and Cattleya Orchid. The phone isn't available for purchase right away, with sales in North America beginning on December 11, 2025.</p><p>The Moto G Play 2026, on the other hand, is the more affordable of the two and costs just $170. It will be available sooner, starting November 13, 2025, through Motorola's online store, other online retailers, and carrier outlets. The Moto G Play 2026 offers 64GB of onboard storage and, unlike its pricier sibling, comes in only one color: Pantone Tapestry.</p><h2 id="moto-g-2026-vs-moto-g-play-2026-design-and-display-2">Moto G 2026 vs. Moto G Play 2026: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKwAjrcuiW4RbYgzhz3SVU" name="Moto-G-2026-colors" alt="Moto G 2026 colors next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKwAjrcuiW4RbYgzhz3SVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola has settled into a consistent design language for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">budget phones</a>, and the new Moto G models are no exception. Both the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 feature a similar design, characterized by a plain back, a slightly raised camera module that blends seamlessly into the rear panel, and the Motorola 'M' dimple in the center.</p><p>Design-wise, both smartphones appear nearly identical and share the same materials, including an eco-leather back and a plastic frame. They even share the same dimensions of 167.15 x 76.40 x 8.44 mm and weight of 202g. Both phones also have the same button placement with volume rocks and a power button on the right side of the phones, and a USB-C port and a headphone jack at the bottom.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FKxFRxnntbK9FvdqRYFANU" name="Moto-G-2026-display" alt="Moto G 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FKxFRxnntbK9FvdqRYFANU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8000" height="4500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola display showing clouds in the sky)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the camera module may appear to house a triple-camera setup with a flash, the actual camera hardware differs between the two devices, but more on that later.</p><p>Overall, there are a few design differences, except for color options. The Moto G 2026 comes in a vibrant purple hue and a light bluish tone, while the Moto G Play 2026 is available only in a muted blue variant.</p><p>Although the design may seem a little plain and uninspiring, Motorola has prioritized practicality by equipping both phones with an IP52 dust and water resistance rating. While it's no match for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP68 rating</a> found on modern flagships, it's still reassuring to know your phone can handle light rain and splashes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tsEuZLHJKzs7inoNiZ4f5D" name="Moto-G-Play-lifestyle-2-pantone-tapestry" alt="A man using a Moto G Play 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tsEuZLHJKzs7inoNiZ4f5D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4599" height="2587" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moving to the front, both phones are similar here, too.

The chipset is manufactured by TSMC using a 6nm process and is approximately a year old at this point.

The main difference lies in storage: the extra $30 for the Moto G 2026 gets you 128GB of internal storage, while the Moto G Play comes with just 64GB. Both phones support microSD expansion up to 1TB, which should be plenty for most of your apps, photos, games, and videos.</p><p>When it comes to battery life and charging, both models feature a 5,200mAh cell, with Motorola claiming up to two days on a single charge.</p><p>The difference is in charging speed: the Moto G 2026 supports 30W USB-C fast charging, while the Moto G Play caps at 18W.

The official global specs of the 15 shouldn't be too different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-new-oneplus-15-launches-in-china">recently launched China variant</a>, so let's see what a OnePlus 15 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra actually looks like when we break it down.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VWENz9iw98f9eq9JZVi2SF" name="OnePlus-15-official-cameras" alt="The OnePlus 15 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWENz9iw98f9eq9JZVi2SF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2016" height="1134" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first thing you'll notice about the OnePlus 15 is that the camera bump is no longer circular, but rather a square. Its predecessor's design was quite unique, but the 15 resembles the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a> or Oppo's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>. Neither of these phones is officially sold in the North American market, though, which makes the design of the OnePlus 15 stand out.</p><p>For a phone with a massive battery, OnePlus has managed to keep the thickness and weight comparable to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. As before, there's also an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a> for extreme waterproofing.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 also features a relatively large display of 6.78 inches. It features an LTPO AMOLED panel with a staggering 165Hz refresh rate and a pixel-dense screen. The resolution is still a bit lower than what Samsung offers with the S25 Ultra, though this shouldn't really matter with regular use. The peak brightness is also lower, reaching a maximum of 1,800 nits. From what we've seen so far, the phone appears to have extremely thin bezels around the display, which enhances immersion when viewing content.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cs9wTvyCUbuTQbPpCiueCW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-back-01" alt="The back of the silver Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cs9wTvyCUbuTQbPpCiueCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is physically larger than the OnePlus 15, both in thickness and weight. The more angular edges of the phone also make it more cumbersome to handle, especially for those with smaller hands. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-waterproof">IP rating is only IP68</a>, which isn't as comprehensive as the OnePlus 15 IP rating. You do get the S Pen with it, though, which is handy for jotting down notes or signing documents.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a larger 6.9-inch display compared to the OnePlus 15, along with higher brightness of up to 2,600 nits and a denser resolution. One unique feature that's not present on most flagship phones is an anti-reflective coating over the display, which helps reduce glare and reflections significantly.</p><p>In terms of ergonomics and display quality, the OnePlus 15 should have an edge over the S25 Ultra. The gentler curves on the 15 should make it easier to live with, and the incredible refresh rate should come in handy when gaming.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CUufF4F7z4B7gX47VMJkTX" name="pluvia-on-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Pluvia app for Windows emulation on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CUufF4F7z4B7gX47VMJkTX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15 should be the better phone for gaming. This is not just because it features a faster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> chip, but also due to the various software optimizations implemented in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-hands-on">OxygenOS 16</a>. The company is introducing a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-latest-tech-promises-to-enhance-the-android-gaming-experience">Hyper Rendering technology</a>, which is said to improve per-frame rendering efficiency by 80%. This, along with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-latest-tech-promises-to-enhance-the-android-gaming-experience">other on-chip optimizations</a>, positions the 15 as one of the best smartphones for gaming.</p><p>The China variant offers 12GB and 16GB RAM options, as well as storage tiers that range up to 1TB. This could change with the global variant, so we'll have to wait and see what the rest of the world gets.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 boasts a massive battery of 7,300mAh, which significantly outperforms the 5,000mAh capacity of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Charging speeds of the China variant are as follows: 120W wired and 50W wireless. The charging speeds could also differ slightly in the global variant, so we'll know what we're getting soon enough.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 will launch in three colors called Infinite Black, Ultra Violet, and Sand Storm. There's no word on the pricing yet till it officially launches on November 13, but expect to start at around $900, like its predecessor.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 15</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16, (OxygenOS 16)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Infinite Black, Sand Storm, Ultra Violet</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Silver Blue, Titanium Black, Titanium White Silver, Titanium Gray, Titanium Jade Green, Titanium Jet Black, Titanium Pink Gold</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.78 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.9 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,772 x 1,272</p></td><td  ><p>3,120 x 1,440 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>LTPO</p></td><td  ><p>LTPO OLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz (up to 165Hz for gaming)</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB, 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB (not expandable)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB (not expandable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto, 32MP front</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main,<br>50MP ultrawide,<br>10MP telephoto (3x),<br>50MP telephoto (5x),<br>12MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,300mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>161.42 x 76.67 x 8.2 mm (8mm for Sand Storm)</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>211-215 grams</p></td><td  ><p>218 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is not even a year old, which means it still has plenty of life left in it. In fact, Samsung plans on supporting it with OS upgrades and security patches for the next seven years. The custom Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in the Ultra is also plenty powerful for gaming and multitasking. In benchmarks and certain AI tasks, the new Gen 5 in the OnePlus 15 may surpass it, but most users should not notice a significant difference in day-to-day usage.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra can be equipped with up to 1TB of storage and features 12GB of RAM across its variants. The 5,000mAh battery might not be as large as the 15's, but it's nothing to scoff at either. In our testing, we were quite happy with the multi-day battery life it offered. Charging speeds are not the quickest either, but it gets the job done. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">S25 Ultra is Qi2-ready</a>, which means it can do magnetic wireless charging with the help of the right case.</p><p>The S25 Ultra comes in more colors, including some exclusive shades if you buy it via Samsung's website. It still costs over $1,000, though, even with the small price reduction since its debut in January 2025.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cameras-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.82%;"><img id="Uk6LMmYu2uwJdwmBXcWHK8" name="oneplus-15-camera-module-look" alt="First look at the OnePlus 15's back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uk6LMmYu2uwJdwmBXcWHK8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2655" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the years, OnePlus' number series has typically had good primary cameras, but their selfie and secondary cameras have either hit or missed the mark, depending on the generation. With the OnePlus 15, the company ditches the Hasselblad branding in favor of its in-house <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">DetailMax Engine</a>.

Selfies are handled by a 32-megapixel camera. We will be testing the cameras further and have the full report in our review, so watch out for that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FsL3kFtGCYXCS7PahjVswD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-viewfinder-05" alt="Using a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL to take a photo of red flowers up close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FsL3kFtGCYXCS7PahjVswD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung didn't make any major changes to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera system from its predecessor, except for the ultrawide, which now has a 48MP sensor. Our previous issues with the Ultra series, like shutter lag, have also been reduced quite a bit, although there's room for improvement.</p><p>It's still one of the best phones for zoom shots, thanks to the dual telephoto system that allows it to reach a magnification of 100x.

With every SoC iteration, we get better performance and power efficiency, which means it's a little less stress on the battery when doing intensive workloads like gaming or AI processing. Considering how on-device AI workloads on phones are only getting stronger with every passing year, it's nice to know you have the hardware that's capable of doing such tasks efficiently.</p><p>Long-term software support is something where OnePlus still has a lot of catching up to do, and if you plan to hold on to your purchase for more than four years, you would be better off with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Seven years of updates is no joke, and that S Pen can be quite handy at times.</p><p>If you've made up your mind about spending more than $1,000, then I'd also suggest waiting till January 2026 to see what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> offers. It's expected to be much slimmer and lighter while offering the same (and more) features as the current-gen Ultra.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="25c9252a-47d4-4487-97c9-4aaf4003c3d2">            <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/launch/oneplus-15" data-model-name="OnePlus 15" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best for power users</strong></em></p><p>If you're a heavy power user who multitasks, plays intense mobile games, travels, maybe even works outdoors, the OnePlus 15 is an option you should consider.

The feature specifically adds support for JSON Schema, with allows the Gemini API to tap into data validation libraries like Pydantic and Zod. Previously, the Gemini API only support schemas based on the OpenAI 3.0 specification.</p><p>"Structured Outputs enable AI models to generate responses that guarantee adherence to a specific schema, which is important for tasks like data extraction and database population," Google explains in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-api-structured-outputs/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. "They are also important for agent communication: one agent’s output becomes another’s formatted input, enabling complex multi-agent systems to collaborate without translation layers."</p><p>JSON Schema support applies to all Gemini models that are still actively supported by Google, including all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 models</a>. One feature, implicit property ordering, also works with Google's OpenAI compatibility API. In the example code provided by Google below, you'll see the revised Gemini API in action, which keeps an identical order to the ordering of schema keys:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-python" language="python" ><code>from google import genaifrom pydantic import BaseModel, Fieldfrom typing import Union, Literalclass SpamDetails(BaseModel):    """Details for content classified as spam."""    reason: str = Field(description="The reason why the content is considered spam.")    spam_type: Literal["phishing", "scam", "unsolicited promotion", "other"] = Field(description="The type of spam.")class NotSpamDetails(BaseModel):    """Details for content classified as not spam."""    summary: str = Field(description="A brief summary of the content.")    is_safe: bool = Field(description="Whether the content is safe for all audiences.")class ModerationResult(BaseModel):    """The result of content moderation."""    decision: Union[SpamDetails, NotSpamDetails]client = genai.Client()prompt = """Please moderate the following content and provide a decision.Content: 'Congratulations!

Google's answer to that question is simple: agentic AI. Google has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">touting the future of agentic AI</a> for a while now, starting with an appearance at Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event in January 2025 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">continuing at Google I/O</a> in May 2025. There are consumer-facing projects that leverage agentic help, like Agent Mode, and more developer and enterprise tools — like the Gemini API.</p><p>In this case, businesses, schools, and developers can use the Gemini API to create multi-agent workflows for processing data. It ensures that schemas remain consistent across various AI agents and LLMs, which is critical for data processing an extraction. While you might not use structured outputs as the average Android user, you'll certainly encounter software applications that leverage the Gemini API's newest features.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The smartphone represents a significant shift for OnePlus, partly driven by necessity.</p><p>Its camera deal with Hasselblad expired, so the brand pivoted, swapping out the camera sensors and switching to its own processing engine. Elsewhere, the OnePlus 15 features a new boxy design with a square camera bump and a new display with a lower resolution. It's all part of a new positioning for the OnePlus 15 as a gaming and performance-first handset, even if it required a few downgrades to achieve that.</p><p>That will make comparisons between the OnePlus 15 and older models like the OnePlus 12 tricky. Yes, the new model is expectedly to have the edge in overall performance and battery life. In other areas, the situation is different. The OnePlus 12 outperforms the OnePlus 15 in display quality and camera hardware, to start. So, which one should you buy? Let's compare the models to help you determine which one is best for you.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-12-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 12: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1108px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="9rkgtbMwWwGtbknLqAu9SL" name="oneplus-15-china-launch" alt="OnePlus 15 launches in China in three colorways" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9rkgtbMwWwGtbknLqAu9SL.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1108" height="554" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15's design will be inherently controversial. You could identify previous OnePlus phones from afar by their circular rear camera arrangement, curved body, and two-toned finishes. None of these characteristics is present on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-new-oneplus-15-launches-in-china">OnePlus 15</a>. The smartphone features a boxy, rectangular design with flat sides. There's also a squircle rear camera arrangement and pretty bland finish options.</p><p>In fact, it appears to be inspired by last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a>, which we described as "the compact iPhone clone you never wanted." The same may be true of the OnePlus 15, except for the bigger form factor. Many longtime OnePlus fans will be disappointed by the OnePlus 15's new design, which lacks uniqueness. Rounding out the design is a chassis that measures 161.42 x 76.67mm with a thickness of 8.2mm and weighs between 211 and 215 grams.</p><p>The older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is larger and thicker, measuring 9.1mm in thickness and weighing 220 grams, but it retains the fan-favorite OnePlus design language. You get an off-center circular camera bump and a curvy chassis. There are also more striking finish options available, such as Flowy Emerald and Silky Black.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GnPze5fyzHuLY7FMUtPGNY" name="oxygenos-15-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GnPze5fyzHuLY7FMUtPGNY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15's screen is slightly smaller than the OnePlus 12's display, but the difference will be negligible. The newer model's panel measures 6.78 inches, which is only 0.04 inches smaller than the 6.78-inch panel on the older model. The bigger difference will be in display resolution and refresh rate.</p><p>OnePlus aimed to offer a 165Hz refresh rate option on the OnePlus 15 for mobile gaming, which necessitated a reduction in the display's resolution. It has a 2,772 x 2,772 (1.5K) resolution, a downgrade compared to the OnePlus 12's 3,168 x 1,440 resolution display. However, the OnePlus 12 only has a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>OnePlus explained that 165Hz refresh rates aren't possible on a QHD+ display, and it had to choose between one or the other. It went with refresh rates, whereas the OnePlus 12 prioritizes display clarity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QUbzUyTTi9ciup6N6YXABb" name="oxygenos-15-10.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUbzUyTTi9ciup6N6YXABb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15 is superior in durability, with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a> that not only protects against liquid submersion but also high-pressure water jets.

There's also 50W wireless charging support and 100W (80W internationally) fast wired charging support.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-battery-life">OnePlus 15 elevates battery life</a> to the next level with a 7,300mAh silicon-carbon battery, split into two cells. It's a massive 21% capacity increase over the OnePlus 13, and even larger compared to the OnePlus 12. This change is also related to gaming, as the company touts that you can play high-level games for up to 6.6 hours on a single charge at 165 FPS.</p><p>With the OnePlus 15, the dream of true multi-day phone battery life may have arrived.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-12-cameras-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 12: Cameras </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VWENz9iw98f9eq9JZVi2SF" name="OnePlus-15-official-cameras" alt="The OnePlus 15 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWENz9iw98f9eq9JZVi2SF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2016" height="1134" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the camera bump design and dropping the Hasselblad branding, OnePlus also switched out the camera sensors on the OnePlus 15. There is a trio of 50MP sensors that are technically downgrades compared to the OnePlus 13, with even the OnePlus 12 having a better primary camera sensor (on paper). It's worth noting that hardware downgrades don't always result in poorer photo quality, and both Apple and Google made similar moves in 2025.</p><p>Android Central has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-photo-samples" target="_blank">taken 100 photos with the OnePlus 15</a>, and the results are impressive.

It's true that the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 platform doesn't have the same improvements as the newer Elite chips. The OnePlus 12 was ahead of its time regardless. Specs like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> and a 5,400mAh battery capacity still beat some flagships, namely the Google Pixel 10, in 2025.</p><p>The OnePlus 12 is also somewhat outdated in other areas, such as its limited support for IP65 water resistance. If you can look past that, though, there's a lot to like even two years later.</p><p>For everyone else, there's the OnePlus 15. It doesn't have the raw specs of older OnePlus phones, and clearly takes inspiration from the boxy designs of Samsung, Apple, and Google phones. However, let's remember that phones like the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 13 had a tendency to overemphasize specs. In many ways, the OnePlus 15 is a regression to the mean.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 remains an excellent phone, thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor and a 7,300mAh battery capacity, which allows it to do almost anything.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ac59e54d-0046-42ce-91ef-60619bdb0fcc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still outstanding</strong></em></p><p>With the OnePlus 15, the brand decided to go all-in on gaming and overall performance.

Supposedly, Samsung has contacted a supplier for the necessary components, but the purported amount may only be good for ~20,000 to ~30,000 Galaxy Z Trifold units.</p><p>The report adds that Samsung's trifold development will likely continue into December, where the publication's source claims "suppliers are expecting an update."</p><p>However, per its source, suppliers are hesitant to believe that Samsung will make another order for more components to craft more trifolds. Right now, it seems that Samsung is only looking to create an extremely limited number of Galaxy Z Trifolds, but the reason could be due to the market.</p><p>The publication adds that Samsung may start low to evaluate the phone's performance before thinking about more. We've heard something similar to this before, and there's likely another reason for the small amount.</p><h2 id="where-to-go-from-here-2">Where to go from here?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.57%;"><img id="4YTUmzQojfurFJVYsUyJHT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-2" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4YTUmzQojfurFJVYsUyJHT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="354" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just yesterday (Nov 5), we were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/this-could-be-your-best-look-yet-at-samsungs-new-galaxy-z-trifold">treated to the best look</a> we've ever gotten of the Galaxy Z Trifold. In a leaked video, Samsung's device was reportedly on full display, revealing its highly anticipated design. It was stated that the unit in question featured a 6.5-inch folded display, which expands to 10 inches when the phone is fully unfolded. However, it seems as though the phone boasts some pretty thick bezels.</p><p>Overall, its alleged design very closely mirrors the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This is something we've seen rumored previously, and this video only leans more into that possibility. Speaking of the Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">Samsung was scrambling</a> earlier this year to make more, as consumers flocked toward the newest model.</p><p>Samsung was reported to have placed orders to create roughly 260,000 more Fold 7 units in September, a 60,000-unit jump from its original plan.</p><p>This is a stark difference between how it saw the Fold 7, and what's been rumored for the Trifold's low 20,000 to 30,000 (alleged) production plan. There are rumors that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/not-launching-its-trifold-phone-in-the-us-is-the-smart-move-by-samsung">might skip the U.S.</a> when it launches its Trifold, and the reason's pretty simple: pricing. There's speculation that the device could reach upwards of $2,500 in the U.S., and a price point like that would surely make consumers furrow their eyebrows.</p><p>Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand also anticipates that there might be some issues with the Trifold, just on the basis that it will be a first-gen model. Hildenbrand also speculates that Samsung might keep the Trifold in Asian markets just as a test, considering the market is a mix of early adopters and simply curious folk.</p><p>Some rumors claim Samsung will debut the device late in 2025, though others say 2026 is more likely.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Don't feel sorry for me because I did this to myself by being a dumbass, and I didn't die; life is generally good, and it forced me to grow up at 30 years old. I'm not paralyzed, though. As time goes by, severe damage to my bones and nerves is forcing me to live more of my life sitting down, but I can still walk a bit.</p><p>I'm also stubborn. My office is in the basement and I like having it in the basement. I have my "own" bathroom, easy access to the backyard, and it gives me privacy and peace while I'm trying to work. Getting to the basement is a different story because of the stairs. Stairs are my kryptonite, both up and down.</p><p>I only know if my legs are moving if I am looking at them. I can even step on a Lego and feel no pain. Legs that feel "dead" and stairs mean I fall down. A lot. So far, I've not broken anything or knocked myself out, but both my Doctor and my wife know that it could easily happen, and reluctantly, I even have to admit I could end up at the bottom of he steps, out cold and in need of help. I need something that can call for that help if I need it, but I'm not about to wear something marketed for senior citizens. I need a wearable with reliable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-explains-fall-detection">fall detection</a>, like the Pixel Watch 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1278px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="rzj5VNuWbDsjj5ZWgmbNkT" name="Wheelchair-wheels-cropped.jpg" alt="Wheelchair wheels" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzj5VNuWbDsjj5ZWgmbNkT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1278" height="718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know that the Pixel Watch 3 isn't the newest smartwatch from Google or the only wearable that offers fall detection. I also know that Black Friday and its mountain of tech sales are just a few weeks away.</p><p>I also know that if you need something, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-phone-frenzy-buy-now-or-bide-your-time">you should buy it when you see it at the right price</a> and have no regrets. I fell three times last week. I can't wait and don't want to do the smart thing and move my office upstairs.</p><p>I know my situation is different than most, but it's similar in some ways. When we have an immediate need, it's great when we can fill it and save a bunch of money. I'll miss the accuracy and battery life of my Garmin Venu 3, but I'm not going to complain about having a new shiny gadget to mess with.</p><p>And if I take a more serious tumble, I can get the help I need.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The RedMagic 11 Pro recently joined the list, bringing with it something that none of its rivals can offer: liquid cooling. Between the Gen 5's performance gains over last year's model, and RedMagic's focus on mobile gaming, needless to say that the phone will end up generating a bunch of heat.</p><p>Recently, Zack Nelson from JerryRigEverything got his hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic/redmagic-just-dropped-a-gaming-phone-with-a-literal-water-cooler-inside">RedMagic 11 Pro</a>, and put it through his gauntlet of torture tests. Unlike other phones that were recently released, the 11 Pro passed with flying colors. As for the results, the display begins to scratch at a level 6 on the Mohs scale, with "deeper grooves at a level 7."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/826O9YGrGCg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>When holding a lighter to the screen, it took about 20 seconds or so to see that portion of the screen turn white. However, just a few moments later, and the AMOLED display "recovered," and you couldn't even tell where the burn initially occurred.</p><p>Nelson's bend tests are notorious for finding flaws with devices, as we recently saw with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-fold-smokes-up-and-explodes-during-jres-durability-test">Pixel 10 Pro Fold actually exploding</a>. RedMagic fans can rest easy, as the 11 Pro barely even flexed when pressure was applied to both the front and the back.</p><p>Moving onto the star of the show, Zack carefully removed the back glass that covers the entire rear of the phone, and few moments later, the entire liquid cooling loop was exposed. It wasn't until the phone was turned off and the loop was disconnected from the phone that it stopped entirely, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jPCyFKsHWYDqw8Eky4QGof" name="redmagic-11-pro-jre-teardown-screen-burn" alt="Screen burn test on the RedMagic 11 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jPCyFKsHWYDqw8Eky4QGof.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4112" height="2314" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JerryRigEverything)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's worth pointing out that when looking at the liquid cooling, you'll see some bubbles that aren't the same color as the blue liquid. Although we aren't sure as to the reason why this was done, it could just be for aesthetics otherwise the liquid cooling loop would just look blue all of the time.</p><p>Speaking of which, I have to agree with Zack here, as he's not sure why RedMagic didn't just have the majority of the loop shown. It makes the phone even more unique than it already is, and looks pretty darn cool at the same time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3198px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AayYrLzxUG3PpHpyJyHcye" name="redmagic-11-pro-liquid-cooling-teardown-jre-1" alt="Liquid cooling loop teardown on RedMagic 11 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AayYrLzxUG3PpHpyJyHcye.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3198" height="1799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JerryRigEverything)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After finishing the disassembly of the RedMagic 11 Pro, Nelson manages to get everything put back together and turns the phone back on without any issues. While this isn't something that everyone should try to do, it's nice seeing how well-built these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phones</a> really are. And if anything, it provides a bit of reassurance that your phone won't break under a bit of pressure or if you happen to drop it.</p><p>Pre-orders for the RedMagic 11 Pro are slated to kick off on November 13, with the base model priced at $749. For that, you'll get the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.

However, we may have new information about the phone from the source itself. Samsung seems to have teased the Galaxy S26 during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-zuckerberg-predicts-when-ai-glasses-will-be-profitable">recent earnings call,</a> suggesting that it would feature an Exynos AP (mobile application processors) and use improved camera sensors. (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-spec-confirmation-q3-2025-earnings-3611552/">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>During the Q3 earnings call, Daniel Araujo, VP of Samsung’s mobile experience division, said that the Galaxy S26 lineup will “revolutionize the user experience with user-centric, next-gen AI, a second-generation custom AP, and stronger performance, including new camera sensors.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This essentially means that the Galaxy S26 lineup will indeed have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600</a>, which was rumored to be the case at least in some regions, while the rest of the world might see the Snapdragon chipset specifically designed for Galaxy models, like its predecessor. Following up on the chipset question, Araujo said that “for the Galaxy S26, the AP (chipset) evaluation is still underway, so we can’t yet confirm our next year’s flagship lineup.”</p><p>Additionally, Araujo also hinted at possible hardware changes coming to the Galaxy S26 series, giving it new camera sensors this time around. Since the company has stuck to the same rear camera lenses since the Galaxy S22. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26#section-samsung-galaxy-s26-will-get-huge-imaging-upgrades">Previous leaks suggest</a> that the company plans to retain the 200MP HP9 primary camera.</p><p>However, it could also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-spec-confirmation-q3-2025-earnings-3611552/">incorporate a newer sensor</a> for the 3x zoom, which should enhance image quality. Both the primary and 5x cameras are also anticipated to benefit from a faster aperture, meaning better low-light images are in the books.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy S26 Ultra sensors debugged details:200MP HP250MP JN3 ultrawide12MP S5K3LD 3x tele50MP IMX854 peris 5x12MP IMX874 selfieOnly change this time is the traditional 10MP 3x 1/1.39 size sensor is replaced by newer 12MP K3LD.

According to the tipster, Samsung will supposedly use the same rear camera sensors on the S26 Ultra as the S25 Ultra. Only the 3x telephoto lens will get an upgrade to a 12MP S5K3LD sensor. That said, the rumor suggests that it could be the same size as the 10MP sensor, making for little to no change.</p><p>The S26 series is rumored to feature APV codec video recording, offering two modes: APV HQ and APV LQ. APV HQ will consume 1.5GB per minute of video, whereas APV LQ will use 750MB for the same duration.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, it's no surprise that the next range of devices will come packed with Galaxy AI, and as Araujo mentioned, the next-gen AI could be even more intuitive, adapting to the users' needs. As we've seen in multiple leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to heavily leverage AI, as the company is supposedly developing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-5-get-to-the-point-faster-ai-notification-summaries">"Notification Summaries," </a>Privacy display, offering presets for Pro camera controls, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

On its way to "more than 60 markets" globally, Spotify says these stats will be accessible via your <strong>profile icon > listening stats</strong>. What you can expect is a weekly overview of "your top artists and songs from the past four weeks."</p><p>The platform states that aside from reliving what you've been jamming to, your listening stats will also deliver personalized highlights. These highlights will include listening milestones, fan moments, "a new discovery," and what makes your listening unique.</p><p>Though personal, Spotify says your weekly listening stats are shareable, too.</p><p>The entire week's stats or simply a condensed highlight can be shared with others through Spotify or in other apps, like Instagram and WhatsApp. The new Listening Stats will provide playlists inspired by your recent week's listening habits, as well as song suggestions that you might want to check. Users can look at listening stats as a miniature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-your-spotify-2020-wrapped-apple-music-replay-youtube-music-year-review">end-of-the-year Wrapped</a>, which Spotify itself alludes to.</p><p>Still, for those chunkier stats, you'll have to wait for the year's end for that colorful overview.</p><h2 id="stats-for-what-s-been-on-your-mind-2">Stats for what's been on your mind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="9F4k6fxnRwb5hkPJ9F6NQ7" name="spotify-weekly-listening-stats-overview" alt="Spotify's weekly "listening stats" shows the user what songs they've been hearing on repeat, as well as the dates the overview covers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9F4k6fxnRwb5hkPJ9F6NQ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spotify's listening stats should start rolling out to Android devices soon, considering the announcement came late this week.

Getting it there is only half the battle, though, because once you've received it, the way it appears can make all the difference. We've all seen websites that have a different layout or format based on the device you're using (you're on one right now!), but what makes it work? Are you tagged and tracked across the internet so that everyone with a web presence knows whether you're using a phone or a laptop?</p><p>Thankfully, no. It's a complicated process made simple for the people building the browser by placing all the work on the web host, called a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/win7appqual/user-agent-string" target="_blank">User Agent String</a>.</p><p>Every bit of software capable of perusing the contents of a website has a UAS. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whats-your-favorite-web-browser-2020">web browser</a> you are using right now has one, AI content scrapers have one, and even some web browser extensions have one. They offer it to the web page when it's requested, so the web page knows what to send back.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="vQT3SZsmGNc2Vnnuj4gizh" name="Google-Search-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Google Search on HP Chromebase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQT3SZsmGNc2Vnnuj4gizh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/141.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</strong></p><p>That's my own UAS as I'm writing this. You can find yours simply by opening Google Search and asking, "<em>What is my user agent string?"</em> and it will tell you because it asks your browser, and your browser tells it — the same process as any other website.</p><p>This, along with other information like screen dimension, the number of colors your graphics adapter and display can render, and any requested language support (this is also stored and kept ready to send if needed), is what turns a bunch of code into what you see once the browser on your device gets something it can use to create it. Yes, your web browser is building the website from internet addresses and strings of code.</p><p>This sounds awfully confusing, and it certainly can be. That's why the workload is somewhat divided. A web browser installed on a device, regardless of its type, has plenty to do when it receives the raw data to build something coherent out of. However, it must retrieve the correct data, as different browsers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-latest-speedometer-3-test-smashes-old-records" target="_blank">construct web pages in distinct</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-latest-speedometer-3-test-smashes-old-records"> ways</a>.</p><p>A website has plenty to do, ensuring that different versions of the layout, image sizes, colors, and fonts are rendered correctly by your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vp-criticizes-apple-dma-browser-changes" target="_blank">browser's engine</a>, but it must know <em>what</em> to send.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:517px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.03%;"><img id="eVi3m6km8VmWTyMUbKwVCd" name="google-cloud-ai.png" alt="Google Cloud Tensor Processing Units" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVi3m6km8VmWTyMUbKwVCd.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="517" height="300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The process:</p><p>A device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phone in your hand</a> visits a site on the internet by a complex (and a whole different article's worth of complications) series of routing until a connection between your browser and the web server is established.</p><p>The web server queries the browser, asking about the type of device, its capabilities, the display size, and the number of colors the device can render, among other details.</p><p>The web browser has this information readily available in a convenient and persistent manner. It sends a few lines of text back with minimal effort because it's already there, ready to go.</p><p>The web server takes this information and decides what version of the website to send back, and you get to see it.</p><p>Thankfully, the best part of the whole process is the fact that we don't have to do anything. We can click on a link and see what we were hoping to see. It's perfectly safe, has nothing to do with sending any sort of personal information or tracking you across the web, and it honestly does "just work."</p><h2 id="abusing-the-process-2">Abusing the process</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="g4Q8xJWPsVq4ErZUgk9b5P" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-keynote-AI-everywhere" alt="Cristiano Amon on stage with "AI everywhere" behind him" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g4Q8xJWPsVq4ErZUgk9b5P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2900" height="1631" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, this is easily abused by web publishers. I won't tell you how to change the UAS of your device because it's an easy way to break stuff, but it's not hard to do.

This is a small line of text that your web browser (such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) automatically sends to the website/web server with every request.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There have been no new developments in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-is-ready-to-bring-back-abc-and-espn-but-theres-a-catch">this week's feud</a> between YouTube TV and Disney (yet), but while those content providers battle it out at the negotiating table, other companies have been entering the ring with deals of their own. </p><p>Verizon 5G Home Internet just dropped an offer that could be good news for anyone who has been affected by the streaming chaos: sign up for the 5G Home Ultimate plan and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100048248-17161891?sid=hawk-custom-tracking"><strong>you'll get 50% off the Disney Plus Bundle AND your choice between a free Samsung TV, Galaxy Tab S10 FE tablet, or Nintendo Switch</strong></a><strong> </strong>gaming console. That means you're getting Disney Plus, Hulu, and live sports through ESPN Plus (with ads) for only 10 bucks per month. And that's before you even consider the value of the free device. </p><p>As if that wasn't enough, if you bundle your 5G Home Internet with one of Verizon's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">wireless plans</a>, that Disney Bundle perk will actually become 100% free (unless you choose another free perk, of course). As with most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a>, there's a good bit of fine print involved, so let's break it all down. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0d3ad032-b699-4ccc-acd8-46d5eb9a58bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon" data-dimension48="Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon" href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100048248-17161891?sid=hawk-custom-tracking" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bGnN5XZnLzieRfbffhXSLD" name="verizon-2024-logo-sq.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGnN5XZnLzieRfbffhXSLD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="426" height="426" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100048248-17161891?sid=hawk-custom-tracking" data-dimension112="0d3ad032-b699-4ccc-acd8-46d5eb9a58bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label='Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon' data-dimension48='Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon' data-dimension25=""><strong>Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon</strong></a></p><p>Join Verizon 5G Home Internet with the 5G Home Ultimate plan and you'll get to choose between a free QLED Samsung TV, Nintendo Switch gaming console, or the powerful Galaxy Tab S10 FE tablet. </p><p>Verizon 5G Home Internet plans also let you choose between a number of excellent perks for $10 per month, including a popular streaming bundle that consists of Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus. Happy holidays, indeed. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100048248-17161891?sid=hawk-custom-tracking" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="0d3ad032-b699-4ccc-acd8-46d5eb9a58bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon" data-dimension48="Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>For starters, it's important to know what Verizon 5G Home Internet actually <em>is. </em></p><p>Unlike traditional providers that use cable or fiber optic technology to offer fast internet access, Verizon 5G Home Internet utilizes its own ultrawideband cellular network - the same 5G network that you access with your smartphone. The advantage is that 5G Home Internet is affordable, easy to install, and if you live in an area with good 5G coverage, just as fast as traditional broadband. </p><p>Verizon's 5G Home Ultimate plan is the best that the internet provider has to offer, giving customers unlimited premium data, Ultra HD 4K streaming, and a free Wi-Fi extender to cover your entire home. You'll also get a five-year price lock, 30-day money-back guarantee, and no hidden fees or confusing setup costs. </p><p>And of course, like Verizon's best wireless plans, you get to mix and match entertainment perks every month for $10 apiece. These benefits range from unlimited cloud storage to streaming services, including the Disney Plus Bundle. That means you're getting Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus for 50% off its usual cost, so if you're missing out on live sports following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-disney-stalemate-continues-as-neither-side-agrees-to-end-the-blackout">the YouTube TV/Disney Plus fallout</a>, now's your chance to enjoy all of the action for cheap. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1116px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xpaiD26Mm37GnjCSnTdRq3" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-playing-games-lifestyle" alt="Lifestyle image of someone playing games on the Galaxy Tab S10 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xpaiD26Mm37GnjCSnTdRq3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1116" height="628" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, the perks here are nice, but the Verizon 5G Home Internet deal's biggest selling point is the free gift. The options include a 43-inch Samsung Q7F QLED TV (a $399.99 value), a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE</a> tablet ($599.99), or a Nintendo Switch ($339.99). All you need to do is sign up for the aforementioned 5G Home Ultimate plan and use it for six months without missing a payment or cancelling the service.</p><p>Verizon's 5G Home Ultimate plan starts at $85 per month, but you can easily drop the price down to $60 per month by using AutoPay and bundling your internet service with one of Verizon's wireless plans. Members who bundle internet with mobile service will also get a complimentary perk, which means you might get the Disney Plus Bundle for completely free. </p><p>This deal may not be for everyone, but if you live in an area with good 5G access and you're looking to switch internet providers anyway, this is a great way to do it AND get some discounted (or free) entertainment out of the deal. With the holidays swiftly approaching, that's just the kind of break I need. </p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Then we've got the podcast for you! I sat down with 9to5Google's Will Sattelberg this past week to discuss the launch of Android XR, the Galaxy XR, and everything those products mean for the future of XR on the November 3, 2025 edition of The Sideload podcast.</p><p>When Will asked me to be a guest on the show, I knew there was no way I could turn it down. We've been covering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Samsung Galaxy XR</a> in depth at Android Central since before the launch, getting our hands on the elusive headset three times before it went to retail.</p><p>I also write a weekly XR-centric column called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">AC thVRsday</a> that goes live on, you guessed it, Thursdays. If you're not familiar with the term XR, it stands for eXtended Reality and covers the gamut of AR and VR devices. That's everything from smart glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> to full-fledged, premium VR headsets like Samsung's newly launched Galaxy XR.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdLcfdKHUPc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>If you're looking for something specific, Will was kind enough to list out the timestamps for all the major topics:</p><ul><li>00:00:00 – Intro</li><li>00:01:02 – Nick’s VR experience</li><li>00:10:04 – Galaxy VR</li><li>00:23:20 – Samsung’s current-gen rivals</li><li>00:35:32 – Where VR excels</li><li>00:48:03 – Smart glasses</li><li>01:06:48 – Laser Dance</li><li>01:11:16 – Wrap-up</li></ul><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> is a brand new version of Android built specifically for XR devices, and while the Galaxy XR mixed reality headset is the first Android XR device to market, we're expecting a treasure trove of smart glasses to use the operating system next year.</p><p>That includes companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-we-want-to-see-from-samsung-android-xr-glasses">like Samsung</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-android-xr-glasses-project-aura-meta-orion-similar">Xreal</a>, who are expected to debut a wide range of products including display-less AI glasses and even full-fledged AR glasses. What are your thoughts on XR, as a whole? Are you excited about smart glasses, can't wait to get a top-notch VR headset, or have another opinion? Let us know! We'd love to hear it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Plus, it comes with a built-in LED flashlight, topographical map information, and sports and activity profiles for a wide range of sports such as soccer, baseball, football, volleyball and more.</p><p>To be sure, it stands up to many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-and-fitness-trackers-gps">best GPS smartwatches and fitness trackers</a> on the market, and while the price point is normally a deterrent, it starts to seem highly competitive at just $619.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Garmin-epix-Pro-Gen-2-51mm-High-Performance-Smartwatch-Advanced-Training-Technology-Built-in-Flashlight-Black/3253998041" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fgQAnsurLEHrTe4Qw8DLiM" name="garmin epix pro gen 2 reco 600x600.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fgQAnsurLEHrTe4Qw8DLiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2):</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Garmin-epix-Pro-Gen-2-51mm-High-Performance-Smartwatch-Advanced-Training-Technology-Built-in-Flashlight-Black/3253998041" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$999.99</del> <strong>$619.99 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p>With <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday still weeks away, Walmart has launched a $380 discount on the second-gen Garmin Epix Pro smartwatch.

To catch up, Apple seems ready to use a solution from an unexpected source: Google.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> report says Apple is about to sign a deal to pay around $1 billion each year for a custom version of Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> model. This model has about 1.2 trillion parameters, while Apple’s current model has about 150 billion.</p><p>Apple reportedly plans to run this Gemini-based model on its own Private Cloud Compute servers. This means Google supplies the model, while Apple keeps it behind its own walls to preserve its privacy narrative. The revamped Siri is expected to roll out in spring 2026, possibly as part of iOS 26.4.</p><p>This move also shows that Apple recognizes its AI models are not yet ready. Earlier this year, Apple looked at other AI partners, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, before choosing Google. The deal does not mean Google’s search engine or brand will appear in Apple’s interface; most of the integration will happen in the background.</p><h2 id="temporary-boost-2">Temporary boost</h2><p>For Apple, this is a smart temporary solution. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">gets access to a powerful model now</a> while it works on its own future AI. The report says Apple is developing its own cloud-based model with about 1 trillion parameters.</p><p>However, there are caveats. The agreement isn’t fully public yet, so details might change. And while more parameters usually mean stronger models, user experience depends on a lot more than just size — datasets, latency, privacy, integration all matter. Also, Apple has had AI-feature delays before.</p><p>If the deal pans out, Siri <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-should-ditch-siri-for-gemini-and-google-cloud-heres-why">could become much more capable</a> by spring 2026, thanks to Google’s AI. The $1 billion per year price may make heads turn, but since Apple is catching up in AI, paying for access makes sense right now.</p> ]]></dc:content>
