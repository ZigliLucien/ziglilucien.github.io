<ul><li>LineageOS 22.1 is here for over 100 devices, based on Android 15 QPR1, with two new system apps.</li><li>Twelve is a new default music player that replaces Eleven, one of LineageOS' oldest apps.</li><li>LineageOS 22.1 supports devices as old as the Pixel 2 series and as new as the Pixel 9 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>LineageOS, an Android custom ROM project that aims to support both new and old smartphones, is already adding support for Android 15. The team <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lineageos.org/Changelog-29/" target="_blank">announced</a> today, Dec. 31, that LineageOS 22.1 is rolling out based on the latest Android 15 QPR1.  It was able to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to LineageOS quicker than expected due to the breakthroughs made adapting Android 12 through Android 14, according to the blog post.</p><p>"This is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a device perspective we have seen in years," wrote Nolen Johnson, the developer relations manager for LineageOS, in the blog post. "This means that many more devices are ready on day one that we’d typically expect to have up this early in the cycle."</p><p>Aside from the system improvements brought by Android 15, LineageOS 22.1 includes a few new features and additions. For starters, security patches as recent as November 2024 have been merged to LineageOS 19.1 through 22.1. There are also two new apps: Twelve and Camelot.</p><p>Twelve is a brand-new music player that replaces the prior music player, Eleven. As one of the oldest LineageOS apps, the team explained that it was time for a replacement. Eleven was becoming noncompliant with new Android guidelines due to its older codebase, and Twelve is an improved replacement.</p>

<p>Some of the new app's highlights include Material You design language and support for tablets and landscape mode. It'll integrate with major music server protocols, like Subsonic, OpenSubsonic, and Jellyfin. On top of that, there's better search, improved Android Auto support, and new support for streaming protocols — such as HLS, DASH, and SmoothStreaming.</p><p>Camelot is a basic PDF viewer that aims to fill the gap left by LineageOS' Jelly and WebViews, which can't open PDF files. It's described as a simple app based on Google Chrome and Files by Google releases.</p><p>LineageOS will use a decimal integer system moving forward to match Android's quarterly platform releases (QPRs). LineageOS 22.1 is based on Android 15 QPR1, and a future Android 15 QPR2 update would eventually lead to LineageOS 22.2.</p><p>Of course, LineageOS is best known for supporting older devices, and support is excellent out of the gate. You can find more information on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/" target="_blank">LineageOS Wiki</a>, but over 100 devices are eligible for the latest upgrade on day one. That includes older devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-2-review">Google Pixel 2</a>, and newer ones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>.</p>

<ul><li>New features found within the OHealth app preview fitness and health tools that could come to the OnePlus Watch 3.</li><li>The app includes ECG support, wrist temperature detection, a 60-second checkup mode, and more.</li><li>Separately, code strings reveal that OnePlus may be releasing two OnePlus Watch 3 variants: a OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 Pro.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> offered the best battery life of any Wear OS watch while hitting an affordable price point, it fell short in a few areas. Notably, the OnePlus Watch 2's fitness and health monitoring was lacking. OnePlus might be flipping the script with the OnePlus Watch 3, adding an expansive suite of fitness and health features that could make it competitive with some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> around.</p><p>For starters, we should point out that these new features could be coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/major-oneplus-watch-3-specs-leak">OnePlus Watch 3</a> <em>series</em>. According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-pro-3512051/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, code strings in the OHealth app include mentions of not only a OnePlus Watch 3, but also a OnePlus Watch 3 Pro. On top of that, a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-ohealth-features-apk-teardown-3512061/" target="_blank">report</a> details a handful of new health features found in <strong>version 4.30.11_e27d199_241122</strong> of the OHealth app.</p><p>Notably, the app appears to support features that aren't possible with current OnePlus Watch hardware. The biggest new functionality is electrocardiogram (ECG) support, which was absent on the OnePlus Watch 2 but could come to the OnePlus Watch 3 series. You'll be able to start an ECG reading from your smartphone (providing it meets OnePlus' system requirements), and get access to health insights based on the results.</p><p>For example, an ECG reading could result in any number of determinations, including sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, frequent PVCs, frequent PACs, high or low heart rate, or an inconclusive reading. Not all of these results are bad (sinus rhythm is simply the term for the regular electrical impulses of a heart pumping) but all of them can be insightful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1625px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.55%;"><img id="svVSTf8aNtaStwTBs7SSjM" name="IMG_0541" alt="Screenshots of the Ohealth app from an APK teardown from Android Authority." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/svVSTf8aNtaStwTBs7SSjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1625" height="919" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another new capability found in the OHealth app is wrist temperature detection. Like other smartwatches that offer the feature, you'll need to wear your OnePlus Watch to sleep for five days to get a baseline temperature. From there, you'll be able to view whether your wrist temperature is normal, above baseline, or below baseline.</p><p>Since the OnePlus Watch 2 lacks a temperature sensor, this once again looks like an upcoming OnePlus Watch 3 and Watch 3 Pro feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 activity data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of these features are just OnePlus catching up to the competition, but others are brand new — like the 60-second checkup mode uncovered in the OHealth app. It'll run a quick check of seven health indicators to look for signs of a few major health risks: heart health, blood vessel elasticity, and sleep snoring.</p><p>To house all of these features, the OHealth app is gaining a dedicated Health tab for these data points. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-wishlist">With how underwhelming the OnePlus Watch 2 was</a> in terms of health and fitness capabilities, it's a good sign that the OHealth app seems to be getting prepped for a slew of new offerings.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims to have discovered several model numbers concerning the future of Samsung's foldables in the One UI 7 beta.</li><li>From the list, it seems Samsung is crafting the next Flip 7 and Fold 7, as well as another Fold Special Edition.</li><li>The rumored "Flip FE" was notably missing; however, a recent database discovery detailed its model number.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Samsung pushing ahead with its One UI 7 beta, its code might hold clues about the company's overall foldable plans.</p><p>A teardown of the beta thus far by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-special-edition-model-numbers-3511581/">Android Authority</a>) reportedly contains a list of model numbers. According to the tipster, the list of internal names suggests the future of Samsung's foldables, beginning with the book-style device, the Galaxy Z Fold. The post states the beta offers model number SM-F968, which is supposedly a "successor" to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>.</p><p>Speaking of new foldables, the publication states that it did not find signs of a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-fe-rumors-rekindled-next-year">Galaxy Z Flip FE</a>." This clamshell has been rumored for a few months now; however, the tipster states the latest software beta didn't contain its would-be model number.</p><p>What the beta does contain are the apparent model numbers for Samsung's next wave of Galaxy Z Flip and Fold devices. Allegedly, the upcoming wave of phones feature model numbers SM-F751 and SM-F966, respectively. The post is relatively confident that these concern the next-gen foldables, considering the model numbers have jumped "by 10," which is "tradition with Samsung."</p>

<p>The One UI 7 beta curiously lacks the rumored Flip FE model number, but a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-working-on-a-cheap-galaxy-z-flip-and-a-surprise-for-the-watch-8">GSMA database discovery</a> holds more for us. The device's internal number — SM-F761B — was discovered recently and believed to be the highly anticipated Galaxy Z Flip FE. This device is expected to arrive as a cheaper alternative to the standard flagship clamshell model in 2025.</p><p>More importantly, a rumor from November claimed the device <em>could </em>launch alongside the Flip 7 and Fold 7, likely in the middle of 2025. Additionally, the phone could debut with Samsung's in-house Exynos 2400e chipset. This is the same chip that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> sports.</p><p>This isn't the only Samsung foldable news to surface as, last week, a report claimed the company was interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">slashing its 2025 shipments</a>. Compared to the Flip 5/Fold 5, Samsung's Flip 6/Fold 6 was underwhelming and underperformed. It's been rumored that the Korean OEM could set aside roughly 5 million foldable units next year with the Flip 7 making up ~3 million of them.</p><p>For context, the company's Flip 5 and Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">shattered records</a> with a whopping 1.02 million pre-orders in South Korea.

<ul><li>Vivo’s mixed-reality team has supposedly reached over 500 members and the company is going all-in on a new headset.</li><li>At an event Dec. 31, the company revealed plans to prototype a mixed-realty headset with features that could surpass Apple Vision Pro.</li><li>The headset is said to deliver “high-fidelity prototype experiences” in a few cities in late 2025, but there’s no word on when a Vivo headset would be available for purchase.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The race to build the best mixed-reality headsets is heating up, and we’re starting to see just as many cryptic, unreleased prototypes as widely-available products. The market will gain one more prototype in 2025, as Vivo announced plans to reveal a mixed-reality headset late next year at an event Dec. 31, 2024. Vivo has lofty goals for the headset, and wants to dethrone Apple Vision Pro in a few areas, according to information relayed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5117293942543312" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_will_unveil_a_mixed_reality_headset_next_year-news-65904.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>Aside from a generic teaser image, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">Vivo</a> didn’t share any details about its future headset. An unveiling is slated for next fall, sometime in September and October. At this stage, Vivo’s mixed-reality headset will almost certainly be a prototype. In fact, Vivo says that it expects to offer “high-fidelity prototype experiences" with its headset in select Chinese cities by the end of 2025.</p><p>Of course, aside from a confident pledge that Vivo’s mixed-reality headset will top <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Apple Vision Pro</a>, Vivo doesn’t have anything to share about how it will achieve that goal. Vision Pro, while considered a commercial failure by Apple’s usual standards, is still lauded for its impressive hardware and feature set. That’s likely why Vivo is targeting Vision Pro, especially in its home country of China.</p><p>It is worth noting that Vision Pro, released in February 2024, will be well over a year old when Vivo supposedly plans to best it with its own mixed-reality headset at the tail end of 2025.</p>

<p>Although the company gave us a general idea of when a prototype Vivo headset will be revealed, there’s no word yet on pricing or general availability. It isn’t the only company to tease a mixed-reality product you can’t buy yet — and likely won’t be able to for a long time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta teased Orion earlier this year</a>, a pair of MR glasses too expensive to mass produce. More recently, Samsung showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>, which will be the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os">Android XR</a> headset to debut next year.</p><p>Being that so little is known about the Vivo headset, it’s probably best to approach it with a bit of skepticism. Pricing and availability have been huge barriers to mixed-reality tech to date. Meta’s Quest headsets are affordable but not necessarily top-tier, while Apple Vision Pro has great hardware and costs a fortune. It’s unclear where Vivo will fall, or if it’ll be somewhere in the middle.</p>

<hr>
<p>Ahead of the OnePlus 13R's official launch, set for Jan. 7, 2025, a massive leak revealed renders showing every angle of the upcoming midranger. The images were shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin" target="_blank">Arsène Lupin on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and show off what appear to be the only two OnePlus 13R colorways (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_13r_leaked_renders_show_both_colorways_in_detail-news-65905.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). While the official names of each color option aren't known, they look like versions of silver and space gray.</p><p>OnePlus has been teasing the OnePlus 13R for a few weeks now, and revealed some information about the device. However, we don't know as much about the OnePlus 13R as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, which is already available in China. Instead, the OnePlus 13R is likely to be a global rendition of the OnePlus Ace 5. With that being said, some already-known differences — like the smaller battery capacity — prove that the OnePlus 13R isn't a perfect rebrand of the Ace 5.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">13R pic.twitter.com/Svo524o8at<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1873695192198664574">December 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Previously, OnePlus only shared a cryptic, zoomed image of the OnePlus 13R's camera bump and rear chassis. This is the first time we've seen a complete look of the OnePlus 13R, if these leaked renders are indeed accurate. It represents a significant design change for OnePlus' midrange phone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> had a slim, curved design language that has been ditched for a boxy and rectangular look.</p><p>The display and back panel both appear to be flat, marking a long-overdue shift from OnePlus' curved screens. The entire smartphone market is moving in this direction, with Samsung, Google, and Apple, all releasing phones with a rectangular chassis.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/BYWFhUc1gS<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1873695720462795156">December 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Otherwise, the OnePlus 13R looks like it'll keep a few OnePlus staples — as expected. For starters, there's the circular camera bump and the etched OnePlus logo on the back. You also get the OnePlus alert slider and a physical SIM card tray.</p><p>Beyond these leaks, OnePlus has already confirmed that the OnePlus 13R will feature a thin form factor and a 6,000mAh battery capacity. Additionally, an early Amazon listing revealed it'll be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset</a>. To learn more about the OnePlus 13R, you'll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13r-is-a-thin-midranger-with-a-6-000mah-battery-arriving-january-7">tune into the Jan. 7, 2025 launch event</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>We saw some great releases this year and most importantly many sales. I particularly found it interesting that during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there were many people who were clicking on our deals for a Chromebook. Perhaps it really was an upgrade year! <br><br>That being said, Samsung outperformed everyone with a double whammy, releasing the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra. Samsung took both slots as Best Chromebook and Tablet of the Year and we congratulate you wholeheartedly!!</p><p>But you don't have to hear from me, I think it goes without saying that our resident Chromebook and Tablet expert Andrew Myrick says it all, here's what he has to say.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-chromebook-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus"><span>Best Chromebook: Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="95c9nStgqwKfiDgrYRVQw3" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-14.jpg" alt="Empty desktop on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/95c9nStgqwKfiDgrYRVQw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Andrew Myrick:</strong> Not many of us had Samsung releasing a Chromebook on our "2024 Bingo Cards," yet here we are with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>. Considering that it's been about three years since the last Samsung Chromebook was released, this latest offering makes a splash in a few different ways.</p><p>For one, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is the thinnest 15.6-inch Chromebook that's ever been released. With that, it weighs just 2.58 pounds, making it one of the lighter laptops out there, and not just in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook category</a>. Not to mention that Samsung still managed to squeeze a bunch of ports into this beast, including a full-size HDMI port and even a microSD Card slot.</p><p>Outside of the screen and design, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus was the first Chromebook to be released with the new "Quick Insert Key." This is Google's way of trying to make it easier to use and interact with Gemini in various ways. The best part is that the Quick Insert Key can be used across the entirety of ChromeOS and isn't just limited to Google's own apps.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus</p><p>Without naming any names, there was one member of the Android Central staff who voted for something other than the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. So with that, Lenovo's Flex 5i Chromebook Plus makes it onto the podium, but it's not just for the sake of avoiding a Samsung sweep.</p><p>The Flex 5i Chromebook Plus is a fantastic device in its own right, arguably offering better versatility than the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. In addition to the included AI features and all-day battery life, the Flex 5i also sports a convertible design, complete with a touchscreen display — two things that you won't find on Samsung's latest Chromebook.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-android-tablet-samsung-galaxy-s10-ultra"><span>Best Android tablet: Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6j72Dx7E2yDydzZ2tjwR4c" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-with-keyboard-case-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra in Book Cover Keyboard case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6j72Dx7E2yDydzZ2tjwR4c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Andrew Myrick: </strong>Without burying the lede, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> is the staff's pick for best tablet of the year. However, it's not quite as clear-cut of a victory compared to years past. Functionally speaking, the Tab S10 Ultra is still probably the closest you'll get to being a true laptop replacement, thanks to its massive 14.6-inch display.</p><p>All of the regular bells and whistles are on board, such as the included S Pen in the box, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>, and, of course, there's plenty of AI to go around. Samsung even kept the design practically identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a>, meaning that you don't need to run out and buy a new case if you want to upgrade.</p><p>However, this is the first time in years that Samsung's flagship tablet hasn't been powered by a Qualcomm chip. Instead, Samsung opted for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a>, which is quite impressive, but the decision does leave us scratching our heads a bit.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus Pad 2, RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</p><p>As for the runner-up, well, there are actually two. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/nubias-new-gaming-tablet-crushes-the-competition-with-a-premium-chipset-and-built-in-fan">RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</a> tied for second place. Unlike Samsung's offering, both of these tablets are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 but take very different approaches.</p><p>The OnePlus Pad 2 is more of a refinement over the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a>, with most of the "drastic" changes coming via the software. Released alongside the Pad 2 are the OnePlus Pad Smart Keyboard and Stylo 2. The obvious goal is to offer a portable productivity powerhouse, especially when paired with a OnePlus phone.</p><p>When it comes to the RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet, the premise is right in the name. RedMagic is becoming synonymous with gaming, catering to a niche that just wants the fastest and most powerful devices possible. And that's exactly what you get from the Nova Gaming Tablet, at least until the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> tablets start to arrive.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'm going to be honest here, I didn't really know much about XR or Smart Glasses, until I had to edit and follow the work of my incredibly knowledgeable colleague Nick Sutrich. <br><br>Through reading his extensive coverage of the world of XR and Smart Glasses, it's been a lot easier for me to understand how important these two categories have become in the world of Android. And especially with the big announcement that Google and Samsung will launch Android XR as a Meta Quest competitor next year, this mixed-reality space is only going to get more exciting.</p><p>For now, congrats to Meta for the Meta Quest 3S, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and for the best games, we have Batman: Arkham Shadow and Just Dance! <br><br>Here's what Nick had to say.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-xr-headset-or-smart-glasses-meta-quest-3s"><span>Best XR headset or smart glasses: Meta Quest 3S</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VmhgPSSJMmbqhSEKmJkgyS" name="Meta-Quest-3S-with-controllers" alt="A Meta Quest 3S headset with both of its included controllers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VmhgPSSJMmbqhSEKmJkgyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich:</strong> The XR industry continued to grow during 2024, and a few devices have helped attract new users, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review" target="_blank">Meta Quest 3S</a>. Meta’s latest headset is our XR device of the year because it delivers unparalleled value in the space, helping to bring in new users and give Quest 2 users an easy upgrade path without spending a ton of money. It might have the Quest 2’s lenses and display, but everything else is a massive upgrade, including the next-gen Snapdragon chipset inside.</p><p>Not only that, but Meta included Batman: Arkham Shadow for free with every Meta Quest 3S, further enticing new users into the fold with a series they know and love. For $299, Meta somehow included almost everything that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> a fantastic experience, including the new controllers with better haptics and full-color, high-resolution passthrough vision. It’s created an explosion of fantastic mixed reality games, and it’s going to help usher in a new wave of next-gen VR games in 2025 and beyond.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</p><p>While these technically came out in 2023, Meta basically relaunched the entire product category with the introduction of Meta AI tools on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> back in April. Further updates were launched in September, including live translation and other impressive multimodal AI features right from your face. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">Live AI</a> and music recognition, among other features, were added just a few days ago, showing that Meta is all about keeping these glasses as useful and relevant as possible.</p><p>Of course, all the base perks of the glasses from last year still stand. They’re a relatively affordable pair of frames with support for nearly all prescription types. I love wearing mine as a replacement for earbuds more often than not, and they’re mind-blowingly handy for taking phone calls, snapping quick pictures or videos (hands-free!), or just listening and responding to messages without having to stare at your phone.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-new-single-player-vr-game-batman-arkham-shadow"><span>Best new single-player VR game: Batman Arkham Shadow</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wgkQaKNmwQ6Rb7wpyqdCwZ" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-combat-still.jpeg" alt="A still from Batman: Arkham Shadow showing combat, including a combo number, attack instructions, and a health bar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wgkQaKNmwQ6Rb7wpyqdCwZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich:</strong> This year has been a stupendous year for VR gaming, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> shines even among the crowded room for its excellence in game design, storytelling, voice acting, and unique gameplay mechanics that perfectly translate the Arkham experience to Meta Quest 3 headsets. Batman: Arkham Shadow takes home our 2024 VR single-player game of the year award.</p><p>Arkham Shadow’s original story takes place between Arkham Origins and Arkham Asylum, letting you explore the Blackgate Prison in a way never before seen in a Batman game. You’ll switch between two characters throughout the story to undercover the identity behind the Rat King and experience the most authentic way to feel what Batman feels: by donning the cowl, your unofficial detective badge, and a license to beat up anyone who’s had it coming.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-new-multi-player-vr-game-just-dance-vr-welcome-to-dancity"><span>Best new multi-player VR game: Just Dance VR – Welcome to Dancity</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D2ZpsvRmjhye4dhBop2kmE" name="Just-Dance-VR" alt="Screenshot of Just Dance VR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D2ZpsvRmjhye4dhBop2kmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ubisoft)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich:</strong> The long-awaited VR entry into the storied Just Dance series is the best way to learn the moves you’ve always wanted to, all to your favorite songs of the day. But we’ve been there and done that for the past 15 years with the series, so why did it get our 2024 VR multiplayer game of the year award? Because of Dancity.</p><p>Ubisoft and co-developer Soul Assembly put together a brilliant way to not only play and dance with friends but also to hang out with them in a spectacular “metaverse” style world called Dancity. It makes the game come alive in ways the series has never done before, and it makes playing the multiplayer component not only feel unique but also like a cohesive experience that we simply didn’t expect from a rhythm game.</p><p>Check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/just-dance-vr-welcome-to-dancity/6646371635430939/">Just Dance VR – Welcome to Dancity</a> today!</p>

<ul><li>Two new Samsung devices have already passed through the GSMA database.</li><li>The first is the Galaxy Z Flip FE, carrying a model number of SM-F761B.</li><li>The other is the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic with a model number of SM-L505U.</li></ul>
<p>While foldable phones have seen their ups and downs, many have been wondering if Samsung would give its offerings the "Fan Edition (FE)" treatment. Usually, when there's a new Galaxy FE device, this means that it's a bit more budget-friendly compared to its non-FE counterparts.</p><p>It seems that Samsung is already gearing up for its next lineup of foldable phones, as the "Galaxy Z Flip XE" was spotted in the GSMA database (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-and-galaxy-watch8-classic-in-the-works/">SmartPrix</a>.) If you were hoping for this listing to share any specifics, you're a bit out of luck. However, the database listing does seem to confirm the model number of SM-F761B.</p><p>Samsung has been rumored to be looking into releasing a cheaper foldable phone. In late November, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">rumors suggested</a> Samsung would release the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE alongside the Flip 7 and Fold 7, while being powered by the Exynos 2400e.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Flex-Mode-Panel.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex Mode Panel with Instagram running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the same chip found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, offering solid performance while offering Samsung a way to come in at a lower cost. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is said to be powered by the Exynos 2500, which has yet to be officially announced.</p><p>Recently, a report surfaced suggesting that Samsung is drastically lowering sales expectations for its 2025 foldable phones. The company is reportedly planning to sell five million units, with the Flip 7 accounting for three million, and the Fold 7 covering the rest. That being said, this most recent report doesn't take into account the possible release of the Flip 7 FE.</p><p>That being said, Samsung's summer 2025 launch event might have a bit more than just a new foldable phone. Actually, the company could end up bringing back a fan favorite, but not in the form of the Fan Edition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zf4zp3Q9kXJw3piCVVngMk" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-Ultra-6.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (left, silver) and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (right, black) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zf4zp3Q9kXJw3piCVVngMk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>SmartPrix found another unannounced Samsung device in the GSMA database. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic and its SM-L505U model number also made an appearance.</p><p>This is particularly interesting as there was no "Classic" included with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> lineup. Instead, Samsung opted for the Watch 7 in two sizes, with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> launching alongside.</p><p>The main distinction between the "regular" Watch and the Watch Classic is the physical rotating bezel. While Samsung has been offering a touch-sensitive bezel on the Watch for a few years, it's still not quite as reliable as having the physical option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nmj9QzsAtKafiFf76tzvDH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-bezel.jpeg" alt="A close-up side-view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, focused on the rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nmj9QzsAtKafiFf76tzvDH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point, it feels as though Samsung is taking an "on again, off again" approach with the Classic. So from that perspective, it makes sense for this to be an option with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, but there are some who wish Samsung would just keep this as part of the yearly refresh.</p><p>Before getting too excited about a shift to an earlier release schedule, it's not uncommon for unannounced devices to pass through these kinds of databases early. With that in mind, we don't expect any official announcement until sometime in the summer of 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung appears to be including a crash detection virtual sensor on the upcoming Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>Although similar or identical sensors have appeared on prior Samsung devices, the company hasn't rolled out a feature making use of them.</li><li>It's still unclear whether Samsung plans to introduce a car crash detection feature on the Galaxy S25 series or with One UI 7.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung might finally catch up to Apple and Google by including a critical safety feature on the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-car-crash-detection-sensor-3511840/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, leaked code strings from the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra reveal that the company will once again include a virtual car crash sensor. It's worth noting that although past Galaxy phones have included a similar or identical sensor, Samsung hasn't released a car crash detection feature yet.</p><p>The leaked files mention a <strong>Car Crash Detect Wakeup</strong> sensor, which is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> sensor of the same name as ones previously spotted on the Galaxy S24 series and select Samsung foldables. This sensor is not a single hardware sensor in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a virtual sensor that compiles data from multiple hardware sensors in an effort to detect when a car crash has occurred.</p><p>Being that Samsung keeps including the Car Crash Detect Wakeup sensor, it appears that the company is still working on bringing a car crash detection feature to Galaxy phones. The brand is clearly behind the curve. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel">Google added a car crash detection feature to Pixel phones</a> way back and 2019 and Apple followed suit in 2022.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G2jTwQ3PkYe4RjaFE8FhMm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-white-back-01.jpg" alt="Looking at the different colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G2jTwQ3PkYe4RjaFE8FhMm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, as Android Authority notes, this isn't a guarantee that a working feature will be available on the Galaxy S25 series. There have been code strings and hidden system apps hinting at car crash detection since as early as 2023, but a public and working feature has not been made available yet. Sometimes, these safety features are region locked, but there's no evidence of car crash detection being available on Samsung devices in any region.</p><p>The good news is that, theoretically, the virtual sensor's inclusion in the Galaxy S25 series codebase means Samsung's upcoming flagships will get car crash detection whenever it becomes available as part of One UI. At the moment, it's not available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>.</p>

<p>Over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/looking-at-the-mobile-tech-market-in-2025">past month alone</a>, Google has introduced quite a few updates to Gemini. These include things such as the Deep Research feature, which is touted as "your personal AI research assistant," and is already available. At the same time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental</a> was announced, providing an updated AI model supporting multimodal inputs, while outperforming Gemini 1.5 Pro "on key benchmarks, at twice the speed."</p><p>A goal within Google is for Gemini to become the company's "next app to reach half a billion users." However, Pichai confirmed that there are some challenges ahead, and expects "some back and forth." Ultimately, Pichai believes that Gemini can lead the industry while stating "In history, you don't always need to be first but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product."</p><p>From there, Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, claimed that "the products themselves are going to evolve massively over the next year or two." Hassabis went on to provide a bit of a goal, aiming for "a universal assistant that can seamlessly operate over any domain, any modality or any device."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.19%;"><img id="scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP" name="google-project-astra-enters-signup-phase" alt="Google's Project Astra lets testers point their cameras at items within its app to receive information about it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1050" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And if you're wondering where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a> stands in all of this, Hassabis shared that it "will be updated in the first half of the year." In early December, Google made it possible to sign up for the "trusted tester waitlist," however, the floodgates have not been opened just yet.</p><p>As if there wasn't enough pressure from various government agencies, Google is also feeling the pressure from OpenAI. The AI giant recently concluded its "12 days of ship-mas," where a variety of new features were introduced. Arguably the biggest of which was Sora, which lets you create AI-generated videos using nothing more than a text prompt.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP" name="ChatGPT-hero.jpg" alt="ChatGPT conversation screen on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1012" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not only that, but OpenAI also announced some major improvements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-search-feature-rollout">ChatGPT Search</a>, clearly setting Google in its sights. And not to be outdone by Gemini 2.0, OpenAI revealed its o3 and o3 mini AI models, which are said to offer a substantial improvement over the previous o1 and o1 mini models.</p><p>However, OpenAI also recently introduced ChatGPT Pro, a new subscription priced at $200 per month. By signing up, you are provided "with the highest level of access," including unlimited access to GPT-4o, o1, and advanced voice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Sge3x7PigWQGRRhrfz2HXf" name="chatgpt-pricing-12-2024" alt="ChatGPT Subscription plans as of December 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sge3x7PigWQGRRhrfz2HXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is one area of concern for everyone who's even tangentially interested in the future of AI, including whether Google plans to charge similar prices to access Gemini. In the meeting, Hassabis reportedly responded by saying "Right now, we don't have any plans for this kind of subscription level." Of course, there's nothing to say that this couldn't change tomorrow, but it does offer a bit of reprieve if you have concerns.</p><p>Providing a roadmap for what it expects to achieve in 2025 is just one piece of the puzzle. It's even more important to follow through, reach, and maybe even surpass those goals. Needless to say, it'll be quite interesting to see how everything plays out over the course of the next 12 months.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A leak sheds some light on what to expect from the OnePlus Open 2.</li><li>Some of the expected improvements include an IPX8 rating, wireless charging, and a larger battery.</li><li>The Open 2 is said to be a rebranded Oppo Find N5, and will see a "global release in late Q1 2025."</li></ul>
<p>After OnePlus and parent company Oppo made the curious decision to forego a new foldable phone in 2024, it appears that won't be the case for 2025. A new leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-oneplus-open-2-first-look/">SmartPrix</a> shares a couple of renders for the OnePlus Open 2, while also revealing some of the key improvements we can expect to see.</p><p>According to the provided renders, it appears that the OnePlus Open 2 will largely retain the same design as its predecessor. This includes the round and massive rear camera module, housing a triple-lens setup. It's expected to be headlined by a 50MP main lens, while also including a 50MP ultrawide lens and a 50MP telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yTZcKqiZRTr9mRmHka5vG4" name="oneplus-open-2-rear-camera-smartprix-leak" alt="OnePlus Open 2 rear camera leak from SmartPrix" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTZcKqiZRTr9mRmHka5vG4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="2560" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, the rumored specs are what we expected, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> powering the Open 2. SmartPrix claims OnePlus will pair this chip with 16GB of RAM and "a generous 1TB of storage." It's unclear whether this will be the only configuration available, or if the OnePlus Open 2 will also come with 512GB of storage.</p><p>As for the displays, we're expecting a 6.4-inch AMOLED Cover Screen, which is slightly larger compared to the original Open (6.31-inch.) This isn't the only difference to be found, as OnePlus is also rumored to use a larger 8-inch LTPO inner screen with a 2K resolution, and 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="W2qi2EFZjWXrttheoT7jP4" name="oneplus-open-2-inner-screen-smartprix-leak" alt="OnePlus Open 2 inner display leak from SmartPrix" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2qi2EFZjWXrttheoT7jP4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Keeping with the idea of "bigger, faster, better," these latest rumors suggest OnePlus will introduce a larger 5,900mAh battery. This offers a massive improvement over the 4,800mAh cell from its predecessor. Speaking of which, the lack of wireless charging was a sticking point for some, but that won't be the case with the Open 2. In addition to the 80W wired charging speeds, the Open 2 is expected to also offer up to 50W wireless charging.</p><p>That's not all that SmartPrix had to share, as the Open 2 is said to "measure just under 10mm thin." The exact dimensions weren't provided, but if this comes to fruition, it would be even thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> (10.5mm when folded.) Lastly, the Open 2 is expected to offer better water resistance with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-resistance-rating-camera-specs-tipped">IPX8 rating</a>, an improvement over the IPX4 from the previous model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-22.jpg" alt="Comparing the thickness between the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As expected, the Open 2 will essentially be a rebranded Oppo Find N5, as with the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and Find N4. The Find N5 is said to arrive "in China early next year, followed by a global release in late Q1 2025." SmartPrix goes on to say that the launch of the Open 2 will likely coincide with that of the Find N5.</p><p>If everything goes according to plan, the OnePlus Open 2 and Oppo Find N5 could be the first two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> released in 2025. However, there's always a chance that issues crop up, delaying one of the most highly anticipated new phone releases.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Hicks: </strong>Samsung makes the best Android watches, but none of its three 2024 releases was our favorite. The Watch FE was too downgraded, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7</a> a bit too safe and same-y, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a> too expensive for anyone besides me to have tried, no matter how excellent it was.</p><p>Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> was the overwhelming favorite, a fast, decently long-lasting smartwatch with improved running tools for couch-to-5Kers. It was one of my favorite reviews of the year, and many of my colleagues ditched their old watches for a Watch 3 this year.</p><p>I think most people were happy to finally have a larger display with a smaller bezel — not to mention the doubled brightness and smoother refresh rate — but I think our collective excitement came down to the Watch 3 still feeling fresh. People prefer its soft-edged, striking style to the Galaxy Watch’s flat, unchanged look, even if it’s more durable. And as a bunch of Google power users, they’re most excited by new Google Home integrations that make the Watch 3 interconnected with their other devices.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus Watch 2R</p><p>The more competitive battle was for the runner-up slot. The Galaxy Watch 7 got a couple of votes, while Garmin spread out its votes among different options. But a dark horse swooped in: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, which I also gave a strong review. In this case, it’s the clear inverse of the Pixel Watch 3: not very attractive or strong for health insights, but much more affordable, far stronger for battery life, and just as fast for overall performance. It’s the mid-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> we’ve been waiting for.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-ring-oura-ring-4"><span>Best smart ring: Oura Ring 4</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-09.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 with the Android Bot figure" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Derrek Lee: </strong>Smart rings are still a growing market, but Oura has proven that there’s plenty of merit in the form factor. The arrival of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>, along with a slew of new contenders, big and small, shows that consumers are interested. At first glance, Oura’s latest model may not look like a huge upgrade from its predecessor, but the company has made some significant changes to enhance the overall experience while improving accuracy and battery life.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 refines the design for a more comfortable and durable fit, making it perfect to wear while sleeping in case you don’t like to wear your smartwatch to bed. However, the updated design isn’t just cosmetic; the flush sensors are arranged in such a way that readings should be more accurate with more pathways between sensors.</p><p>This is aided by Oura’s new Smart Sensing technology, which not only improves the ring’s health tracking but also extends battery life. And with the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/can-oura-ring-4-automatically-detect-workouts">automatic activity tracking</a>, the ring not only detects workouts like running, biking, HIIT, and yoga, but it will also automatically monitor your heart rate when it does, so you don’t have to manually track workouts for more comprehensive data.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Ultrahuman Ring Air</p><p>There are plenty of impressive smart rings in the market, but the runner-up on our list is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, which has been giving Oura a run for its money in more ways than one. It has a comfortable fit and comes with great sleep-tracking features. And like Oura, Ultrahuman has also been adding new features to its ring, even some you can’t find on the Oura Ring, like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-dont-more-smartwatches-use-this-smart-rings-seemingly-obvious-trick">cool new smart alarm</a>. And the best part is that, unlike Oura, there’s no subscription to use its most useful features.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-android-phone-google-pixel-9-pro"><span>Best Android phone: Google Pixel 9 Pro</span></h2>

<p><strong>Nick Sutrich: </strong>In a sea of phones that feel similar, Google has done a monumental job of making a phone that feels different — even if it looks a little too much like an iPhone on the outside for some of us. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> is Android Central’s favorite phone of the year because of its ability to pack the best of the Pixel 9 Pro XL in a smaller body, including the killer triple rear cameras that used to only come on the biggest and most expensive Pixel phones.</p><p>Not only that, but Google’s ability to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> at the core of the Pixel experience to differentiate it from the pack is something to celebrate. Great new apps like Pixel Screenshots are game changers for what Google does best — search — while improvements to the overall interface and user experience with useful AI features made this the favorite of most Android Central staff.</p><p>It might not have received the highest score of all the premium phones we reviewed this year, but there’s something special about the Pixel 9 Pro that kept us coming back and wanting more despite the faults we found with it.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus 12</p><p>Our runner-up is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. I’ll admit it: I haven’t cared about a OnePlus phone in years, and based on the numbers, most of you haven’t either. But the OnePlus 12 changed all that, and it not only got people talking about the brand again, but it also got them to start buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a> again.</p><p>Everything about this phone exhibits the best of OnePlus. From feature-rich software that’s blazing fast and smoother than any other phone to stupidly fast charging that gets you a top-up in minutes and even one of the most eye-friendly OLEDs in the business, it’s nearly impossible not to love the OnePlus 12. That makes it our runner-up for best phone of the year.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-value-phone-google-pixel-8a"><span>Best value phone: Google Pixel 8a</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PuWJAtnvr8uYPKVpSrWtUJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="OnePlus 12R next to Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PuWJAtnvr8uYPKVpSrWtUJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Harish Jonnalagadda:</strong> It should come as no surprise that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> is the best mid-range phone of 2024. It continues to have the best cameras in this category, and Google did a great job with the design this time — if anything, I prefer it to the Pixel 9 Pro in this regard. While the camera modules aren't the latest, Google excels at eking out the best possible photos and videos; there are other phones that come close to the Pixel 8a, but none can meet its consistency.</p><p>Google also made positive strides with the OLED panel, and it now goes up to 120Hz and gets significantly brighter even under harsh sunlight. These are all positive improvements, but it's the software that makes the Pixel 8a truly stand out — it is the only mid-range phone with a clean interface and long-term update guarantee. With Google promising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-many-updates-will-the-pixel-8a-receive">seven years of Android OS updates</a>, it will stay relevant until 2031, which isn't the case with any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">affordable Android phone</a>.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus 12R</p><p>Coming in second is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. OnePlus decided to sell the phone globally starting this year, and that ultimately turned out to be the right call; the phone has the best hardware package in this segment, and although I still give the edge to the Pixel 8a because of its software, the 12R is much better at gaming, has a bigger battery, and unmatched fast charging tech.</p>

<p><strong>Nick Sutrich: </strong>Android Central staff voted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best phone camera</a> of the year, but the results weren’t even close. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review" target="_blank">Vivo X100</a> series took home 14 of our 20 total votes, and it’s no surprise, given how effectively the phone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/replacing-my-dslr-with-vivo-x100-pro">replace a DSLR-style camera</a> in most situations. Vivo’s software is extremely user-friendly yet offers powerful options for folks who need it to do more than they might expect from a phone.</p><p>My favorite part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo experience</a> is the convincing portrait-style photos the phone creates from nearly any zoom level and with any subject. Taking photos of your food is suddenly transformed into a magazine-quality experience, and everything from group photos to landscape shots is simply stunning thanks to the phone’s accurate colors, crisp details, and ability to capture motion without that telltale smartphone blur.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Google Pixel 9 Pro</p><p>The runner-up is no surprise because Google Pixel phones typically win the best camera in any given year. The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the best camera you can buy in the U.S., without a doubt. Google’s photo quality is always top-notch, and it is one of the most reliable camera phones you can use. When you take a photo with a Pixel, there’s almost never a time it’s not a good photo.</p><p>Google ramped things up a notch this year with awesome new features like Add Me, which help get the photographer in the group shot by cleverly using AI to stitch two pictures together. Thanks to some excellent UI design and features that are consistently fun to use, the Pixel 9 Pro is the camera phone to get if you can’t get a Vivo X100.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Myrick:</strong> Well, wouldn't you know it? Neither Samsung nor Google will take home the "best foldable phone" crown in 2024. Instead, it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> that continues to turn heads and impress despite not even being available in North America.</p><p>The Magic V3 packs a punch in all the right ways, starting with a design that is both incredibly sleek and light. As noted in our review, "The Galaxy S24 Ultra is 2g heavier than the Magic V3," which is just insane when you consider the V3 provides a 6.43-inch cover display and a 7.92-inch inner screen.</p><p>Honor made very few sacrifices with the Magic V3, with the biggest issue being the "average battery life." Besides that, we have flagship specs across the board, with the V3 being powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. Honor didn't skimp on the cameras either, with the array comprised of a 50MP main, 50MP periscope telephoto, and a 40MP ultrawide.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</p><p>Coming in second place was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, which Google took in a completely unexpected direction. Instead of attempting to refine the passport style from the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, the 9 Pro Fold is more in line with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and the aforementioned Honor Magic V3.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold's cover screen is the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> while unfolding to reveal a beautiful 8-inch AMOLED display. It's powered by Google's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. Even the battery life is fantastic, easily lasting for more than a day with regular use. We just really wish it had the same cameras as the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL.</p>

<p><strong>Derrek Lee:</strong> Motorola has had something of a resurgence in recent years. While Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip lineup has been pretty same-y for the past couple of generations, Motorola came out of left field with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">revamped Razr in 2023</a>, then gave it a pretty substantial upgrade in 2024.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> is technically not the most powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> on the market — that distinction goes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and its more powerful chipset — however, Motorola makes up for it in other ways, with the overall experience culminating in a phone that I haven’t wanted to put down since I got my hands on it. The design feels so refined with a strong hinge, IPX8 water resistance, and vegan leather on the back of every model.</p><p>I also have almost no complaints about the specs; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8S Gen 3</a> and 12GB of RAM feel plenty speedy, the 4,000mAh battery doesn’t make me feel nervous, and the new 50MP primary camera takes photos that I can actually use. Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">4-inch cover screen</a> is a blast to use, with access to nearly all of your apps.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Xiaomi Mix Flip</p><p>While the Razr Plus 2024 won nearly unanimously, the runner-up was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Xiaomi Mix Flip</a>, which features a more powerful Snapdragon chipset and an equally large (although bigger by 0.01 inches) cover screen. As Xiaomi’s first flip phone, the Mix Flip is quite impressive, with a stunning design, a great set of Leica-powered cameras, and a shockingly large battery for a flip phone. The only problem is that the phone isn’t available in North America or Australia.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-most-improved-android-brand-oneplus"><span>Most improved Android brand: OnePlus</span></h2>

<p><strong>Harish Jonnalagadda:</strong> OnePlus had a standout 2024, and the manufacturer didn't put a foot wrong in the last 12 months. The OnePlus Open is still one of the best foldables around, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> is a terrific mid-range tablet, and the OnePlus 12R is a viable alternative to the Pixel 8a.</p><p>But it's the OnePlus 12 that's particularly notable. While OnePlus rolled out flagships for the better part of a decade, its earlier efforts couldn't quite measure up to what Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Google had to offer. That changed with the OnePlus 12, with the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-camera-impressions-why-it-replaced-my-pixel-9">delivering much better cameras</a>, a brighter AMOLED with eye-friendly tech, and class-leading battery life.</p><p>OnePlus managed to address several of its shortcomings this year, and the fact that it now has devices to take on the best flagships, as well as mid-range phones, makes it truly deserving of the moniker of the most improved brand of 2024.</p>

Last week, I looked back on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-2024-retrospective">Wear OS's strongest year yet</a> and promised that I'd share my predictions for what could happen with Android smartwatches in 2025. So here I am, bearing the promise of presents for loyal Wear OS users — and a couple of lumps of pessimistic coal.</p><p>I'm optimistic that 2025 will be a transformative year for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, building off of 2024's strong foundation and the long-awaited payoff of new Snapdragon hardware and Google's Gemini push.</p><p>That said, we can also see warning signs in what happened in 2024 that could lead to some angst for Android watch owners this year — depending on which brand you own. So good and bad, let's break down what we expect to see from Wear OS watches in 2025, both for hardware and software!</p>
<h2 id="new-snapdragon-hardware-and-a-swap-to-risc-v-2">New Snapdragon hardware (and a swap to RISC-V)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="753wRPDvAPADLF554pLHz6" name="snapdragon-wear-01.jpg" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear chip inside of a smartwatch with a bokeh background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/753wRPDvAPADLF554pLHz6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google, Mobvoi, OnePlus, and Xiaomi used the 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 SoC</a> in nearly all of their Wear OS watches over the last 2.5 years. Unlike annual smartphone chips, watches don't have an application like gaming that requires much headroom; these watches are speedy enough with 2GB of RAM and old silicon. Still, it's fair to expect an upgrade in 2025, as the latest Wear used a Cortex-A53 core first announced in 2012.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">interviewed Qualcomm VP Dino Bekis about Snapdragon Wear</a> in October, and he all but promised that they'd have a Snapdragon Wear chip announcement in 2025. While he offered no specifics about cores, he described it as a "feature-focused" and "AI-driven" chip that could "scale for multiple years" because it'll have enough compute capability to specialize in whatever tools OEMs want.</p><p>Assuming it follows Qualcomm's naming conventions, the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 would probably power most Wear OS watches through 2027. It may use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-is-risc-v">RISC-V</a>, the open-source, energy-efficient platform with custom cores that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-wear-risc-v-upgrade">Qualcomm and Google first partnered on in 2023</a>.</p><p>Bekis said the two companies are still working on porting Wear OS software to RISC-V and that the transition could make Wear OS watches longer-lived, with "a week's worth of battery life" as the goal. I doubt we'll hit that anytime soon, but it's something to hope for.</p><p>Anshel Sag, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, called the potential RISC-V switch "extremely interesting," praising that they'd have cheaper custom chips specialized for the application and that it would "open the door" for new tools. He warned me that he "thinks RISC-V will still take a bit longer than anticipated," but "the payoff could be huge." That could lead Google into looking for alternatives for its Pixel Watch 4, if it's not ready by the 2025 deadline.</p>
<h2 id="google-faces-a-snapdragon-tensor-crossroads-2">Google faces a Snapdragon/Tensor crossroads</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i" name="google-pixel-watch-3-google-tv-controls.jpg" alt="Google TV controls on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Do Wear OS apps need a fancy next-gen processor? Or is "Tensor" enough? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You'd reasonably assume the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> will use the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2, but one leak suggested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/upcoming-pixel-watches-could-play-it-safe-and-i-dont-like-it">Google might play it safe</a> and develop a Tensor chip in-house that's essentially a lower-powered version of the Exynos W1000 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, with a 2020 Cortex-A78 core and two Cortex-A55 cores.</p><p>Google's current Tensor strategy with <em>phones</em> is to focus more on in-house development (partnered with Samsung LSI) and powerful AI performance at the expense of benchmarked power. Google could take a similar approach with watches, deciding it doesn't <em>need</em> much headroom and putting more emphasis on a powerful NPU for Gemini tasks rather than pay Qualcomm a premium to license its Snapdragon chips.</p><p>Google's partnership with Samsung underpins Wear OS's success, and staying in lockstep would make joint software development easier. <em>Or</em> it'll go all-in on RISC-V to try and differentiate its Pixel family from Samsung's. I can only speculate on which path Google will take; I <em>hope</em> it chooses the latter, simply because it would make the Pixel Watch 4 in 2025 more intriguing, while also worrying that Google will take the safer route.</p>
<h2 id="health-and-fitness-will-remain-a-primary-focus-2">Health and fitness will remain a primary focus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t64tqjPgwPtjWuQ8AKC73b" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-samsung-health-water-energy-score.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 showing water monitoring and energy scores in Samsung Health" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t64tqjPgwPtjWuQ8AKC73b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is such a safe bet that I won't spend too long dwelling on it. However, Wear OS 6 will continue Google and Samsung's quest to try to keep up with fitness rivals like Apple and Garmin.</p><p>A healthy portion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> and One UI 6 Watch updates focused on health features (e.g., sleep apnea / Energy Score / Cardio Load) and workout tools (e.g., AI coaching / running form analysis / pace or HR goals during workouts).</p><p>With Wear OS 6 watches, Google will hopefully add dual-band GPS like Samsung, as well as focus on other sports like cycling and weightlifting to complement its newfound running focus. Samsung will probably copy Google and Apple and implement some form of training load feature, showing the short- and long-term impact of workouts.</p><p>We could also see new health tools, but I'll remain skeptical of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">non-invasive blood glucose</a> until it happens, no matter how many times companies say they <em>want</em> to do it. And I don't know what other non-gimmicky data points these companies have left to add; maybe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-patent-shows-plans-to-monitor-mental-health">mental health</a> will be the next smartwatch focus.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-will-blow-up-on-smartwatches-2">Gemini will blow up on smartwatches</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L" name="google-gemini-hero-banner-wide.jpg" alt="Google Gemini brings "custom Gems" to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google spent 2024 cramming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> into every Google service and product that could support it, and ended the year promising that Gemini would be the baseline for its new smart glasses OS, Android XR. Even if I don't have any evidence, I'm fairly confident Google will make Gemini available with Wear OS 6 as a Pixel Watch 4 killer app — possibly a stripped-down version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>.</p><p>This assumes Google can take Gemini Nano — the "smallest" version for smartphone on-device AI tools — and port it down to work on a smartwatch processor. It might depend on what kind of power the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 can deliver, and could shut out current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> with last-gen hardware not designed for Gemini.</p><p>"On the Gemini front, I think Google still needs to figure out a way to get Gemini to run smoothly on such performance-limited hardware," Sag told me. "That could come with RISC-V or some other more capable platform." But he agreed that "right now I don't think Google Assistant performance is where it should be," and said that he could see AI becoming "the connective fabric between all of our wearables."</p><p>If I'm wrong that Gemini can be scaled down to wearable form, I still expect Google to add more AI-powered tricks to Wear OS in some form. For example, it could add its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-labs-insight-explorer-test-gemini-start">Fitbit Insight Explorer</a> to the Pixel Watch 4, so you could ask for context about your recent workouts — similar to Zepp Coach on Amazfit watches.</p><p>Samsung, which has always offered Bixby and Assistant, would also get access to Gemini. It recently unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-major-gen-ai-bixby-rework-arrives">Bixby AI</a> with LLM capabilities, but it's exclusive to Chinese phones for now; we don't know if it'd be ready by the Galaxy Watch 8. Still, One UI 6 Watch had plenty of AI tricks like Energy Score and auto-suggested replies, and Samsung will probably focus on other niche features, with a mix of cloud computing and on-device tricks.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In March 2024, SamMobile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">reported inside knowledge</a> that Samsung was "looking to bring back the squarish design for its smartwatches," with "enthusiastic" internal support for the plan. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> seemed the most likely candidate.</p><p>Samsung hasn't sold a squircle watch since the Gear S in 2014; although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> <em>looks</em> more square-shaped due to its titanium bezel, the display is still circular. At the time, some Galaxy Watch fans <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wants-square-galaxy-watch-again">resented the idea</a> of abandoning the traditional watch look for the squircle design so closely associated with Apple Watches.</p><p>I didn't mind the idea at the time and found the report plausible. But I recently remembered this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">August report</a> that Samsung chairman Lee Jae-yong allegedly lambasted the MX Division for "design plagiarism," with the Galaxy Watch Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds Pro 3</a> too similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> and AirPods Pro in features and looks.</p><p>Lee's "angry" response makes me doubt that Samsung's internal enthusiasm for squircles will make it onto a mainline Galaxy Watch. Even if Samsung designed a squircle watch before Samsung, most people would still see it as copying Apple, and that seems to be a sore spot for its chairman.</p><p>So don't be surprised if the Galaxy Watch 8 looks a lot like the last <em>four</em> Galaxy Watches: machine-cut, flat, and bezel-less. As for other models, we're due for our biannual Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and Samsung might keep selling the Ultra as is for another year before progressing to the Ultra 2 (or abandoning it like it did the Watch 5 Pro).</p>
<h2 id="wear-os-will-bring-back-facer-2">Wear OS will bring back Facer</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xpzJGSKNxSRtNCALZ9RDqF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-facer-pokemon.jpeg" alt="A custom Facer watch face showing two Pokemon cheering for you on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xpzJGSKNxSRtNCALZ9RDqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This may be nothing more than wishful thinking since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">Facer was one of my favorite Wear OS apps</a> before Google made the XML Watch Face Format the default on Wear OS 5 to extend battery life and left the decade-old app and its developers high and dry. But I want Facer back, and I think it'll happen in 2025.</p><p>Google won't go back on its restriction and let battery-guzzling faces back on Wear OS; they make the watches look short-lived for aesthetics. But its current solution — scrolling through a long list of watch faces in the Play Store without any organization — is terrible. Facer says it's "working hard with Google to solve this issue" and provide an alternative, and I believe them.</p><p>My guess is that Google will once again allow third-party apps to share watch faces to Wear OS as long as they're XML-coded, which would let Facer back onto new Wear OS watches — even if most of its 500,000 faces aren't compatible anymore. At the very least, fun XML watch faces would be much more findable on Facer, which would, in turn, incentivize developers to start <em>making</em> creative XML faces for us.</p>
<h2 id="my-less-reliable-2025-wear-os-predictions-2">My less reliable 2025 Wear OS predictions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nmdcQ593Sbg8a3GbAEY6hM" name="Wear-OS-watches-hero" alt="A pile of Wear OS watches: The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, 6, 6 Classic, and 5 Pro; the Google Pixel Watch 3 and 2; and the OnePlus Watch 2R." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmdcQ593Sbg8a3GbAEY6hM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I've reviewed a lot of Wear OS watches over the past few years, and I'm excited for what 2025 brings! </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of the above is certain, but I at least have evidence or solid reasons for speculating. Now I'll throw out my 2025 Wear OS predictions that aren't based on anything except vibes:</p><p>I won't be surprised if <strong>another Android OEM</strong> makes a Wear OS watch. Motorola, which once sold the Android Wear-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-360-review-0">Moto 360</a> but now focuses on budget Moto OS trackers, seems like a possible candidate.</p><p>I'm also worried about <strong>slower Wear OS updates</strong> in 2025. Admittedly, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/long-wear-os-5-update-delay-feels-like-bad-sign">has been a problem since Wear OS 3</a>, but I'm worried that brands like Mobvoi will really struggle with Wear OS 5 and keep selling Wear OS 4 watches in the interim. And with Wear OS 6, the gap between when new and last-gen watches get it could be even wider.</p><p>We could very well see the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-new-partnership-could-be-the-cure-for-wear-oss-health-data-headaches">Wear OS watch with <strong>Masimo health sensors</strong></a>, though it's possible that the hardware won't be ready to incorporate into watches until after 2025.</p><p>Lastly, I'll go out on a limb and guess that Google will <strong>make Fitbit available on all Wear OS watches in 2025</strong>. Even if it means losing that exclusivity for Pixel Watches, the data payoff would be worth it for them.</p>

Google and Samsung have their own methods of image AI image generation, so it's not surprising that Motorola also has a feature on select devices that lets you do just that.</p><p>Magic Canvas was initially just a way to generate images for wallpapers but has since evolved into something more capable. The feature, which is now part of Motorola's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> suite, is able to generate impressive images just by typing in a text prompt using various image styles. It works similarly to features like Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio app</a>, meaning owners of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a> don't have to miss out on the ability to create fun images they can use as wallpapers or share with friends.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-magic-canvas-2">How to use Magic Canvas</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Press and hold</strong> the home screen to bring up the customization menu.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Wallpapers</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Create with AI</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Magic Canvas</strong>. If you're not already, you may be prompted to sign into your <strong>Moto account</strong>. Tap it and follow the prompts to sign in or create an account, otherwise continue on to the next steps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="RrsakdTY9qwtSXcgZfEcvX" name="Moto-AI-Magic-Canvas-1" alt="Accessing Magic Canvas on a Motorola phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RrsakdTY9qwtSXcgZfEcvX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. <strong>Type a prompt</strong> into the Description box.</p><p>6. Select the desired <strong>aspect ratio</strong>. You can choose from 1:1 (square) or 9:16 (portrait orientation).</p><p>7. Select the desired <strong>Style</strong>. Options include Abstract, Cartoon, Fantasy, Futuristic, Impressionist, Minimalist, Pop Art, Realistic, Surreal, and Vintage.</p><p>8. Tap <strong>Generate Image</strong> and wait for the image to finish generating. This should take several seconds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="RnN9PrbCBC9xZnyAeXkubX" name="Moto-AI-Magic-Canvas-2" alt="Generating an image with Magic Canvas" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RnN9PrbCBC9xZnyAeXkubX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once the image is generated, you can save it to your gallery, copy it to use later, share it, or set the image as a wallpaper. If you don't like the result, you can tap Redo, and Magic Canvas will generate another version of the image based on your prompt.</p>
<h2 id="get-creating-with-limits-2">Get creating, with limits</h2>
<p>Magic Canvas is a fun tool that lets you run wild with your imagination, allowing you to create fun and unique images on the fly. However, there are limits to the types of images you can create. Magic Canvas may not generate some images if it's perceived to be a sensitive topic, and you'll be met with a warning if you try to generate such images.</p><p>Furthermore, any image created with Magic Canvas will have a watermark in the bottom left corner that reads "AI Generated Image." It may not be as flashy as the watermark on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>-generated images, but it should get the job done to ensure the image is properly tagged.</p><p>Lastly, Magic Canvas is not available on every Motorola phone. The feature appears to be limited to higher-end devices, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr</a> series and Edge 50 series. To check if your phone has Magic Canvas, follow the first couple of steps in this guide to see if it appears in the "Create with AI" section of the Wallpaper settings menu.</p>

The decision ultimately came down to durability, as the dual-curved edges made phones more susceptible to damage if the device was ever dropped. Even so, that shouldn't result in a less comfortable phone, as OnePlus went through many different iterations, with the goal being "for the transition surfaces to better conform to the natural curve of the user's palm while also providing a secure grip," Ruan said.</p><p>OnePlus also worked for over a year on the microfiber leather to ensure it was comfortable and durable. And speaking of durability, you won't find Gorilla Glass on the OnePlus 13, but a custom Ceramic Guard solution, which Ruan says delivers "superior drop protection and scratch resistance."</p><p>Be sure to check out the interview for more on the OnePlus 13 design. The phone is set to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-confirms-the-oneplus-13-global-launch-date">launch on January 7</a> alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13r-is-a-thin-midranger-with-a-6-000mah-battery-arriving-january-7">OnePlus 13R</a>.</p>

A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20241222000037">ETNews</a> reveals that Samsung may have adjusted its shipments for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Z Flip 7</a> to a total of 5 million units in 2025, down a few million compared to 2024.

This figure includes the rumored Galaxy S25 Slim, which the report notes is expected to ship roughly 3 million units.</p><p>Curiously, this report doesn't mention anything about additional foldable models, with Samsung expected to reveal a sequel to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>.

This would be used to show text, like notifications, as well as images and possibly responses from the Meta AI assistant.</p><p>The new glasses will be designed by Meta's partner, EssilorLuxottica, although there's not much information on the wearables.</p><p>Meta has been working on AR glasses, as evidenced by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Project Orion</a> prototype it showed us earlier this year. Putting a display on the next-generation Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses would bring the company closer to fully realizing its goal, although the Orion glasses are likely still years away.</p>

<p>One of the biggest trends in 2025 <em>could</em> be the rise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. Manufacturers are pushing the boundaries of smartphone design, offering devices that seamlessly transition between phone and tablet modes.

If that doesn't happen, we'll have the same market players doing the same things, and consumers will continue to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-foldable-market-share-q1-2024">largely ignore foldable phones</a>.</p>

<p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-explained">expectations of 5G</a> were wrong. We don't have blazing-fast network speeds on our phones everywhere and all of the time, and the way the tech works, we never will. Still, 5G has lived up to its promise in other ways, especially when it comes to the backbone that powers everything. It will continue to quietly expand in 2025.</p><p>The widespread deployment of 5G networks is transforming the way we interact with our devices. 5G offers significantly faster speeds, lower latency, and greater capacity, enabling a new era of mobile experiences:</p><p><strong>Cloud Gaming:</strong> 5G empowers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-geforce-now-review">cloud gaming</a> services, allowing users to stream high-quality games without the need for powerful hardware on both mobile devices and laptops.</p><p><strong>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR):</strong> 2025 will not be the year of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-project-iris-rumor">AR/VR</a> everywhere, but 5G will continue to make the experience better. 5G's high bandwidth and low latency are essential for immersive AR and VR experiences.</p><p><strong>Remote Work and Learning:</strong> 5G facilitates seamless remote work and online learning by enabling high-quality video conferencing and fast file transfers. As the technology rollout continues, more people — especially in rural areas — have access to acceptable internet. That's important, and it will continue to get better.</p>

<p>Environmental consciousness is driving a shift towards <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones">sustainable mobile tech</a>. Manufacturers are focusing on eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient designs, and responsible manufacturing practices. Additionally, initiatives to extend the lifespan of devices and reduce electronic waste are gaining traction.</p><p>Phone makers know this has to happen. There is a finite amount of materials available, and as they become more scarce, they also become more expensive. Recycled materials and sustainable manufacturing are the future, and I think we'll see more companies making an actual difference in 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>Bad software updates are never anybody's idea of fun, and several Meta Quest owners found this out in the worst way possible when turning on their headsets after Christmas this year.</p><p>The Meta Quest v72 update appears to have rendered some Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> headsets unusable after it failed to install. Owners who received the faulty update headed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Talk-VR/NOT-SOLVED-Unacceptable-Response-to-Software-Update-Breaking/td-p/1273736">Meta forums</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/bricked-quest-report-christmas-2024/">UploadVR</a>) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1hmh09n/quest_update_possibly_bricking_headsets/">Reddit</a> to report that their headsets wouldn't boot. Affected users' headsets show a black screen with the error "Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted."</p><p>Meta advises that affected users hold down the power button for 45 seconds before booting up, which should reset the headset and potentially clear out any problems. Users can also try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILG7H4KSFJk">manually flashing the V71 update</a> using Meta's official manual update tool and a smartphone.</p><p>Some users have reported that these steps do not resolve the issue. Meta says the offending update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Announcements/Quest-2-3S-3-Software-Update-Issue/ba-p/1277634">has been officially fixed</a> and that users who are still experiencing problems should contact customer support through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/support/?b=quest">Meta Quest help center</a>.

Not all customer service representatives appear to have received the news, however, so customers who aren't offered a free replacement headset are encouraged to request their ticket to be escalated.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta pulled the offending update and is offering free replacement headsets for affected customers, although not all customer service reps seem to have gotten the message.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Some retailers may offer exchanges for a defective unit. If you received one for the holidays, check with the store it was purchased from to see if you can exchange it for another unit, or wait for Meta's official solution if this is not possible.</p><p>Based on publicly available data <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=meta+quest+3&crid=1XGWPUT0MXIWH&sprefix=meta+quest+3%2Caps%2C97&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">via Amazon</a>, Meta sold three times as many Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S headsets as Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and Series S combined. We don't yet know how widespread the update issue is but we do know that Meta <em>always</em> rolls out updates and features slowly to its headsets to prevent widespread issues like this.</p><p>Given how well Meta's Quest headsets performed this holiday season, there's a possibility that a large number of customers have been affected. If you have been affected, Meta is encouraging users to go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Announcements/bg-p/AnnouncementsBlog">this Meta Quest announcement page</a>, tap the options button in the top right, and then click subscribe. You'll need a Meta Quest forum account to do this, but creating one is free and as simple as logging in with your existing Meta account.</p>

<ul><li>Apple is seeking to defend its deal with Google, which provides revenue sharing through Search.</li><li>This comes after the DOJ threatened to break up Google's business after a court found that it holds an illegal monopoly.</li><li>Google has since proposed its own remedies to satisfy the court, arguing that its extreme measures could result in a worse product for consumers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's recent legal troubles have taken an interesting turn, as Apple has made a motion to participate in an upcoming hearing to defend the company and their joint Search deal (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-seeks-defend-googles-billion-dollar-payments-search-case-2024-12-24/">Reuters</a>). This follows a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">proposal by the DOJ</a> to break up Google's business by potentially selling Chrome and prohibiting search distribution agreements with companies like Apple.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zgvoalybovd/apple%20declaration.pdf">Apple's declaration</a> explains why its deal with Google is beneficial to both companies and that the DOJ's proposed remedies to prevent such a deal would do more harm than good. Apple states that setting Google Search as the default search engine on Safari provides a better experience for users and that removing it would "hamstring Apple's ability to continue delivering products that best serve its users' needs," adding that its customers "prefer Google."</p><p>Apple receives billions from Google per year through the ad-sharing deal ($20 billion in 2022). The company argues that prohibiting such a deal would either give Google free access to its customers' data or Apple would have to remove Search as the default engine on its browser, which it says would provide a potentially worse experience for its users.</p><p>Cupertino also argues that the DOJ's proposed remedy assumed that Apple is even interested in developing its own search engine, which it says it's not. According to Apple, doing so would take considerable time, money, and resources for something that isn't part of Apple's core business.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/apple-moves-to-fight-us-effort-to-upend-search-deals-with-google">Bloomberg</a>, a hearing for proposals is set to happen in April.</p><p>Following the ruling earlier this year that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">Google holds an illegal search monopoly</a>, the search giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calls-out-the-doj-for-its-extreme-plan-to-break-up-its-search-business">lambasted the DOJ's "extreme" proposal</a> while countering with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-files-counter-doj-chrome-proposal">remedies of its own</a>. This includes additional flexibility for partners when choosing default search engines across devices. OEMs would also have flexibility in preloading multiple search engines, which Google says could give "rivals like Microsoft more chances to bid for placement."</p><p>And while Google believes its proposal would address the court's findings, the company still seems reluctant to implement these remedies, as it would "impose burdensome restrictions" on its partners.</p>

<p>You might think it's premature to compare Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS, given that we won't see any Android XR headsets until 2025 at the earliest. But based on everything Google has explained about Android XR's features, hardware, <em>and</em> software, it's remarkable how similar these two operating systems will be.</p><p>Unlike Apple with its productivity-focused Vision Pro, Google and Samsung have said they intend to make gaming a central tenet of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, meaning they'll have to challenge gaming headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><p>Otherwise, Google's software plans for XR headsets, AR glasses, and smart glasses all directly oppose Meta, the established or aspiring rival in each category. The big question will be whether Google is willing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q2-2024-earnings">lose billions</a> on XR development the way Meta has been or if it'll kill Android XR like so many other initiatives if it's unprofitable.</p><p>We should see a major influx of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> from Google and Meta's partners, running either Android XR or Meta Horizon OS. We'll be following developments closely for both, but if you're weighing buying your next XR purchase for gaming, productivity, or development, this guide will run through what to expect with either operating system.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os-hardware-and-controls-2">Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Hardware and controls</h2>
<p>Meta Quest headsets depend on Snapdragon chips, optimized to run graphics-heavy programs and a dozen sensors or cameras at once. Meta itself said that the Snapdragon XR2 series is "tightly integrated with our software and hardware stacks" and that Horizon OS partners will benefit from their "long-term partnership with Qualcomm."</p><p>Google <em>also</em> "collaborated" directly with Qualcomm when designing Android XR, which is unsurprising given its specialization in the XR space. It specifically declared the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</a> as the backbone behind upcoming Android XR headsets. Qualcomm will make its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-spaces">Snapdragon Spaces</a> XR platform fully compatible with Android XR, and they are "focused on helping to build and scale the Android XR ecosystem."</p><p>We expect the performance level for Google and Meta headsets (or their partner brands) to be very similar and dependent upon which generation of Snapdragon SoC they use. The main differences will come down to specific partners' hardware choices, like the cameras, controllers, and amount of RAM.</p>

<p>Based on everything Google has said or shown about Android XR, the operating system can support controller tracking, hand tracking, eye tracking, and voice-controlled commands. So, any given Android XR headset or glasses could ship without controllers and rely solely on pinching and showing information where you're looking; otherwise, they can support proper gaming controllers. It's all up to the OEM.</p><p>Meta supports all of these controller options through the Meta Horizon OS. It hasn't offered eye tracking on a headset since the defunct <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Quest Pro</a>, but we suspect Meta may re-add eye tracking to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> since Apple and Google are both making it a point of emphasis.</p><p>There isn't too much else to say about hardware until we try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> or Google's smart glasses for ourselves. Meta's Quest headsets are well known for their strengths — affordability, lightweight and wireless design, reliable tracking — and weaknesses — battery life and the need for comfort upgrades.</p>

<p>Meta Horizon OS has changed its name a couple of times (starting with Oculus), but it's the proprietary OS behind its Quest headsets. In April 2024, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">opened up Horizon OS</a> to third parties, announcing that Lenovo and ASUS ROG would make a productivity and gaming headset, respectively, with the same OS and software as first-party Quests. Meta also intends to make a Quest "inspired by Xbox" in partnership with Microsoft. We don't know yet when these devices will arrive.</p><p>Based on our demo with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> and our time wearing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, they share many of the same OS tools and AI tricks as the Quest headsets. So, we think it's fair to lump them into the same Meta Horizon OS umbrella.</p><p>While Meta took years to open up its system to others, Google is making Android XR available to other brands from the start without its own (public) hardware plans. Google developed Android XR in tandem with Samsung, which will sell its mixed-reality headset — codenamed Project Moohan — in 2025. Google has its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">smart glasses prototype</a>, but we don't know if they'll ever be available to consumers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Concept render of Samsung's Project Moohan </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google also has other partners who plan to sell Android XR devices: Xreal, Sony, and Lynx. Sony already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-announces-high-end-xr-headset-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro">announced its mixed-reality headset</a> at CES 2024, and Xreal previously hinted that it intended to make its glasses compatible with a multimodal AI on your phone, meaning Google Gemini.</p><p>Google has explicitly said Android XR will work for AR and smart glasses. Meta announced Horizon OS as "our open mixed reality ecosystem" and did not mention glasses, so it may not intend to share its software with anyone targeting this form factor — or at least not yet.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os-software-games-and-apps-2">Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Software, games, and apps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VimKDKShuDZe9icGaoqDRT" name="Meta-Quest-3S-mixed-reality-gameplay-starship-home.jpg" alt="Viewing my living room in mixed reality as a starship in Starship Home through the lenses of a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VimKDKShuDZe9icGaoqDRT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta regularly updates its devices with new software features, but it does so by device: the Meta Quest is on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/whats-new/release-notes">v72</a> as of December 2024, while the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/smart-glasses/articles/release-notes/smart-glasses-release-notes">v11</a>. It's not clear how Meta will handle feature updates for third-party headsets, but it <em>is</em> clear that they update things quickly rather than wait for annual updates.</p><p>It's also fair to point out that Meta's software is highly focused on gaming. It has a few 2D progressive web apps (PWAs) since it can't use traditional App or Play Store apps, but only a few big-name apps like YouTube, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and a few streaming apps with basic VR theater modes. For the most part, you'll be spending your time in the Quest browser.</p><p>On the gaming front, every VR or MR developer focuses on the Quest first and foremost since that's where the money is. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Quest games</a> list and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Quest games</a> list should show just how much content there is available — and third-party Meta Horizon OS headsets will get that same content, from virtual experiences to mixed-reality titles that make your living room visible.</p><p>Admittedly, developers are annoyed with Meta at the moment over its mess of an app store, which spends more real estate highlighting the Horizon app over new games. So, if Google provides a better alternative and makes porting games easy, we're sure some developers will jump on board. The question is whether gamers will follow and move over to either Samsung or any other Android XR partner when their current gaming library is on the Quest.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the Android XR front, Google is promising app developers an easy pipeline to their apps appearing on their headsets. It supports "ARCore, Android Studio, Jetpack Compose, Unity, and OpenXR," and there is already substantial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/get-started">documentation</a> for devs to start using the Android XR SDK.</p><p>Google says any current Play Store developer can "opt in" to Android XR and have their app "just work" because of this built-in compatibility. But we assume this would simply mean that the app works as a 2D window in virtual space, not that it'll have any XR optimization. And it's not clear how many major developers <em>will</em> opt into Android XR, based on the difficulties Apple had getting Vision Pro buy-in.</p><p>So far, only a few third-party apps like Adobe, Calm, and MLB have officially signed on. However, even a tiny fraction of the Play Store's app collection would give Google the edge. It also has the advantage of its own apps: being able to include Google Drive and Gmail gives an automatic edge for productivity users. Chrome is a more popular and polished browser option than Meta's, and YouTube and Google TV will provide popular streaming options.</p><p>Plus, Google has the ability to fully sync its Android XR software with your other Android devices, specifically your phone. Just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> benefit from close synchronization for functions like messaging, Android XR headsets and glasses could have functions that Meta can't offer as easily.</p><p>Google has promised full gaming support for Android XR, and many Quest games use OpenXR, allowing for cross-platform compatibility. However, the built-in Quest audience will make it a higher priority for developers, and the specter of Stadia's failure could make gaming developers leery about investing too much time in the platform.</p>

At the moment, both are as prone to hallucinations and misinformation as any other AI.</p><p>In the short term, headsets like Project Moohan and the Quest 3 will <em>offer</em> AI tools, but they won't be the device's focus. Most people are still buying XR headsets for gaming, and you don't need AI for that. It's when we start to see more smart & AR glasses for <em>outdoor</em> use that the AI will really matter, in our opinion.</p><p>Google has said that the "Gemini era" is why Android XR will succeed where past Google VR and AR projects, so whether or not you get invested in the platform may depend on whether you think Gemini will be <em>smart enough</em> to be a real-time multimodal assistant in the next few years.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os-can-google-make-a-name-for-itself-2">Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Can Google make a name for itself?</h2>
<p>Android XR has the potential to become the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">most exciting version of Android in years</a>. However, so much of its potential depends on how well partners like Samsung take advantage of it. Samsung is one of the most popular tech brands in the world, and its hardware and software knowledge helped revive Wear OS from metaphorical life support, but Samsung and Google are both in the business of making money, and XR has historically proven to be difficult to profit from. Just ask Meta!</p><p>We can also look at the example of the Apple Vision Pro, which has a gorgeous design, excellent UI, and opt-in apps from its App Store but has largely failed to make a huge impact. It's in part because of its overpriced headset but also because the audience for a wearable productivity device is relatively small.</p><p>Samsung will have to compete with the established Meta Horizon brand on the gaming front or hope that it can do better than Apple at a lower price point. And if any Android XR brand hopes to sell AR glasses, they'll have to deal with the simple fact that they seem <em>extremely</em> difficult to create in a lightweight, functional form factor.</p><p>All of that is to say; Android XR seems to have some factors stacked against it while also having the advantage over Meta's rival OS in key areas like apps and a full device ecosystem. We're excited to see whether or not Android XR lives long enough to truly make a difference in the XR industry!</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="j694D5wu5mdb9MzUKqC72V" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-look-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="An angled, rumored rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j694D5wu5mdb9MzUKqC72V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung doesn't like changing its design, with the last three iterations in this series looking largely identical. If leaked renders are any indication, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25</a> will have the same design as its predecessor, with boxy sides and a glass back. The design is characterized by a minimal camera module; each individual sensor is housed within a ring, and that's about it.</p><p>This design leads to a cleaner look at the back, and having used devices with overly large camera modules like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, it is refreshing. There isn't much else to talk about in this area; the Galaxy S25 is notable because of its smaller size, with Samsung likely to retain the same dimensions as its predecessor. That should make it good to hold and use, and while we don't have details on color variants just yet, there's a good possibility that Samsung will have at least one new color.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JwFaqb8hAoHm2gLccGk9r5" name="iphone-16-pro-max-9.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max side view with power button and Camera Control" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JwFaqb8hAoHm2gLccGk9r5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the subject of unchanging designs, the iPhone 16 Pro looks identical to its predecessor, which was the same as its predecessor, and so on. Basically, we've had the same design for quite a while now, and if nothing else, it is familiar.</p><p>Also familiar is the camera module at the back; the square housing is distinctive like no other, and even though the design is several years old by this point, it still looks great. The iPhone 16 Pro's flat profile is similar to previous years, but there are slight bevels this time around that make holding and using the phone that much better.</p><p>What's new is the camera control button that's located on the right; while this is an interesting addition, I don't really use it much, and the location makes it awkward to access when using the cameras on the device.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro comes with IP68 ingress protection as standard, and it is the only device that can be submerged in up to six meters of water — all other phones can only be immersed in 1.5 meters. While it's unclear what Samsung will do in this area, it is a good possibility that the Galaxy S25 will also get an IP68, just like its predecessors. Other Android devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and Vivo X200 Pro include IP69 protection as well, but I don't see Samsung going that route just yet.</p>

<p>Samsung went back to using Exynos designs with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a>, but if a recent leak is to be believed, the Galaxy S25 series will once again go back to using Qualcomm exclusively, just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a>, although rumors have been going back and forth on this matter.</p><p>If true, this should give the Galaxy S25 a distinct edge, as Qualcomm is clearly onto a winner this year. By switching to custom cores with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and a node shift to 3nm, Qualcomm is delivering sizeable gains in all key areas, and I'm excited to see how it holds up on the Galaxy S25.</p><p>Of course, this is contingent on Samsung actually using Qualcomm exclusively — we'll only know once the S25 is official. In other areas, the device is likely to be unchanged from its predecessor, but it should hopefully get 12GB of RAM as standard on all models, with Samsung moving away from 8GB base memory (as we've seen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>). This is necessitated by all the AI-backed features coming to phones these days, and with Samsung leaning heavily on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, it's understandable that the brand is going with 12GB next year for better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> capabilities.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro has one of the best hardware packages in the industry, and there are no issues in daily use. The A18 Pro continues to deliver incredible performance, and it is particularly great at gaming; it manages to run console-quality games without any lag or jitter, and that's a considerable achievement. While Android hardware is just as good these days, you don't get the same caliber of games as iOS.</p><p>Even with a smaller battery, the iPhone 16 Pro manages to last a day without any issues, but the biggest issue in this area continues to be slow charging tech. It takes over an hour and a half to charge the device, and that's just too long in 2024. In a similar vein, the Galaxy S25 isn't likely to see any advancements in this regard, with Samsung set to use its 25W charging tech.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="jTuL4F5XvGz7EbCj29S7NE" name="S24-Camera.jpg" alt="S24 Camera deck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jTuL4F5XvGz7EbCj29S7NE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, the one area where there's a considerable difference is the cameras; the iPhone 16 Pro has the same main camera as last year, but you get a new 48MP wide-angle lens, and changes to the tuning means you get much better photos. The ability to change the color balance dynamically gives you significantly greater control in selecting the way resultant shots look, and it transformed how I use the device.</p><p>Samsung is set to change the cameras on the S25, and we might see the same module as the S25 Ultra this time around, which is exciting. Again, we'll have to wait a little while to learn all about the camera tech coming to the device, but given that the S24 and even the S23 didn't offer any meaningful gains, we're due for an upgrade.</p>

The Android 15-based interface doesn't have many new features, but you get Samsung's usual utilities, and Galaxy AI continues to be the differentiator.</p><p>In a similar vein, iOS 18 doesn't have much in the way of new features either, with Apple Intelligence taking center stage. I think iOS is in need of a visual overhaul, but given its sizeable user base, it's unlikely Apple will make any massive changes to the software design.</p><p>Samsung has a distinct advantage when it comes to updates, with the Galaxy S25 set to offer at least seven guaranteed Android OS updates like its predecessors.

<p>With the Galaxy S25 likely launching in January, you may not have to wait long if you're looking to upgrade your phone. The phone should slot in at the same $899 price point as the S24, and Samsung always has attractive trade-in deals, making it easier to switch to the device.</p><p>The leaks suggest the Galaxy S25 isn't going to differ too much from what we got last year, and that's by design. Samsung is instead positioning its AI software suite and cameras as the main points of differentiation, and that strategy should be unchanged in 2025.</p><p>I'd suggest getting the iPhone 16 Pro if you're interested in seeing what iOS has to offer. The phone has a reliable design, terrific hardware, outstanding cameras, and hassle-free software. The switch to USB-C connectivity makes it easier than ever to switch to the iPhone, and if you're within the Google ecosystem, all your services work just as well on iOS.</p>

AYANEO is one of the companies leading the way in this regard. However, it's taking a slightly different approach by releasing Android handhelds in a variety of form factors, such as the AYANEO Pocket Micro.</p><p>AYANEO attempts to entice those who love devices that invoke some type of nostalgia, with the Pocket Micro looking to cater to multiple factions. The most obvious of which is by making a handheld that draws inspiration from the original NES controller.</p><p>However, what you might not know is that the Pocket Micro's 3.5-inch screen offers a perfect 4x scaling for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-boy-game-boy-advance-emulators-android">Game Boy Advance games</a>. Which is something that's a bit of a rarity in the space. All the while, relying on Android to power the system, which opens the floodgates to a swath of games for you to choose from. And while all of that sounds great, it's important to keep things in perspective and not let the wave of nostalgia tiny your glasses any more than they already might be.</p>

<p>AYANEO announced the Pocket Micro alongside the Pocket DMG all the way back in May with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-dmg-pocket-micro-launch">pre-orders opening</a> in July. The Pocket Micro was the first to become available, as shipments began in late September in limited quantities before things picked up in October.</p><p>Currently, you can purchase the AYANEO Pocket Micro through the Indiegogo campaign, with a starting price of $189 for the 6GB/128GB model. There's also an 8GB/256GB version available for $229, and a Limited Edition "Retro Gray" variant can be had for $259. We expect the Pocket Micro to soon be made available on the AYANEO website before it comes to other online retailers.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="22fss4KUUE7r7aPgHb9Lz5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket Micro next to LEGO NES Controller playing Super Mario Bros." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/22fss4KUUE7r7aPgHb9Lz5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something that I have to pay attention to whenever I'm interested in getting a new gaming handheld is the ergonomics. I probably have a bit of carpal tunnel, meaning that with some handhelds, I can only play games for <em>maybe</em> 30 minutes before I need to take a break. It varies between handhelds and actually resulted in me investing in a few grips for my Nintendo Switch.</p><p>When I saw that the Pocket Micro was basically a brick, I was pretty worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy it. Much to my surprise, that hasn't been too much of an issue, and I can't really seem to figure out why. The flat edges paired with the flat back and smaller size means that I end up holding it differently than other handhelds.</p><p>As a result, the hand and wrist fatigue doesn't actually start settling until I'm about an hour or so into a gaming session. While it's far from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-vs-steam-deck-lcd-what-are-the-differences">Steam Deck OLED</a> or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a>, the Pocket Micro is more enjoyable to use than I expected.</p>

<p>If there's one thing you should be aware of, it's that this thing is hefty. AYANEO has it listed at 233 grams, which is even heavier than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> (227g), and barely lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> (239g). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially when you realize <em>why</em> it's so heavy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="85MTiwnLHijicFFx6Qweo5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-10" alt="Logo and ventilation on back of the AYANEO Pocket Micro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/85MTiwnLHijicFFx6Qweo5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's because, in addition to melding glass and aluminum, AYANEO packed Active Cooling into the Pocket Micro. It did so in order to keep both the device and your hands, from getting too warm. With a device this compact, heat dissipation is key because if the heat has nowhere to go, it won't take long for throttling to begin.</p><p>Speaking of performance, it's important to temper your expectations. Unlike the AYANEO Pocket DMG and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">Pocket S</a>, the Micro is powered by the MediaTek Helio G99 from 2022. I can only assume this chip is at the helm because it's cheaper, which is rather important when you're talking about a premium handheld.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="df6z4cHt2Jtc39BeKa8fv5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-2" alt="AYANEO Pocket Micro next to LEGO NES Set playing Super Mario Bros." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/df6z4cHt2Jtc39BeKa8fv5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although it's almost three years old, the Helio G99 has turned into a kind of "old reliable" SoC for various tablets and other devices. That being said, you'll be able to play many, if not all, of your favorite games from the Play Store. In terms of emulation, you'll start hitting the ceiling once you get into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">PS2 and GameCube</a> games.</p><p>Part of that is helped by AYANEO offering configurations with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM, but the software also has different performance profiles to help push things further. I couldn't help myself from at least trying to load up some Switch games, unsurprisingly those efforts proved to be fruitless.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ayaneo-pocket-micro-what-i-don-t"><span>AYANEO Pocket Micro: What I don't</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ntxzcqcPAgijX2i8LaAYs5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-16" alt="Close-up of fly-out menu on AYANEO Pocket Micro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ntxzcqcPAgijX2i8LaAYs5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without a doubt, my biggest irritation with the Pocket Micro was the software experience. Naturally, real estate is at a premium when you have a 3.5-inch screen to work with. But AYANEO's in-house launcher just doesn't cut. Everything is super small, and while I could just adjust the display scaling settings, that's not really something that I want to do.</p><p>Thankfully, there are gaming-focused launchers available, which quickly remedy my issues. Well, at least for the most part. There's nothing I can do to replace the slide-out panel that gives you quick access to various options. But seeing as I don't really mess with those often, it hasn't been much of an issue.</p><p>Instead, I've been bouncing between Emulation Station (ES-DE), Daijisho, and an alpha build of Console Launcher 2.0. If you really wanted to, you could even use something like Nova Launcher or Lawnchair, but where's the fun in that?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1908px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VRsifiwDjYXLBBMc98aZj5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-5" alt="Top-down view of AYANEO Pocket Micro and SMB 25th Anniversary Nintendo DSi XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VRsifiwDjYXLBBMc98aZj5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1908" height="1073" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My other issue with the Pocket Micro isn't something that everyone will have to deal with, but it's something to keep in mind. While I commend AYANEO for offering a gaming handheld that's both pocketable and premium, actually playing games might become a problem.</p><p>Although the ergonomics of the Pocket Micro are a bit better than some of the other gaming handhelds, I really do wish I could play for longer than an hour at a time. While I appreciate the nostalgic design, it might have been nice to see AYANEO offer some type of ergonomic grip.</p><p>That's what the company did with the Pocket S, as the "Protective Case" not only keeps the handheld protected but provides a more comfortable experience. Because of that, I've started changing the different positions that I'm holding the Micro, just so that I can keep playing. But ultimately, the best remedy was just to stop playing for a bit until my hands and/or wrists felt better.</p><p>Again, this isn't something that is going to cause issues for some, but it's worth being aware of if you have meaty paws and are considering the Micro.</p>

<p>The world of dedicated Android handhelds continues to expand, and AYANEO is one company that's leading the charge. However, it's not the only option on the block, as there are quite a few Android gaming handhelds to choose from.</p><p>In November, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld">Retroid Pocket 5</a> was released, which is the highly-anticipated successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Retroid-Pocket-Emulators-RP4-Pro/dp/B0CTHDZ57G/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HG46S4VOBZVS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HMo8MLny8w-HL2kVjxXcZlm3qUuAL0PTldHfhURT4xRdm9Z81YNBNwW9ZPY2fmgM8SyfWiFy6qiPpJQ2_rKSsCTQM6vUaE-K8jUUkKSGmfAhcKRLhrKwi5jKPsuxhZs_eRFcfx5MaC0feH3Msg4A2tz2VjSDr8fBG6_IGEMlv1X8lrdvynqUqlkCGEca_2o5smhTA4dAqPww8LBPX3nlGXh0QAvzkoBmLE4h1Rszj5h3L_1DLCJwRWqCGNvmARoKHkyfK-TRPPmBnk6mmlNBEe2UgqEPyt-Og3GRfX-JKAuoM33k1txsMm2wog4SNIJ6hWSuzYkED0-WecYRRcVphGOwnw6rw30MVYHPfev0gcvMWvnuF09ifdm1vJHbbEtqGcAcJ_jTRbooGrGBpa_nHO1UXnR4m_pSoQYYRZOYAYxsnZ6B1qtFCoeYMPEeX1hr.0DA-ibrEUsQ4x_MhcQV2qx-7L-QM6xUpUhVgLlLuGVc&dib_tag=se&keywords=retroid%2Bpocket%2B4%2Bpro&qid=1735076654&sprefix=retroid%2Bpocket%2B4%2Bpro%2Caps%2C89&sr=8-1&th=1">Retroid Pocket 4 Pro</a> from January 2024. The Pocket 5 features a 5.5-inch AMOLED display, while being powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage.</p><p>Then there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Processor-Emulator-Supports-Bluetooth-Streaming/dp/B0DN1L8LD6/">Anbernic RG406H</a>, which also arrived in November, and is equipped with the Unisoc Tiger T820, along with a smaller 4-inch IPS touchscreen. Anbernic is well-known in the world of retro handhelds, however, the company tends to focus more on Linux-based devices. That being said, the RG406H is an absolute delight to use, as long as you understand that the T820 isn't the most powerful chip.</p><p>If you're looking for a handheld from a company that you recognize, then you'll probably want to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whoa-the-razer-edge-just-dropped-to-its-lowest-price-ever-in-this-last-minute-black-friday-deal">Razer Edge</a>. This was of the first dedicated Android handhelds to be released by a mainstream company, powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 1. Although Razer has yet to release a successor, the Edge remains incredibly versatile, and it's regularly on sale for around $215.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want an Android handheld that looks like an NES controller with a screen.</li><li>You're a sucker for premium devices.</li><li>You're looking for a way to play retro and modern games on a pocketable device.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget.</li><li>You have concerns about ergonomics.</li><li>You want a handheld that's more powerful.</li></ul>
<p>Frankly, I already have my fair share of Android handhelds, not to mention a variety of foldable phones at my disposal. That being said, there's just something about playing games on the Pocket Micro that sparks a bit of joy every time I pick it up. Sure, it's not as powerful as other devices, but very few of them manage to pair a premium design with a retro aesthetic in the same way.</p><p>At the same time, it's really tough to recommend the Pocket Micro to anyone who isn't a retro gaming enthusiast. The almost-$200 price tag might just be too much for some, especially when more powerful handhelds can be had for around the same price. It's really just a matter of considering the trade-offs when trying to decide between the Pocket Micro and whatever else might be on your radar.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When I wrote a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-chromeos-wishlist-2024">similar piece</a> to this one last year, there was a bit more excitement in the air. Google had just introduced its Chromebook Plus moniker, which has seemingly proven to be a success. But as I reflect on the months past, that sense of excitement has turned into a bit of unease.</p><p>I have a similar feeling when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> but to a lesser extent. With a few exceptions, not really much has changed when looking at the overall landscape. Samsung is still at the top but has seemingly shifted its focus to more budget-friendly solutions. Meanwhile, other tablets were released that are trying to make a dent in an increasingly stagnant market.</p><p>None of this is to say that there's nothing to be excited about, but seeing how everything played out, my expectations have definitely shifted. Even still, there are a few things that I would love to see out of both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> and tablets as we get ready to kick off the new year.</p>

<h2 id="more-storage-please-2">More storage please</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JByWPaeinqfw3jo8Ar8bjM" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-16.jpg" alt="Cloud storage settings on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JByWPaeinqfw3jo8Ar8bjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The logical part of my brain understands that not very many people actually care about having different storage options in Chromebooks. Most of the time, you'll be using this while connected to the internet anyway, so you can just rely on Google Drive or another cloud storage solution to store files.</p><p>But when I look at a device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> and see that it only has 128GB of non-upgradeable storage, I'm a bit disappointed. Samsung tries to offset storage concerns by including a microSD card slot, but this isn't the case with every Chromebook.</p><p>Frankly, it's just disappointing to see, and it's something that I hope is rectified in some capacity. At this rate, I'd just be happy to see a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/framework-laptop-chromebook-edition-review">Framework Laptop Chromebook</a>, which gives me all of the flexibility I could want in a Chromebook.</p>
<h2 id="flagship-arm-chips-2">Flagship ARM chips</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="sCg7SvA6CCjop2aBwy8b5L" name="acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-with-snapdragon-x-elite.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023) with Snapdragon X Elite promo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCg7SvA6CCjop2aBwy8b5L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1165" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As soon as I heard about Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series of chips, I immediately thought about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-new-wave-of-chromebooks">how great it would be for Chromebooks</a>. For one, there are a few different processors within the series designed to hit various budgets and price points. At the same time, offering a balance of performance and battery life that we still long for with Chromebooks.</p><p>Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed not to see a single Snapdragon X-powered Chromebook announced before the end of the year. I was hoping that we would have at least seen <em>one</em>, even if it was just a teaser ahead of CES 2025. Unfortunately, that hasn't come to fruition, and I've all but given up on the idea of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">Chromebook powered by Google's Tensor chip</a>.</p>
<h2 id="smaller-flagship-tablets-2">Smaller flagship tablets</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9tSsL2fuZpMoavesmexrEj" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open mirrored on OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tSsL2fuZpMoavesmexrEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even if I didn't write about tablets as part of my job, I'd still use them all of the time. It's part of why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> are so important to me since they're basically mini tablets that can be folded in half and stuck in a pocket. Gone are the days of needing JNCO jeans whenever you're heading out and want to bring a tablet with you.</p><p>So when I say that I hope to see more "smaller" flagship tablets, I'm not even talking about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> or RedMagic Nova. I mean even smaller, something around the size of the Nexus 7, if not a little bit larger. OnePlus and RedMagic are filling the void left by Samsung's decision to forgo the 11-inch Galaxy Tab S10. Outside of that, if you want a compact flagship tablet, your best bet is to import something like the Lenovo Legion Y700.</p><p>Imagine having a tablet that you can comfortably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/we-need-smaller-flagship-android-tablets">hold in one hand</a> and use for everything and anything. Yes, Amazon's Fire Tablets still exist, but those are cheap and lack the performance that I'm looking for. What I'd really love to see is Google release a modern version of the Nexus 7, but we all know that won't happen.</p>
<h2 id="google-should-change-its-mind-2">Google should change its mind</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT" name="home-control-screen-saver-pixel-9-pro-fold-google-pixel-tablet.jpg.jpg" alt="Home Control screen saver on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and widgets on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I guess it's only right for me to finish this piece by pleading with Google again. I feel like it's turning into a bit of a habit, as I've pleaded and begged for Google to reverse rumored decisions, only for them to fall on deaf ears. But I digress.</p><p>The first thing that I want Google to change its mind about is exiting the tablet market. Of course, these are just rumors, and nothing has been confirmed, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-2-alleged-changes-upgrades-report">all of the signs point to</a> the Pixel Tablet being a "one-and-done" device. And frankly, that's just downright disappointing.</p><p>Even in its current state, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> is pretty great as long as you understand the limitations up front. For me, the Tablet and Charging Dock have been a staple on my desk, giving me the best smart home controller that I've ever used. No, I'm not here to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-is-just-teasing-us-now-android-15-pixel-tablet">make <em>that </em>argument again</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bdh92q9a3nU3B2szVNj7vD" name="google-pixel-tablet-review-split-screen-2.jpg" alt="Split-screen apps on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bdh92q9a3nU3B2szVNj7vD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All I'm saying is that I want to see Google stick with the tablet, at least for another iteration or two. How can a company expect sales to be great when it takes an odd approach to the release? Everything was (mostly) fine when you could only get the Pixel Tablet with the Charging Speaker Dock. But then, Google changed course and made it so you could buy the Pixel Tablet by itself. Oh, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-solo-launch-announcement">that happened</a> a year after the original release.</p><p>It also doesn't help that the Pixel Tablet uses an LCD panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and a processor that can't take full advantage of the new Gemini features that Google is so focused on. If anything, there's an opportunity to give the Pixel Tablet a "glow-up" in the same way that we saw going from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-week-with-the-google-pixel-fold">Pixel Fold</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-supposed-pixel-laptop-2">What about the supposed Pixel Laptop?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3MhCiCJ58dnreFzTdesyzP" name="google-pixel-tablet-freeform-windows.jpg" alt="Freeform windows on the Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MhCiCJ58dnreFzTdesyzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's one looming question surrounding both Chromebooks and tablets, and that's whether Google is actually planning to release a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/dropping-chromeos-for-android-on-pixel-laptop-doesnt-make-sense">laptop powered by Android</a>. I'm not smart enough to know how this would affect the market, but it would definitely come as quite a shock.</p><p>While some may believe that Google is looking to replace ChromeOS with Android, I'm of the mindset that such a move <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/dropping-chromeos-for-android-on-pixel-laptop-doesnt-make-sense">would be a bad idea</a>. There's too much money involved with Chromebooks and the education segment that I don't think Google would want to jeopardize that.</p><p>That being said, I am curious about how a potential Pixel Laptop would be presented if it actually sees a release. If I'm putting on my tinfoil hat, this could be the reason why Google is rumored to have canned future Pixel Tablets. However, I don't believe that a traditional laptop powered by Android would be logical.</p><p>Although I feel as though the initial rumors were just seeded so Google could flush out some bad apples, my brain keeps telling me that it's possible. Again, not the whole Android replacing ChromeOS, but the idea of a potential Android laptop.</p><p>I'm still not even convinced that this is a "where there's smoke, there's fire" situation. But Google is working towards <em>something</em> different, as evidenced by continued improvements being made to the native Desktop Mode, along with the surprising addition of a Linux terminal app with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-2-is-here-with-our-first-look-at-the-working-linux-terminal-app">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="are-we-in-store-for-a-major-shake-up-in-2025-2">Are we in store for a major shake up in 2025?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BdbksaFDrmnYwftw36ydhc" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-6.jpg" alt="Close up on keyboard and left ports on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BdbksaFDrmnYwftw36ydhc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, how great it would be to look into a crystal ball and see what things will look like this time next year. Actually, that would kind of suck, at least depending on how things shake out.</p><p>Besides that, I'm really not expecting many drastic or earth-shattering changes to come to either Chromebooks or Android tablets. Even if the rumors the Pixel Laptop are true, I suspect that it won't see the light of day until sometime in 2026. This gives Google plenty of time to improve Android's native Desktop Mode, and implement any other features it might want to include.</p><p>Instead, we'll probably see the same companies release incremental "upgrades" while Google continues to find new ways to entice everyone to use Gemini. We expect to see the "Quick Insert" key make its way onto more Chromebooks, making it so you don't have to manually remap a key, or try to remember the keyboard combination.</p>

<p>At the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if we started to see Google introduce a dedicated Gemini key for both Chromebooks and tablets. Many of the latest Windows laptops are equipped with a Copilot key, and I suspect Google will follow suit.</p><p>Gemini is continuing to improve, as evidenced by the swath of updates Google rolled out at the end of 2024. But if Google wants to keep up with ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, it needs more ways to get people using Gemini. The addition of a dedicated key would go a long way in trying to do just that, even if it might end up as a controversial decision.</p><p>Who knows — I've been wrong before, and I hope I'm wrong again.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-52">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>One UI 7 is bringing big changes to how you handle notifications, with the latest beta introducing the 'Filter Notifications' feature.</li><li>This feature helps you sort your notifications into two categories: important ones stay at the top, and less urgent ones are tucked below.</li><li>Filtered notifications aren’t deleted, just moved to a section called 'Other Notifications,' which you can access by tapping the 'X more notifications' bubble.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s One UI 7, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, is likely to revamp how you interact with notifications, and the latest beta shows off a new feature that lets you take charge of your alerts and cut through the chaos.</p><p>Reddit user FragmentedChicken (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-7-filter-notifications-3511176/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>) uncovered a nifty new feature called Filter Notifications in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second One UI 7 beta</a>, designed to make managing alerts way easier.</p><p>You can find this handy feature in the Settings menu under 'Notifications' and then 'Advanced settings.' It splits your notifications into two categories: important alerts go to the top, while less critical ones are tucked below. It’s a simple way to keep your priorities straight.</p><p>This feature is pretty cool because it gives you a lot of control. You can filter your notifications in three ways. "Old Notifications" hides alerts that are past their prime, usually a few days old. "Background Activities" cuts out notifications from apps running in the background, so you're not bombarded. Finally, "Minimized Notifications" keeps notifications you’ve already hidden from popping back up.</p><p>Notifications marked as 'Old,' from 'Background Activities,' or ones you’ve 'Minimized' are neatly moved to a section called 'Other Notifications.' When enabled, this section shows up as a separate tab below the main notification panel.</p><p>To be clear, filtered notifications aren’t deleted—they’re just tucked away in a small 'X more notifications' bubble at the bottom of the panel. If you want to check them out, just tap it, and they’ll pop up in one tidy list.</p><p>As shown in the screenshots below, when no filters are active, the KDE Connect notification from the background app appears front and center in the main panel. Once you turn on the 'Background Activities' filter, the KDE Connect icon moves to a 'more notifications' bubble. Tapping this bubble brings up all the filtered notifications, showing them in one place.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Smartphones</a> are everywhere, making life easier, but they also bring one major downside—the endless flood of notifications. With alerts constantly popping up from all sorts of apps, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and lose focus.</p><p>The new Filter Notifications feature tackles this problem by sorting alerts based on importance. It’s a smart way to tidy up your notifications and make everything feel more organized.</p>

<hr>
<p>It's been a few weeks since Samsung rolled out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a> for the Galaxy S24, and we're still learning about new features. The latest of which aims to provide even deeper integration between your Samsung phone, tablet, and laptop.</p><p>This upcoming feature is called "Camera Continuity" and is part of the "Continue on other devices" set of features. According to the screenshot provided by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-7-camera-continuity-3511168/">Android Authority</a>, this feature lets you "Take pictures and scan documents or handwriting on your phone or tablet, then continue working on them on another device such as a tablet or computer."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.20%;"><img id="RkoWERZ2aTzWZnMrfzsZB5" name="camera-continuity-description-one-ui-7-beta-2" alt="Camera Continuity description in One UI 7 Beta 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RkoWERZ2aTzWZnMrfzsZB5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">via Android Authority </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this seems to be yet another feature locked to Samsung's Galaxy ecosystem of devices. But the requirements to use Camera Continuity go even further. It's said to only be available when your devices are on the same Wi-Fi network, Bluetooth is turned on, and you are making use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones&ved=2ahUKEwjt37_pvcaKAxUQEVkFHSxSFusQFnoECBcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1fGe9iUCg4bRuMbaC3dbPX">Samsung phones</a>, tablets, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops&ved=2ahUKEwjk3YLwvcaKAxWIEVkFHQKTJN4QFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2ZtyQjyJS1P7ir0Bx9WtmW">laptops</a>, all of which are signed into the same Samsung account.</p><p>Oh, and on top of all of that, this feature is also expected to be limited to the Samsung Internet and Samsung Notes apps. None of this is all that surprising, given that these are the same types of requirements needed whenever using similar features on Samsung devices.</p><p>If anything, this is another "feather in the cap" for those who enjoy Samsung's ecosystem, and want to see more improvements. At first glance, Camera Continuity might seem a bit redundant, given that your images and files can already sync between devices. However, this could offer a more streamlined approach, as Samsung continues to provide the only true alternative to Apple's ecosystem and feature set.</p><p>While Samsung released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout&ved=2ahUKEwjrlrvbvcaKAxUBD1kFHRCLNNsQFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw26dVWvJjSSPut3ztmAs21z">One UI 7 Beta 2</a> just a little over a week ago, it's still only limited to the Galaxy S24 lineup. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-it-matter-that-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-didnt-get-the-one-ui-7-beta">Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6</a> have been left out of the party so far, and we aren't expecting that to change. That being said, it's probably for the best as this seems to be Samsung's most ambitious update to One UI in years, and there are plenty of bugs still left to squash.</p>

Packed with a laundry list of features, Google's AI-powered chatbot can summarize long-form textual content, generate images based on the description you provide, have conversations with you, and do a whole lot more.</p><p>That's all well and good, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gemini" target="_blank">Gemini</a> is always learning from the information that is supplied to it. To that end, it saves everything—be it textual or spoken—by default. If you find that to be detrimental to your digital privacy, you'll be glad to know that it's quite easy to remove your activity from Gemini. Read on to find out how to do it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-remove-your-activity-from-gemini-2">How to remove your activity from Gemini</h2>
<p>Gemini saves all of your activity (e.g., textual prompts, spoken commands) to your Google account. As such, you can manage and delete this information through your account's activity settings. However, do note that this is only possible if you have a personal account. On the other hand, <strong>if you use a work or school Google account with Gemini, all of your activity is always saved and can't be deleted</strong>.</p>
<p>1. Go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank"><strong>https://gemini.google.com</strong></a> to launch the Gemini web app. Now, tap the <strong>hamburger icon </strong>on the top left corner to access the <strong>slide-out menu</strong>, and then tap on the <strong>Activity</strong> option.</p><p>2. On the next page, tap the <strong>Delete</strong> button (with the <em>drop-down arrow</em>) under the <strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong> sub-section.</p><p>3. Finally, choose the time frame for which you want the activity to be deleted. You can pick from <strong>Last hour</strong>, <strong>Last day</strong>, <strong>All time</strong>, or specify a <strong>Custom range</strong>.</p><p>4. You can also remove all activity from a specific day, or even an individual activity. Simply tap the <strong>X</strong> icon corresponding to the day or the activity.</p>

<h2 id="turning-off-activity-from-being-saved-and-changing-auto-deletion-settings-2">Turning off activity from being saved and changing auto-deletion settings</h2>
<p>1. Tap the <strong>Turn off</strong> button (with the <em>drop-down arrow</em>) against the <strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong> sub-section. You'll now get <strong>two options</strong>: just turn off the activity from being saved or do so along with deleting the existing saved activity. Choose the option that you'd prefer.</p><p>2. To change the auto-deletion settings, tap the arrow against the <strong>Deleting activity older than X months</strong> option. Here, you can <em>specify the time</em> (<strong>3</strong>, <strong>18</strong>, or <strong>36 months</strong>) for which the activity is kept before being automatically deleted. Tap the <strong>Next</strong> button and follow the on-screen instructions. You can also <strong>disable auto-deletion</strong> here.</p>

<p>In an effort to better compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>, Samsung is also rumored to offer two additional ring sizes. Currently, the Galaxy Ring is only available in nine different sizes, ranging from 5 to 13. Meanwhile, sizes for the Oura Ring 4 range from 4 to 15. Recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-expansion-january-rumors">rumors</a> also suggested that Samsung wouldn't wait until the Ring 2 to start offering more sizes, with a Size 14 and 15 said to become available sometime in January.</p><p>After being released in July, Samsung's first smart ring was met with mixed reviews. Android Central's Nick Sutrich, Senior Content Producer, said in their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">review</a> that although the "Galaxy Ring looks like a fantastic first-generation effort...the health tracking features feel amateur by nearly every measure." So if this latest report comes to fruition, it seems that Samsung might have been able to right the ship.</p><p>That's not all Samsung is said to be showing off during Galaxy Unpacked, as we could get our first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-smart-glasses-unpacked-2025-glimpse-tipped">Galaxy AR Smart Glasses</a>. According to the report, these "resemble conventional eyewear with a weight of approximately 50 grams." With this, Samsung is aiming to compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Glasses</a>, which currently dominate this segment of the market.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only other details provided are that Samsung is working with both Qualcomm and Google on the development. This comes as little surprise given that the Galaxy AR Glasses are said to rely on the AI capabilities of Google Gemini.</p><p>In early December, Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR</a> with Samsung making the first headset, named Project Moohan. Samsung provided a render of its headset as part of the official Android XR introduction, but it looks more like a traditional VR headset, and is far from what we would call "conventional eyewear."</p><p>Given the increasing number of recent rumors surrounding Galaxy Unpacked, we wouldn't be surprised to see more details leaked ahead of the official announcement. But until then, this gives a bit more to be excited about, besides the unveiling of Samsung's next flagship smartphones.</p>

<ul><li>Popular phone skin-maker Dbrand has started selling skins for the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>With the provided renders, we're able to see the rear camera layout and the flat edges.</li><li>After flattening out the edges on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the Galaxy S25 Ultra finishes the job.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Galaxy Unpacked is expected to be less than a month away, meanwhile, more and more details are beginning to surface about the Galaxy S25 series. The most recent one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/skins/galaxy-s25-ultra-skins">comes from Dbrand</a>, which has opened pre-orders for those who want to slap a skin on their new phone when it arrives.</p><p>This is technically the second series of devices that Dbrand has leaked in the past month after the company announced a new case for the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/nintendo-switch-2-cases">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. However, Dbrand stopped short of showing off the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra from all angles.</p><p>Instead, you can get a general idea of what to expect when going through the Galaxy S25 Skin Customizer tool. This doesn't really reveal much more that we haven't already seen. But what it does do is provide some additional confirmation that Samsung is ditching the rounded frame for good.</p>

<p>This is a trend we've seen across many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, adopting a true rectangular design, or "slab." The writing was on the wall that this same trend would come to Samsung's "Ultra" phone after the edges of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> were flattened a bit. However, these renders show that all three Galaxy S25 will share the same flattened design.</p><p>Besides that, it seems that Samsung won't be making any other changes, at least to the camera arrays. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> and Galaxy S25 Plus will look practically identical, with a trio of vertically-oriented cameras, flanked by an LED flash. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra again features a total of five rear cameras, with the flash sandwiched between the telephoto lens and the Laser AF Sensor.</p><p>There is one notable omission here, as there's no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-to-come-on-january-22-2025-leaked-image-suggests">Galaxy S25 "Slim"</a> listed. This is the fourth S25 model rumored to launch this year, but it remains unclear whether the S25 Slim will debut at Galaxy Unpacked, or if it will arrive at a later date.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RquzHm7hsoPHEMJFTuALSJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RquzHm7hsoPHEMJFTuALSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's always possible that Dbrand is just using placeholder renders based on previous device leaks. However, we're less inclined to believe that to be the case given the variety of leaks that we've already seen.</p><p>With that being said, we also don't expect to be the last time we see or hear about the Galaxy S25 lineup. There's still plenty of time between now and Galaxy Unpacked, so if anything, we're likely to learn a lot more about Samsung's next flagship smartphones.</p>

Pick up the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, for instance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip6/buy/galaxy-z-flip6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f741uzoaxaa/"><strong>you&apos;ll be eligible to receive up to $750 off</strong></a> when you trade in an old or broken device. </p><p>Even if you can&apos;t claim the max trade-in credit, Samsung is doubling (or even tripling) its usual discounts, so it&apos;s worth checking the site to see how much you can save with your old devices. After all, that beat-up Galaxy Note 20 is probably just taking up space in a drawer somewhere, right? Why not turn it into a discount on a great new flip phone? You&apos;ll thank me later. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>RedMagic loves cramming its gaming phones with insane features, and we saw that with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic-9-pro-review">RedMagic 9 Pro</a> earlier this year. The RedMagic 9S Pro is no exception—it’s a powerhouse packed with all the muscle you need for a seriously epic gaming experience.</p><p>The 9S Pro landed only a few months after its predecessor. It might just be a name change with an "S," but it packs an overclocked chipset, a new look, and improved cooling. It’s not a massive upgrade, but that’s expected since it’s more of a mid-year refresh than a full-on new phone.</p><p>If you’re new to the RedMagic brand, the 9S Pro won’t let you down if you’re after a top-tier gaming phone. Just be prepared for some ongoing software issues that can still be a bit annoying.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-9s-pro-price-and-availability"><span>RedMagic 9S Pro: Price and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ytLbjZHVQ9qJjjqckfhkJD" name="RedMagic-9S-Pro-1" alt="Redmagic 9S Pro in white" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ytLbjZHVQ9qJjjqckfhkJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RedMagic 9S Pro comes in four versions. The base Sleet model, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, is priced at $649. The Cyclone and Snowfall models, both packing 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, go for $799. And then there's the Frost model, which has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, also priced at $649.</p><p>The RedMagic 9S Pro keeps the same pricing as the 9 Pro, with one key change: the addition of the entry-level Frost model.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fv3VzuMbuweoTBZ8y8YNJa" name="RedMagic-9S-Pro-8" alt="RedMagic 9S Pro screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fv3VzuMbuweoTBZ8y8YNJa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’m a big fan of the RedMagic 9S Pro’s boxy design that’s both eye-catching and practical, and RedMagic fully owns it with those flush rear cameras. Right out of the box, you’ll notice its hefty, solid build—this thing feels substantial. It’s visually striking, something you don’t see much in phones these days. Best of all, it avoids the over-the-top, flashy look that plagues so many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phones</a>. It’s bold, sure, but there’s a clean, industrial vibe that’s hard not to love.</p><p>I have no gripes with this design approach. If you’ve used the RedMagic 9 Pro, the 9S Pro will feel right at home. It’s still a chunky, heavy phone, but that’s the price you pay for a massive 6.8-inch display and all the guts of the ICE 13.5 cooling system.</p><p>Sure, the weight might bug some people, and those sharp edges aren’t exactly hand-friendly, but it’s a seriously good-looking phone that feels rock-solid like it could survive a drop off a cliff.</p><p>The cooling fan lights up when it’s spinning but otherwise blends right in with the vertical camera stack. As for the shoulder buttons, they’ve got their own lighting, too, doubling as status or notification indicators. You can pick from seven colors and effects like flashing, breathing, or a steady glow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="7u2kU95Ejym3mnmNJD25yb" name="RedMagic-9S-Pro-2" alt="Redmagic 9S pro screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7u2kU95Ejym3mnmNJD25yb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the coolest things here is the edge-to-edge display—no camera notch, no hole, just pure screen. The front camera is tucked under the display like RedMagic’s done before, and I love it because it lets your games take center stage. There’s a tiny bezel around the edges, with the bottom a bit thicker, but it’s so close to even you won’t really care.</p><p>The screen comes in at 1116×2480 pixels, which isn’t the highest resolution out there, but it’s spot-on for gaming. A lower resolution helps the GPU keep things running smoothly, so frame rates stay high. Plus, it’s sharp enough that even small text is easy to read.</p><p>The panel’s peak brightness of 1600 nits also isn’t the brightest out there, but it’s more than enough for comfortable outdoor use. In everyday situations, the display’s brightness held up just fine, rarely needing an extra boost.</p><p>The display has subtly rounded corners, and the edges are gently curved, making it more comfortable to hold. Plus, the pre-applied screen protector blends right in, so you don’t have to worry about putting one on yourself.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The seamless display is perfect for watching movies or TV shows and gaming.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>RedMagic has fine-tuned the 9S Pro with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Leading Version. This overclocked version of the already powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> boosts performance while keeping power usage in check. Plus, AI optimizations make the gaming experience even smoother and more responsive.</p><p>While the marketing hype around the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Leading Version sounds impressive, the real-world performance difference compared to the standard version is likely minimal. The overclocked chip does offer a slight boost, but in everyday use, you probably won’t notice much of a difference, especially with less demanding tasks. To really see what the chip can do, you’d need to put it through its paces with some heavy-duty Android games.</p><p>When you dive into games like Genshin Impact or other graphically demanding titles, the 9S Pro just powers through, thanks to the 1GHz Red Core 2 Pro gaming chip. In its highest performance mode, the 9S Pro consistently hit 60fps with zero crashes, stuttering, or loading hiccups. Animations were smooth, and every action felt instant. Even in intense gaming moments, there’s no slowdown, and the large display makes it easy to see and control everything.</p><p>The RedMagic 9S Pro shines in gaming performance, but heavy sessions, especially with high-performance modes on, can make it heat up fast. To avoid discomfort, it’s a good idea to use a case or controller. Without them, the aluminum frame can get pretty warm after a while.</p><p>Many flagship phones with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 can struggle with heat and performance dips. However, the RedMagic 9S Pro’s advanced cooling system, including the active fan, allows it to maintain peak performance for longer. This means you get a smooth, responsive gaming experience, even during the most demanding sessions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Yxvk4rSgALEEAzrthLiKQa" name="RedMagic-9S-Pro-9" alt="RedMagic 9S Pro screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yxvk4rSgALEEAzrthLiKQa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RedMagic 9S Pro’s performance isn’t just about gaming—it shines in everyday use, too. Whether you’re scrolling through apps, switching between tasks, or handling more demanding apps, it does everything smoothly and effortlessly, showing off just how capable this device really is.</p><p>The RedMagic 9S Pro’s internal fan runs surprisingly quietly, which is a big win for a high-performance gaming device. Considering how important it is for keeping temperatures in check, it’s impressive. The quiet fan makes the whole gaming experience better by cutting down on distractions and creating a more immersive environment.</p><p>The device comes loaded with a solid set of gaming features, building on what previous models already nailed. While a lot of these features will feel familiar to RedMagic fans, the brand keeps adding cool new stuff with each release. It’s definitely one of the most packed gaming toolkits on any phone.</p><p>One feature I really dig is the touch-sensitive triggers with built-in LEDs. They light up, making it way easier to find them during gameplay. And it’s not just for show—the LEDs also double as notification lights, which is a nice touch.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="iUAdZvdV5fBgggEdb3pPAF" name="RedMagic-9S-Pro-5" alt="RedMagic 9S Pro cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iUAdZvdV5fBgggEdb3pPAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rear cameras on the RedMagic 9S Pro aren’t on par with other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">Android camera phones</a>, but they do a solid job in good lighting. They’re more than enough for snapping everyday moments and social media content, covering the basic photography needs of a gaming phone.</p><p>The RedMagic 9S Pro sticks with the same camera setup as its predecessor, focusing more on gaming performance than photography. While the camera has improved over time, it still lags behind dedicated camera phones, especially in image quality and versatility. That said, given the price, the camera does a decent job for most users.</p><p>You’re getting the same 50MP Samsung GN5 sensor that’s been in the last few models. It’s a solid camera, but it's not exactly groundbreaking or new.</p><p>The primary camera takes shots with slightly muted colors, and while it handles detail well in good lighting, shadows, and darker areas can look a bit blurry. The ultrawide camera struggles in low light, with less detail in the images. RedMagic applies distortion correction, but the results can still show some unnatural artifacts.</p><p>If there’s one major downside to Nubia’s all-screen design, it’s the 9S Pro’s 16MP under-display selfie camera. The selfies are pretty awful—detail, exposure, and dynamic range are all lacking, making it worse than even some budget phones with a regular front-facing camera.</p>

<p>Another thing that’s a bit annoying is how the front camera gives hazy shots because of the screen above it. It’s decent for quick calls or streaming with friends while gaming, but if you’re into taking selfies for Instagram or want something more polished, you’ll be let down.</p><p>On the software front, RedMagic’s software used to be a bit of a mess, but the company has come a long way in the past couple of years. These days, using a RedMagic device day-to-day is glitch-free and pretty enjoyable.</p><p>The RedMagic 9S Pro runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> with RedMagic OS 9.5 on top. While the interface can be a bit quirky at times, it gives you plenty of customization options to tweak things like themes, wallpapers, and menu colors to match your style.</p><p>Nubia claims that all models get "more than two years of software support" and promises at least one major Android update per year. However, it's unclear how long this will actually last. Compared to companies like Google and Samsung, which offer up to seven years of support, this feels a bit lacking.</p><p>At the end of the day, you’ve got to make some trade-offs to keep a $649 price tag on a phone with the latest Snapdragon. But when it comes to gaming, the RedMagic 9S Pro absolutely delivers, and that’s what really matters.</p>

<p>Nubia and ASUS are usually at the top of our gaming phone rankings, so the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ROG Phone 9</a> series might catch your eye. But if you’re not looking to break the bank, the ROG Phone 8 from last year is still a beast and a way better deal.</p><p>The ASUS ROG Phone 8 might not be the newest model, but it’s still a solid pick. While it might not have the same bang-for-your-buck appeal as the RedMagic 9S Pro, its better software support, improved camera, and more comfortable design make it a great all-around gaming phone. You can also go for the beefier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8 Pro</a> if you want a little more power.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-12-review">iQOO 12</a> is a solid competitor in the budget gaming phone category, offering impressive value for its price. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset delivers performance on par with the RedMagic 9S Pro and even beats it with 120W fast charging. However, it falls short in the gaming department without features like dedicated cooling and shoulder triggers, which are a must for hardcore mobile gamers.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-9s-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>RedMagic 9S Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HkJVrqWktYESh72aAvPMXX" name="RedMagic-9S-Pro-7" alt="Redmagic 9S Pro screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HkJVrqWktYESh72aAvPMXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're after a solid value phone with great performance and an enormous battery.</li><li>You prefer a phone that stays cool even during those marathon gaming sessions.</li><li>You want a phone that lasts all day and charges up in no time.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You should not buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're after top-notch camera performance, since the RedMagic 9S Pro might not be your best bet.</li><li>You're not a fan of generic-looking interfaces.</li><li>Limited software support is a dealbreaker for you.</li></ul>
<p>The RedMagic 9S Pro is a powerhouse when it comes to gaming, with hardware that can handle even the most demanding tasks without breaking a sweat. Its advanced cooling system keeps things cool, while the overclocked chipset ensures smooth, lag-free performance in even the most intense gaming sessions. It's easily one of the most powerful smartphones out there right now. But it’s not just about gaming. The 9S Pro also delivers a solid all-around package, featuring a classic headphone jack, a stunning OLED display, and a big battery with fast charging to keep you in the game longer.</p><p>While the RedMagic 9S Pro is a beast when it comes to gaming, it doesn’t quite shine as an all-around smartphone. The lack of an IP rating and its underwhelming camera performance might be dealbreakers for those looking for a phone that excels in both gaming and everyday tasks. Sure, it offers solid value compared to premium flagships and gaming phones like the ROG Phone 9, but its durability and photography shortcomings might hold it back from claiming a top spot in the broader smartphone market.</p><p>If you're not too fussed about the camera or software quirks, and you're just after a beastly gaming phone with cool stuff like built-in cooling and air triggers, the RedMagic 9S Pro is a solid pick. It's a bit of overkill, but it’s a lot cheaper than the newer ROG phones and still delivers serious performance. If gaming is your top priority, you can’t go wrong here.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've been a VR gamer for a solid decade now and can confidently say that 2024 was VR's best year ever in some ways but the worst year in others. We got massive new releases like Batman Arkham Shadow — the first Batman Arkham game in a decade — Skydance's Behemoth, Metro Awakening, and a slew of other truly amazing games that now grace the best Meta Quest games list.</p><p>However, we also have less competition than ever, with Meta ruling the roost with 74% of the market share, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/global-xr-ar-vr-headsets-market-share-quarterly">according to Counterpoint Research</a>. The two major alternative players, Pico and Sony, saw a substantial drop in market share this year, and Apple's Vision Pro failed to make a splash because of its ridiculous price point.</p><p>Ironically enough, this was also the year that Meta announced it was opening up its OS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">becoming the Android of XR</a>, announcing that new headsets with Xbox, Asus ROG, and Lenovo branding would be coming in 2025. Essentially, that shows that the market continues to shift prominently to standalone headsets, while PC and console-attached VR headsets will almost certainly remain the minority for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h2 id="big-names-big-gains-2">Big names, big gains</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5XRHTKSC3eyssDa4etAUjf" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-hero-art2" alt="Official Batman Arkham Shadow artwork juxtaposed with a face wearing a Meta Quest 3 overtop Batman's face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5XRHTKSC3eyssDa4etAUjf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta / Camouflaj / Nicholas Sutrich)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Batman Arkham Shadow's announcement trailer debuted in May, it received plenty of harsh criticism from Arkham fans. But many people who took the time to try it were surprised by how good it was even despite not being developed by the original Arkham team.</p><p>Likewise, the reception to Metro Awakening and Skydance's Behemoth has been incredibly solid, successfully pulling a new wave of VR gamers off the couch and into the experience. Previous AAA-grade titles have failed to garner this sort of reception, and it remains to be seen whether Meta and other developers will be able to keep these gamers satisfied in 2025.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Proven VR-only development studios were carefully chosen to translate each AAA IP's unique game mechanics and atmosphere into VR and each game benefitted brilliantly from this choice.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> we know of in 2025 include the likes of Alien Rogue Incursion, the first official Alien-branded made-for-VR game, and it's entirely likely we'll continue to see more big-name titles make their way to VR platforms in 2025.</p><p>All of the big-name VR games released in 2024 have something in common, too: none of them were developed by the original developers of each respective IP. Instead, proven VR-only development studios were carefully chosen to translate each title's unique game mechanics and atmosphere into VR, and each game benefitted brilliantly from this choice.</p><p>This is hugely promising for VR gamers as it means that larger publishers and development houses will likely repeat history, especially now that we're seeing more hardware come to market from brands like Xbox and Asus ROG.</p>
<h2 id="king-meta-2">King Meta</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="srdnjh2MrjxViWjyDPn6k5" name="meta-quest-3-with-meta-logo.jpg" alt="A Meta Quest 3 headset outfitted with a BoboVR M3 Pro headstrap behind the Meta logo on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/srdnjh2MrjxViWjyDPn6k5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Meta has proven anything, it's that it'll continue to remain the king of XR going forward. Meta had the most successful pair of smart glasses in 2024, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, and the launch of the budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a> is proving to be a success if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7269726126581678081/">estimates from Black Friday weekend</a> are anything to go by.</p><p>Pico never got a good foothold in the market because of U.S. trade relations with China. It is owned by Bytedance, the controversial parent company of TikTok, which made it impossible to officially sell in the country. Pico has done OK elsewhere in the world but still represents less than 10% of headset sales in the most recent quarter per Counterpoint Research's data.</p><p>Likewise, Sony's lack of substantial support for its PlayStation VR2 headset meant that sales continued to dwindle throughout the year.

<p>Google is launching Android XR in 2025, but there's seemingly no hardware ready for the fledgling new platform. Google says this is the first Android "built for the Gemini era," complete with some impressive-looking new user interface concepts that could very well revolutionize how we interact with XR devices in the future. We'll have to wait for an actual market-ready device first, though, which may likely come from Samsung with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Project Moohan</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google and Valve could potentially disrupt the VR market in huge ways in 2025, leading to some exciting possibilities.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Valve's standalone VR headset — known currently as Valve Deckard — could disrupt the VR market in an important way, similar to how the company disrupted the portable console market with the Steam Deck two years ago.</p><p>Rumors for Deckard have been going around for what feels like years, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1864827388682543501">latest leaks and rumors</a> show that Valve is working on a new SteamOS-based product and new VR controllers. Steam is a fan-favorite content distribution network and is largely considered the most consumer-friendly digital marketplace on the planet.</p><p>With that kind of mindshare, Valve could make huge waves in the VR market if it finally debuts its long-awaited standalone hardware. Otherwise, considering the momentum Meta has built up along with its new hardware partners, it's looking like a Meta headset is still the best place to play VR in 2025.</p><p>Not only that, but Meta's lead in smart glasses and multimodal AI makes the company the most likely to continue to push the limit on what we are expecting from VR and even XR, as a whole. Google has a real chance of disrupting the market in 2025, but Meta is the most likely company to deliver on promises and expectations next year and beyond.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta needs to work on better curating the immense content it has instead of promoting Horizon Worlds so much.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Meta needs to work on better surfacing and curating the games that are available on its platform, as the indies that mostly power the platform's content tend to get buried by Meta's own Horizon Worlds Metaverse promotions. Much of the industry's success and future is riding on Meta's ability to manage the lead it currently has, but the company hasn't always shown it makes the best decisions in the interest of the developers that support it.</p><p>However, the video game market's slow decline in 2024 isn't likely to let up in 2025 unless some important economic factors change. This means that sales across the board — whether we're talking PS5 games or Meta Quest headsets — will likely be lower than in prior years.</p><p>Several developers closed their doors in 2024 because of this, and I don't necessarily think that trend will change in 2025. I don't think this will affect the number of big-name games Meta and others are sure to reveal throughout the year, but it might mean some of your favorite games could close up shop if player numbers don't improve.</p><p>It's a tough market out there, and while 2025 isn't likely to improve much, it will also help players strengthen their business models and remain resilient through difficult periods in the future. Whoever is left standing at the end of 2025 will, no doubt, take in the lion's share of the winnings going forward.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-72">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Gemini Advanced's Deep Research feature was first announced for users early this month for English language.</li><li>The feature is now being expanded to more languages and regions.</li><li>Deep Research allows users to explore complex topics and convert them to an easy-to-read report within minutes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has rolled out impressive upgrades for its Gemini, and as part of the upgrade, it also announced a new tool dubbed Deep Research for Gemini Advanced users, which is now expanding to more countries and in additional new languages.</p><p>Deep Research is a personal AI research assistant tool for Gemini AI users, and it is now available in over 45 languages and across 100 countries worldwide, the company announced for Gemini Advanced users just before the holidays. Users can try it by selecting "Gemini 1.5 Pro with Deep Research" from the Gemini Advanced drop-down menu.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/Gemini_Deep_Research_v13.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/Gemini_Deep_Research_v13.mp4"></video></div>
<p>Deep Research aims to save hours of time by "deeply analyzing relevant information from across the web," making the AI assistant even more helpful than it already is.</p><p>For instance, if you raise a question, Deep Research "creates a multi-step research plan for you to either revise or approve. Once you approve, it begins deeply analyzing relevant information from across the web on your behalf."</p><p>The new feature will try to explore complex topics and convert them to a more comprehensive and easy-to-read report, which can further be exported to your Google Docs.</p>
<p>The organized report will also include links with original sources, relevant websites, or businesses if users want to dive in further for more details. Since it’s an AI assistant, users can further ask follow-up questions or ask it to refine, and it will generate reports within minutes.</p><p>The search giant began the Deep Research rollout early this month for Gemini Advanced users on Desktop and mobile web. While the initial rollout was for English-speaking users, the latest announcement adds languages and more countries as aforementioned. The Gemini mobile app users, however, can expect the feature rollout as early as next year, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">announcement blog post</a>.</p>

You have the usual Chinese contingent of Vivo, OPPO, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Honor dominating sales, but Samsung and Google also sell most of their products in Asian markets, and Apple is slowly building momentum with the iPhone.</p><p>I used over 70 phones over the course of 2024, and while there were devices that didn't measure up to their asking price, I didn't run into any bad phones as such. The one brand that stood out the most to me is Vivo. It delivered truly incredible cameras in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a>, and it made heady gains in the mid-range with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">V30 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v40-pro-review">V40 Pro</a>, delivering much better sensors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QdMVVBmc8NXnVneLTRuqpD" name="2025 Phone Pile" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X200, Find X8, Find X8 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QdMVVBmc8NXnVneLTRuqpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Clearly, I'm not the only one who liked the brand's progress, as Vivo managed to extend its lead in both China and India considerably. Vivo is likely to continue that momentum in 2025 on the back of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>. As much as I like the X200 Pro, I'm waiting to see what the X200 Ultra brings to the table. Vivo doesn't actually need to change much with the device, but if it manages to retain the same set of cameras while making the phone available in at least select regions outside China, it will be a monumental achievement.</p><p>While the V series is stronger than ever, the upgrades with the V40 Pro pushed it closer to value flagships, and Vivo needs to focus on the Y series to maintain its mid-range presence. I'm excited to see what's in store with the V50 and V50 Pro, and whether they can deliver the same caliber of photos as the X series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JBuAZcDsumoy2qRGJxkVoD" name="2025 Phone Pile" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X200, Find X8, Find X8 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JBuAZcDsumoy2qRGJxkVoD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although OPPO lost ground in China, it solidified its position as the second-largest handset brand in India on the back of the Reno 12, K series, and A series devices. While I enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> quite a bit, I don't think OPPO has the cachet to steal market share from Apple and Samsung just yet, but its introduction in additional global markets should give OPPO a decent platform on which to build. The one issue I have with the X8 Pro is that it doesn't have the best cameras the brand makes, and that will inevitably debut on the X8 Ultra sometime in Q2 2025. Just like with Vivo, the X8 Ultra needs to launch globally to make the cameras accessible by a wider audience.</p><p>OnePlus, meanwhile, is doing all the right things. Although the manufacturer lost market share in 2024, its device portfolio is stronger than ever, and the imminent global launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> should allow the brand to take on Samsung and Google. What I like is that the R series is also sold globally, and with the OnePlus 12R still one of the best mid-rangers available today, I'm intrigued to see what the 13R can deliver. I just want to see the device continue to deliver the same value-focused ethos, and with the manufacturer confirming a class-leading 6000mAh battery, it has the potential to do incredibly well.</p>

<p>Xiaomi continues to do well thanks to its budget-focused portfolio, but that narrative has changed in recent years as it shifted to the mid-range with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus</a>. In doing so, Xiaomi is effectively ceding ground to its rivals, and that's one of the reasons why it is no longer in the top position in India. The brand needs to rethink its strategy and go back to delivering budget phones with strong value — that just hasn't been the case in the last two years. Honestly, Xiaomi needs to do an overhaul of its devices, and rethink its strategy. That's the only way it can retain its footing against its rivals, but I don't see the brand doing so in 2025. <br><br>I really like what Honor is doing these days; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> are two of my best phones of the year — with the latter being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a> around — and the brand is taking a radically different strategy to everyone else, positioning itself as a premium player to stand out. While that may not yield market share, Honor certainly takes up a lot of mind share, and with the brand regaining its foothold in India, 2025 should be a pivotal year for its global ambitions. The Magic 7 Pro is launching shortly, and I'd like to see the device delivering better cameras; while the 6 Pro was great in its own right, it didn't quite measure up to the X100 Pro, and Honor needs to be on the same level as Vivo.</p><p>I usually turn to a Pixel as my daily driver, and that hasn't changed in 2024. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> is a worthy upgrade, and while it costs more, it has meaningful changes across the board and takes brilliant photos. The only issue with the device is that the hardware isn't on par with its rivals, although that may change in 2025. Google is set to switch away from Samsung's designs and go with MediaTek, which means that the Pixel 10 should be noticeably better in this regard. The biggest thing that Google needs to change with the Pixel 10 is the internal hardware; the Tensor platform may be good in mid-rangers, but it just doesn't measure up against what Qualcomm and MediaTek are doing in the high-end category, and Google needs to do better. The latest leaks point to the brand doing just that with the Tensor G5, but I want to get my hands on the device to see how it actually holds up.</p>

<p>As for Samsung, the brand lost ground in India and other Asian markets this year, and that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">down to its own shortcomings</a>. While it built up an early lead in foldables, the lack of any meaningful innovation has allowed Chinese brands to eat into its market share, and Samsung is losing ground in the mid-range as well. What's interesting is that the brand is positioning the FE devices as its value-focused models in major regions like the U.S. instead of traditional bestsellers like the Galaxy A55, and I don't think that's the best move. While high-end devices contribute to Samsung's bottom line, it's the mid-range where the brand sees a bulk of its sales, and it needs to bring its best devices to all regions.</p><p>Like much of the last decade, value-focused phones will dominate sales in 2025, but there is a growing demand for mid-range and even high-end devices, and that's encouraging to see. With all major manufacturers introducing their products earlier than before, we don't have to wait as long to see what's in store with the best 2025 phones, and that's always a good thing.</p>

While you could pick out several other innovations made in years prior, 2024 marked an important year where phones debuted more eye-friendly displays, finally adopted years of promised software updates, got overheating under control, and moved toward more consumer-friendly practices like better repairability.</p><p>But I'm not confident that 2025 is going to be quite as good. Patent disputes between Samsung and BOE <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www-thelec-kr.translate.goog/news/articleView.html?idxno=31229&_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp">are heating up</a>, threatening to get BOE displays banned here in the States. For me, that's particularly concerning because Samsung AMOLED panels typically use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, which gives me headaches and makes it impossible to use these types of displays long-term, while BOE panels are far more eye-friendly.</p><p>We're also seeing design convergence go back to the "iPhone is best" model among OEMs, something that hasn't happened en masse in a very long time. I don't just mean the overly flat hardware design, either. Samsung's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-one-ui-7-might-take-a-big-page-out-of-apples-ios-playbook">OneUI 7 looks more iPhoney than ever</a>, and companies have been slowly introducing iPhone designs like split notification shades and the Dynamic Island to Android phones in the latest software updates.</p><p>Of course, some of these trends are positive ones, but they could largely mean that 2025's best phones end up all looking and feeling the same in North America, and that's something I'd rather avoid.</p>
<h2 id="be-together-not-the-same-2">Be together, not the same</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smartphones in North America — particularly in the U.S. — are mainly bought through someone's carrier of choice. Whether that's Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, or one of the many smaller carriers or MVNOs, carriers are often the most affordable way to get a new phone. Because of that, U.S. customers mainly buy from four brands: Apple, Samsung, Google, and Motorola.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/us-smartphone-market-share/">Counterpoint Research</a>, less than 10% of U.S. customers buy from other brands, a direct side effect of this buying model. As such, companies like Nothing, CMF, OnePlus, Nuu, Blu, and several others have a hard time making significant gains. Most China-based OEMS like vivo, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Honor aren't even officially sold in the U.S., further complicating matters, but more on that in a bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9yCUKsdmLFNTQDP3zvjnNE" name="iphone-14-pro-max-oppo-find-x8-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-nothing-phone-2a" alt="A Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, Oppo Find X8, Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, and Nothing Phone 2a next to each other with nearly identical designs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9yCUKsdmLFNTQDP3zvjnNE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Which phone is which? Good luck telling them apart from most angles. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once upon a time, Android's slogan was "Be together, not the same." It proved a point that Android phones might all look different, but they share the same core experience and apps, giving users true choice without sacrificing the apps or services they love.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>From the rumored Samsung Galaxy S25 to the recently launched Google Pixel 9 series, many phones now look just like iPhones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Looking forward to the 2025 North American smartphone market reveals less choice than ever, and even the few players in the market seem to be converging around a master hardware design language that feels uninspired and wholly utilitarian. From the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> to the recently launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>, many phones now just look like an iPhone.</p><p>Many people seem to prefer flat front glass on their phones, if for no other reason than it makes finding a tempered glass screen protector easier. Unfortunately, most Android phones in the U.S. have (or will have) ultrasonic fingerprint sensors in 2025, which are sometimes faster and more accurate — although that depends highly on the person.</p><p>The issue is that many tempered glass screen protectors render ultrasonic fingerprint sensors useless. They simply don't work at all when a protector is over top. Seems like it defeats the point, doesn't it?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XSzAZDXTpRYXADiJvSPikh" name="OnePlus-13-launch-teaser.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 launch tease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XSzAZDXTpRYXADiJvSPikh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This makes product testing more important than ever, particularly since the biggest advantage of a flat display is that it makes adding a screen protector easier. No modern Android phone does advanced facial recognition, as Google tried to push back on the Pixel 4 line, so good fingerprint sensor performance is extremely important for a good user experience.</p><p>I'm not convinced the current hardware design trajectory is entirely a good thing, but that's why we have to have alternatives. OnePlus and Motorola continue to be the biggest alternatives available to Samsung, Google, and Apple, which is a great thing, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">the big three aren't prioritizing eye health</a> the way they should.</p><p>Some new entries into the more affordable phones market in 2024 have me confident in this sector for 2025. Nuu and CMF both delivered fantastic entries under $300, bringing back the feeling that you can still buy a good phone without spending $500, $1000, or even more. My hope is that these two companies — plus a few others — continue this trajectory through 2025 and buck the trend of more expensive phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-china-quotient-2">The China quotient</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hyet8kTDnvDvroVXqHRHoQ" name="vivo-x100-ultra-26.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hyet8kTDnvDvroVXqHRHoQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The U.S. government continues to wage economic war on China, and with that, a wave of new tariffs and bans are expected to come forward in 2025. While this is appealing from a "domestic" standpoint, the problem is that nearly all the real competition for Google, Samsung, and Apple is from China. Lenovo, a China-based company, owns Motorola. BBK, a China-based group, owns OnePlus.</p><p>From my perspective, the two best hopes here are Nothing — as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">Nothing's sub-brand CMF</a> — and Nuu. Nothing is based in London, and Nuu is based in Hong Kong. There are other brands that could deliver good alternatives in the wake of a full China product ban, but these two are the shining gems, in my estimation.</p><p>From what I can tell at the moment, a "full ban" won't happen, but I fully expect price increases on phones from Chinese brands, particularly in the U.S.</p><p>Given that these companies are among the few keeping prices low, I would hope that lawmakers take a moment to think of other economic repercussions before making sweeping legislation.</p>
<h2 id="better-performance-than-ever-2">Better performance than ever</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a long, long time, Android has been a sort of "second-class citizen" when it comes to performance versus Apple silicon. Last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 was the closest we've ever been to Apple-like performance on Android phones, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite in upcoming 2025 phones is the first time <em>ever</em> that we've seen Snapdragon chips eclipse Apple's latest in most metrics.</p><p>That's beyond exciting, to say the least, and it was achieved by Qualcomm unifying its chipsets across mobile and laptops. In other words, we're getting laptop-grade performance out of our 2025 flagship phones. Now that's a massive upgrade!</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Tensor G5 could finally bring Pixels the performance boost they've needed in 2025.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Not only that, but it's said that Qualcomm has done a better job of keeping thermals in check all while delivering better performance. The last two times we saw a big shift in the naming convention and processor design — that's the Snapdragon 810 and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 — things didn't go so well and chips regularly overheated. Based on what we know, the third time seems to be the charm for Qualcomm.</p><p>Google Pixel phones are finally in for a big performance upgrade in 2025, too, if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-made-by-tsmc-in-the-works">Tensor G5</a> leaks are anything to go by. It's been said for years that Google till be moving to TSMC for Tensor G5 instead of using Samsung cores, and that G5 is the first "fully custom" Tensor chip.</p><p>Previous generations were built on Exynos technology and it regularly felt like it. Tensor G4 performance in the Pixel 9 series is akin to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 which, as you can guess, is now 3 full generations behind what Qualcomm just released.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-folding-phones-2">The future of folding phones</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SKUr5PNUfgSteGYfKDjmX6" name="2024-phone-pile-14.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SKUr5PNUfgSteGYfKDjmX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, I wanted to cover the state of folding phones and what 2025 holds for them. We've already seen rumors that one major player <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-and-oneplus-are-crucial-to-foldable-market">is pulling out of the folding phone category</a>. Fewer players are always worse for competition, but folding phones remain a relatively small portion of even the biggest phone manufacturers' earnings statements, so it's not much of a surprise to see one company potentially pulling out.</p><p>From my point of view, folding phones are already excellent, and 2024 proved to be the best year yet for the segment. While we didn't get a follow-up to the OnePlus Open, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> both surprised me in the best ways.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>2024 was a great year for folding phones, but with one player rumored to leave the space, 2025 is feeling a little uncertain.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>On the Flip-side, Motorola continues to impress with its Razr reboot.  Motorola has consistently delivered excellent hardware design, superb battery life, surprisingly good cameras, and the very best flip phone software on the market, plus a new commitment to providing long-term updates.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, though, I'm not feeling the best about 2025, even if there are still some bright spots here in the U.S. market. Carriers continue to have a stranglehold on the country's phone distribution systems, and smaller players have a hard time getting a foot in the door because of it. If there's any kind of change needed here, it's to help move people away from carrier dependence so we can have better choices for mobile devices.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 is already available in China, and it's just weeks away from a global launch. Naturally, that means it's just about time for current OnePlus phone owners to think about whether the upgrade is worth it.</p><p>If you happen to own a OnePlus 11 device, that's a complicated decision. With a better display, processor, and camera system, the OnePlus 13 certainly has the edge over the OnePlus 11. However, considering the latter already has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and will get two more Android OS upgrades, upgrading from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a> isn't absolutely necessary.</p><p>Are you curious how the two phones will compare when the OnePlus 13 debuts globally in January? We're about to break down how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and the OnePlus 11 stack up against one another and hopefully help you decide whether it's time to upgrade.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LK6ZtRVbAb4To3UytPsuiY" name="oneplus-13-official-01" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LK6ZtRVbAb4To3UytPsuiY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Believe it or not, OnePlus phones have come a long way in two short years. The OnePlus 11 and OnePlus 13 might loosely resemble each other from afar, but the differences are evident up close. Some might be hard to see, too — the OnePlus 13's IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 durability</a> ratings crush the IP64 certification of the OnePlus 11, for example.</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus 13 is bigger than the OnePlus 11. It sports a 6.82-inch AMOLED display, whereas the OnePlus 11 features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display. They'll look similar on the spec sheet — both phones have LTPO AMOLED panes supporting 120Hz refresh rates — but they're very different. Notably, the OnePlus 13 has a 4,500-nit peak brightness rating, and the OnePlus 11 can only hit 1,300 nits. The OnePlus 11 has a slightly curved display, while the OnePlus 13 has a completely flat panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aUSAEc3pF6Up5neE4fSKuK" name="oneplus-11-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus 11 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aUSAEc3pF6Up5neE4fSKuK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of dimensions, the OnePlus 13 measures 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5-8.9 mm and the OnePlus 11 measures 163.1 x 74.1 x 8.53 mm. That means the OnePlus 11 will be both thinner and lighter than some variants of the OnePlus 13. The former weighs 205 grams, and the latter weighs between 210 and 213 grams.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.72%;"><img id="kXpp9EmL82wDhEaQqiutEo" name="op-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kXpp9EmL82wDhEaQqiutEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1780" height="885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design of the OnePlus 13 may be more visually appealing to some, with a circular camera bump that doesn't flow into the side rails of the chassis like the OnePlus 11. The OnePlus 13 comes in Black Eclipse, Midnight Ocean, and Arctic Dawn colorways, and the OnePlus 11 is available in Titan Black and Eternal Green. You can read more about the OnePlus 13 design in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/exclusive-onepluss-head-of-industrial-design-on-delivering-the-best-in-hand-feel-with-the-oneplus-13">exclusive interview with OnePlus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-11-hardware-and-specs-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 11: Hardware and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pwJEYxh2Hae8tqeuD44MB5" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pwJEYxh2Hae8tqeuD44MB5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The bigger differences may come from what's on the inside. In some ways, the OnePlus 11 holds its own entering 2025. It has 5G, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, and NFC for connectivity — enough to hang with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android flagships</a> of 2024. It'll fall short in other key areas, like the UFS 3.1 storage for the base model. Most importantly, the OnePlus 11 lacks wireless charging. It was a glaring omission when the phone launched, and that missing feature has only made the device less appealing as it ages.</p><p>It doesn't exactly get better when the two devices' processors are compared. The OnePlus 13 is powered by Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, which uses the company's custom Oryon cores for superb performance. It'll crush its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, and even more so, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> that powers the OnePlus 11. The upgraded configuration of the OnePlus 11 with 16GB RAM better competes with the OnePlus 13, which comes with up to 24GB RAM. However, the newer model is better in every way when performance is considered.</p>

<p>Aside from the lack of wireless charging, the OnePlus 13 also beats the OnePlus 11 in terms of battery capacity and charging speeds. The OnePlus 13 can do 100W wired fast charging while refilling its 6,000mAh-capacity battery. Meanwhile, the 5,000mAh battery in the OnePlus 11 can only be charged at 80W speeds in North America. The OnePlus 13 is more versatile, with 50W wireless charging, 10W reverse wireless charging, and 5W reverse wired charging.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-11-software-and-cameras-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 11: Software and cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oSqYGyywSpnBh2ZFaUQtzK" name="oneplus-11-19.jpg" alt="OnePlus 11 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oSqYGyywSpnBh2ZFaUQtzK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One area where the OnePlus 11 has fared quite nicely is in software. Today, the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-12-is-now-getting-the-stable-android-15-update" target="_blank">OxygenOS 15</a>, based on Android 15. It started with Android 13 and was guaranteed four years of OS upgrades, so it should at least get two more Android OS versions. That means it's definitely not time to toss the OnePlus 11 aside — it'll last at least two more years.</p><p>An area that the OnePlus 11 hasn't fared so great is its camera hardware. On paper, the main 50MP doesn't look so bad. However, the OnePlus 13's camera system — with a 50MP, f/1.6 main sensor, a  50MP, f/2.2 ultrawide lens, and a 50 MP, f/2.6 periscope telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom — will blow it out of the water. Additionally, the OnePlus 11's front-facing camera is in the left corner of the display, which is a dated characteristic heading into 2025.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-11-should-you-upgrade-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 11: Should you upgrade?</h2>

<p>Right now, it doesn't make much sense to buy the OnePlus 11. It's available for the same price as (or more than, in some cases) the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, which is a newer and better phone overall. But if you have the OnePlus 11, you're probably wondering whether now is a good time to upgrade.</p><p>In this case, two things are true. You can absolutely squeeze a few more years out of the OnePlus 11 if you need to — it's running the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a>, will get full OS upgrades for the next two years, and has decent performance entering 2025. At the same time, the OnePlus 13 is a massive upgrade thanks to its wireless charging tech, Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and overall improved hardware.</p>

<p>Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra is likely right around the corner, and it'll face tough competition from the jump. On the Android side of things, the OnePlus 13 is launching in early January, ahead of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Meanwhile, on the other side of the walled garden, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is already out and used by many people now.</p><p>So, how will one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones </a>compare to the best iPhone? That remains to be seen, but both devices have a lot going for them. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max by the Apple A18 Pro — the two best chipsets in the world. Plus, the phones will have industry-leading cameras and displays.</p><p>While the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hasn't been officially announced yet, we're here to give you an early look at how it compares to the iPhone 16 Pro Max based on the latest rumors and leaks.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-max-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="98HWPjmm9qdD2aBRcKnpVJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/98HWPjmm9qdD2aBRcKnpVJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smartphones keep getting bigger, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> continued that trend. At 163 x 77.6 x 8.3 mm, it's similar in size to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> but sports a bigger 6.9-inch OLED display. By comparison, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to keep the same 6.8-inch OLED display as its predecessor. The device will measure 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm, according to the latest rumors, making it slightly smaller than the iPhone 16 Pro Max for the first time in a while.</p><p>In terms of materials, the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra should be very similar. Both devices will use a combination of glass and titanium to form a protective chassis certified for IP68 dust and water resistance. Although we're starting to see our first IP69 phones debut, neither Apple nor Samsung's flagships will match that spec.</p><p>Samsung will be slightly changing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>'s design to make it easier to hold. The strong and boxy rectangular design will be changed to feature slight curves at the corners — that means no more indents in the palm of your hand. It'll still have a flat display, and Samsung appears to have an edge with its Gorilla Armor anti-glare covering. Meanwhile, Apple has Ceramic Shield glass, but it doesn't have anti-reflective properties.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RquzHm7hsoPHEMJFTuALSJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RquzHm7hsoPHEMJFTuALSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The two phones have similar displays, as both are LTPO OLED panels supporting variable refresh rates up to 120Hz. Samsung's panel is expected to have a 1440 x 3120  resolution, while Apple's display has a 2868 x 1320 resolution. If the Galaxy S25 Ultra's predecessor is any indication, its screen should have a higher peak brightness than the 2,000 nits offered by the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Of course, we can't forget about the S Pen, which the Galaxy S25 Ultra will offer for built-in stylus usage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MTczvNh8hiCrjYLyN3PoaC" name="iphone-16-pro-max-28.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max tinted icons on the home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MTczvNh8hiCrjYLyN3PoaC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the back, the Galaxy S25 Ultra might appear thinner due to its smaller camera housing. The iPhone 16 Pro Max's triple-camera bump is thick and protrudes significantly from the glass back. The iPhone has more hardware customization buttons, with an Action button <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">and a new Camera Control button</a>.</p><p>Overall, the two devices are slab-style smartphones, and there's not a ton separating the two. Colors may be another tick in favor of the Galaxy, as the latest leaks suggest we could be getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-all-seven-colorways-tipped">seven colorways for the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>: Titanium Black, Titanium SilverBlue, Titanium Gray, Titanium WhiteSilver, Titanium JetBlack, Titanium JadeGreen, and Titanium PinkGold.</p>

<p>This year, it's all about what's on the inside. Both the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max will have best-in-class processors. Though there was originally debate about whether the Galaxy S25 Ultra would have a Samsung Exynos or Qualcomm Snapdragon chip inside, the rumors have settled on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">entire Galaxy S25 series going Snapdragon-only</a>. That means it'll be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite platform</a>, which brings massive performance improvements over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 from last year.</p><p>Early benchmarks for the Snapdragon 8 Elite and the Apple A18 Pro show that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is still about 10% faster in Geekbench 6. However, we don't know how Samsung might optimize or tune the chip for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Either way, both will be heavily capable for years to come.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and Apple Intelligence software suites are sure to go head-to-head. Samsung has a clear advantage with the Galaxy S25 Ultra since it has been developing AI features for much longer. Plus, certain features — like Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a> — benefit from the S Pen. However, some people will prefer the ChatGPT integration on the iPhone to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> integration on the Galaxy.</p><p>In terms of software support, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to receive seven years of full OS upgrades. While Apple devices are known for great software support, the same promise isn't made for the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Samsung phone might end up lasting longer than the iPhone when all is said and done.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-max-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7PfgBQF7krCYxZqAhyfug5" name="iphone-16-pro-max-4.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max back view showcasing cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PfgBQF7krCYxZqAhyfug5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max figure to be some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/replacing-my-dslr-with-vivo-x100-pro">best camera phones on the market</a>, so how do they compare? Based on the latest rumors, the Galaxy S25 Ultra should have a 200MP, f/1.7 main camera. It'll be paired with a 50MP 5x telephoto lens, a 10MP 3x telephoto camera, and a 50MP ultrawide sensor. Aside from minor sensor upgrades, these figures are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra" target="_blank">similar to those of </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra">the Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>To Apple's credit, the iPhone 16 Pro Max does include hardware upgrades this year. You get a 48MP, f/1.8 main camera, a 48MP, f/2.2 ultrawide camera, and a 12MP, f/2.8 telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. It'll come with 4K 120FPS video recording, whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra should feature 8K video recording. However, the iPhone will have the edge in ProRes, Dolby Vision, and Spatial Video formats.</p><p>Of course, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will likely have an extra telephoto camera that'll help with taking photos at different distances. It also has a higher megapixel count for the main camera, though that probably won't matter much in daily use.</p>

<p>While we'll have to wait for the Galaxy S25 Ultra to launch before we say whether it's better or worse than the iPhone 16 Pro Max, an early picture is clear. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> and a blazing-fast Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be as competitive with the latest iPhone as it has ever been. At the same time, iOS 18 and new hardware changes have actually made the iPhone 16 Pro Max the most approachable to Android users as it has ever been.</p><p>Longtime Android fans probably won't be enticed to switch to the iPhone, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will likely be the best option for them. However, both of these devices figure to be competitive enough to warrant a look by anyone wanting a top-tier smartphone.</p>

Identity Check is a new beta feature that forces you to perform a biometric authentication whenever you make any sensitive action on a Pixel phone away from your home or workplace.</p><p>This can include actions like accessing saved passkeys or app passwords, changing the PIN, and so on. It's a super-handy feature to have when traveling as it prevents unwanted people from compromising the security of your Pixel device, making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> even better.</p><p>Identity Check is still in beta, but Pixel phones with stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and the QPR1 update or later should have access to the feature as long as they meet the right security requirements.</p>

<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Google</strong> and then the <strong>All Services</strong> button below your email ID.</p><p>3. Scroll a bit till you see <strong>Theft protection</strong> under the <strong>Personal & device safety</strong> sub-menu. (Alternatively, you can navigate to <strong>Security & privacy > Device unlock</strong> to access Theft protection.)</p><p>4. Just below the animated image, you should see <strong>Identity Check</strong>.</p>

<p>5. The setup screen gives you some basic information about how it works and even how you can disable it if you choose to later. Tap <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p>6. You'll see a checklist of some of the prerequisites that are needed in order to enable Identity Check. If you've not done some, like set a screen lock or biometrics, you'll be prompted to complete those steps.</p><p>7. You'll also need to <strong>add a few trusted places</strong> that you frequent. Identity Check should not kick in if you try to change a password in one of the trusted places.</p><p>8. Once you see check marks for all the requirements, tap <strong>Done</strong>.</p><p>9. On the final Identity Check screen, enable the <strong>Use Identity check</strong> toggle.</p>

<h2 id="pixels-now-have-added-security-for-your-sensitive-information-when-you-travel-2">Pixels now have added security for your sensitive information when you travel</h2>
<p>With features like Identity Check, Google is really doubling down on privacy and security for its Pixel devices. You can add any number of trusted places that you frequent to avoid unnecessary authentication steps before you can perform any sensitive actions. Google specifies that Identity Check will only work on devices that support Class 3 biometrics. If you don't see that option under Theft Protection, then your device doesn't support it.</p><p>Google has specified all the sensitive actions that would trigger Identity Check and require additional biometric authentication. They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Access saved passwords and passkeys using Google Password Manager.</li><li>Autofill passwords in apps from Google Password Manager (except Chrome).</li><li>Change screen lock, PIN, pattern, and password.</li><li>Change Fingerprint or Face Unlock.</li><li>If you do a Factory reset.</li><li>Turn off Find My Device.</li><li>Turn off any theft protection features.</li><li>View trusted places.</li><li>Set up a new device with your current device.</li><li>Add or remove a Google Account.</li><li>Access Developer options.</li></ul>
<p>This added layer of protection should give you peace of mind if someone tries to access some of your phone's security settings when you're traveling. It's not just new features that are being added with Google's update, though. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-december-2024-security-pixel-update">December security patch for Pixels</a> included several fixes for audio stability and performance in some situations for Pixel 6 to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series devices. Other display and camera issues were also addressed with this update.</p>

This also requires you to sign in to Google Messages with your Gmail acccount, which means some of your personal information is visible to whoever you text. If you want to limit who can see this information, here's a quick and easy way to manage your profile in Google Messages.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-manage-your-profile-in-google-messages-2">How to manage your profile in Google Messages</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Messages</strong> app.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong> in the upper, right-hand corner.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Your profile</strong> option.</p><p>4. You'll now be on the <strong>Customize how you are seen</strong> page.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.08%;"><img id="y9xujCAAfLR5w9RwTktetg" name="change-profile-google-messages-1" alt="Google Messages profile sharing options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y9xujCAAfLR5w9RwTktetg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1200" height="889" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. If you wish to restrict who can see your profile photo, tap the <strong>camera symbol</strong> beside your photo. You can choose between <strong>Anyone </strong>or <strong>People that you interact with</strong>. The latter option includes interacting with others through other Google apps, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>.</p><p>6. Tap <strong>Save</strong> when you're done.</p><p>7. Go back to the main customization page.</p><p>8. Below your photo, you have the option to edit your name if you tap the <strong>Pencil symbol</strong>. Note that this will change your name across other Google services.</p><p>9. The last option, <strong>Show name and picture to, </strong>let's you control who can view your info. You can choose from <strong>People you message</strong>, <strong>Only your contacts</strong>, or <strong>No one</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>The first option in Step 9 will let anyone view your info after you message them, even if they haven't saved your number. The second option will let others see your info only if they've saved your number. The last one will hide your profile info from anyone you message, irrespective of whether they have saved your number or not.</p>

<p>Android users finally get their own version of iMessage thanks to RCS messaging in Google Messages. Think of it as an equivalent to WhatsApp, Telegram, or any other rich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a> that you may use. This allows you to easily share media files like videos and photos, react to messages with emojis, see when the other person is typing or when your message has been read, and so on.</p><p>On supported smartphone devices, you even get GenAI models running on-device in the Messages app. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages" target="_blank">Magic Compose,</a> for instance, is a feature using the Gemini Nano AI model that can automatically generate a set of responses based on the context of the chat.</p><p>All RCS chats between two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are end-to-end encrypted, which means all your data stays private. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">iPhone users finally got RCS</a> support with iOS 18, which allows for a similar texting experience between Android and iPhones. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that Android-iPhone RCS chats do not have end-to-end encryption yet, which is a bit of a security concern.</p>

It's a new mode available as part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> following the December Pixel Feature drop. In essence, the option will change multiple accessibility settings at once to make your smartphone easier to use.</p><p>Simple View is a new feature, so you might be unsure what exactly it does. Luckily, we've put together this guide with everything you need to know about Simple View, including how to enable and use it.</p>
<h2 id="how-simple-view-works-on-pixel-phones-2">How Simple View works on Pixel phones</h2>
<p>Google added Simple View to Pixels with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-december-2024-feature-drop-announced">December Feature Drop</a>, and it's available as an accessibility option. The setting is a quick way to change many of your Android phone's accessibility features at the same time. Here's the full list of what Simple View changes on the Pixel Launcher:</p>
<ul><li>Larger text and icon sizes</li><li>Simplified Home screen layout</li><li>Simplified 3-button navigation buttons</li><li>Higher touch sensitivity</li><li>Contact, Clock, and Weather app shortcuts*</li><li>High-contrast wallpaper*</li><li>Increased App Grid to 4x4 display*</li><li>Suggested apps locked*</li></ul>
<p>*Only available when turning on Simple View from Pixel device setup.</p><p>Although Simple View changes many settings at once, it does not prevent you from changing them afterward. You can still make changes to your Pixel's display, layout, navigation, and font settings. Additionally, if you turn off Simple View, your phone's preferences will be reverted to their original ones.</p><p>Notably, the option isn't currently available for the Pixel Fold, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or Pixel Tablet.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-on-simple-view-during-pixel-device-setup-2">How to turn on Simple View during Pixel device setup</h2>
<p>To get the full Simple View experience, you'll need to start from scratch by factory resetting your Pixel. The only way to get features like app shortcuts, a 4x4 app grid, a high-contrast wallpaper, and suggested apps locked is to enable Simple View during Pixel device setup. Note that factory resetting to turn on Simple View will erase all of your phone's data.</p><p>Once you've landed at the start of Pixel device setup, here's how to enable Simple View:</p><p>1. Turn on your Pixel phone. You should see the <strong>Welcome to your Pixel</strong> screen.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</p><p>3. Press <strong>Set up with Simple View</strong>.</p><p>4. Flip the toggle beside <strong>Use Simple View</strong>.</p>

<p>You can also enable Simple View after setting up your device using the Settings app. However, not all Simple View changes will take effect. Here's how to do it:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</p><p>3. Find the <strong>Quick Access</strong> section, then tap <strong>Simple View</strong>.</p><p>4. Flip the toggle next to <strong>Use Simple View</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>

It represents Google's return to the mixed-reality space after consigning Google Glass to enterprise and discontinuing Google Cardboard and Daydream. Sameer Samat, president of the Google ecosystem, assured us that they "never stopped working on" XR despite these public failures and that the "Gemini era" means "the time is right for XR."</p><p>While Google <em>may</em> make Android XR hardware in the future, demos like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra's multimodal AI</a> may remain internal prototypes to focus on Android XR <em>software</em> for other brands — primarily Samsung — making XR devices.</p><p>Android XR may be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">most exciting version of Android in years</a>, but anyone unfamiliar with VR headsets or smart glasses may be confused about what Android XR <em>is</em> and what it's built to do. This guide will run through the basics of what to expect, from Samsung's Project Moohan to Google's XR plans for Gemini.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-android-xr"><span>What is Android XR?</span></h2>
<p>"Android eXtended Reality" is an Android spinoff platform that's designed for wearable devices, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a> in that it's (A) co-designed with Samsung and (B) has to deliver efficient processing in a smaller form factor like glasses.</p><p>XR is a common industry term encompassing virtual, augmented, and mixed-reality devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">Smart glasses</a> don't typically fall under this umbrella since they have no reality-changing display, only audio; Google has included it, however, because it'll use the same baseline Gemini assistant as AR glasses.</p><p>Android XR software will underpin the XR headsets and glasses hardware, giving them access to Play Store apps that you won't get on other platforms — mainly Meta's Horizon OS on Quest.</p><p>The platform itself supports certain universal features like hand/controller tracking with external cameras or eye tracking with inward cameras — both enabling the kind of controls you see on the Apple Vision Pro. However, hardware developers will need to make devices that can take advantage of these tools.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> is "at the core" of Android XR, the company says. Whether it's a headset or glasses, it'll use sensors and cameras so that Gemini can "see what you see, whether it's digital or real content, hear what you hear, and react to your gestures alongside your voice."</p><p>With the conversationality of Gemini Live, paired with multimodal AI insights, Android XR will let you use natural voice commands to control the UI or ask contextual questions about what you're seeing, either in real life or in XR apps.</p><p>Outside of Gemini, Google has promised 360º videos on YouTube or Google TV, 3D Google Photos, Google Maps Immersive View, Google Meet, and Chrome with common AI tricks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond Google apps, Android XR is compatible with both WebXR and OpenXR, the most common standards for web-based and native XR apps across the industry. That should mean many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a> should port over to compatible Android XR headsets.</p><p>The Android XR SDK also supports Android Studio, ARCore, Jetpack Compose, and Unity. Any current Android apps will "just work" on Android XR (according to Google) as long as the developer opts in, though this will probably be a floating window in the "infinite desktop" virtual space; developers will want to optimize the app to the OS for any 3D visual effects. A few devs have already developed apps for Android XR with early access, including MLB, Calm, and Adobe.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/unlock-the-infinite-possibilities-of-xr-with-galaxy-ai">revealed</a> its XR headset, Project Moohan, at the same time as Google's Android XR; Moohan means "Infinity" in Korean, matching the theme. Samsung promises "state-of-the-art displays, Passthrough capabilities, and natural multi-modal input" but hasn't specified what specs it'll have when it launches to consumers in 2025.</p><p>We do know it'll use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</a>, the chipset announced in January 2024 that supports up to 4.3K per eye, plus a 20% CPU boost and 15% GPU boost over the XR2 Gen 2 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. However, it's not guaranteed that Moohan will hit that resolution.</p><p>Based on the render above — plus private demos given to a few outlets — we know Samsung's XR headset will have a comfortable Elite-style strap, as well as a removable light shield for better immersion during VR experiences but less isolation during mixed-reality apps. It'll have outer IR cameras for tracking hands or controllers, plus inward cameras for eye tracking.</p><p>While Samsung has its own apps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> built off of Gemini, we believe Android XR (and Moohan) will default to Google apps and multimodal Gemini AI for commands and navigation, based on what we heard from Samsung.</p>

<p>Other Android XR hardware developers will likely choose the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 as well, given that Google partnered with Qualcomm and optimized the platform for its silicon. Google has confirmed that Xreal, Sony, and Lynx will develop Android XR devices.</p><p>At CES 2024, Sony <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-announces-high-end-xr-headset-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro">announced an XR headset</a> with the XR2+ Gen 2, 4K OLED micro-displays with pancake lenses that you can flip up like a visor, and 3D productivity software. It's the most likely candidate for Sony's Android XR device.</p><p>Xreal recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-spatial-ar-glasses-announced">spatial AR glasses</a> with up to 57-degree FoV and an add-on Xreal Eye Camera for capturing 1080p video and sending data to your phone for "multimodal AI." We don't think these glasses will support Android XR, but that camera sounds like the precursor to a newer version with Google software and Gemini built-in, with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> powering things.</p><p>Lynx, whose current XR headset has dealt with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/lynx-r1-production-an-absolute-mess/">delays and controversy</a>, will develop a new Android XR headset rather than update the R1, based on a statement made to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/sony-lynx-xreal-android-xr-devices/">UploadVR</a>.</p>

<p>Google is taking a backseat to Samsung in terms of releasing an actual Android XR device, focusing on software. At least for now!</p><p>In 2023, The Information reported on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">Google's XR prototypes</a>, including Project Moohan, a monocular Google Glass-lookalike codenamed "Betty," a two-display spin-off called "Barry," and an unnamed pair of smart glasses from former Magic Leap CTO Paul Greco and his team.</p><p>It's very possible that these devices are nothing more than prototypes developed to test Android XR, rather than anything planned for wide release. But Google did show off its own Android XR smart glasses demo to sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319528/google-android-xr-samsung-project-moohan-smart-glasses">The Verge</a> with multimodal AI capabilities, and it also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">showed a glimpse of these glasses at I/O 2024</a> (see the screenshot above).</p><p>It's <em>possible</em> that Google could join in on the Android XR fun, but it evidently wants to try and let its partners establish themselves first before cutting in on the action. It's similar to how Google co-developed the new version of Wear OS with Samsung in 2021 but didn't release its first Pixel Watch until late 2022.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os"><span>Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="u28GKqQBsoUfoH8M4RUFfK" name="meta-horizon-os-official-concept-work.jpg" alt="An official concept image of a potential Meta Horizon OS VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u28GKqQBsoUfoH8M4RUFfK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="780" height="439" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Meta Horizon OS concept work </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest rival to Android XR will be Meta Horizon OS, the system behind Quest headsets. Meta is the most established brand in the XR space, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-play-store-not-on-meta-quest-headsets">tried to get Google to give Quest headsets Play Store access</a>, only for Google to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">insist that Meta use Android XR</a>, which Meta rebuffed.</p><p>Meta itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">made Meta Horizon OS open to partners</a> in 2024, announcing that Lenovo and ASUS ROG would make XR headsets with Meta software and apps. Meta and Xbox also plan to coordinate on a limited-edition headset.</p><p>Meta has a full library of games it can share with partners, as well as Meta AI. What it doesn't have is access to a Play Store full of apps and a development pipeline designed to convert phone apps into Android XR apps, like Google has; it has to use progressive web apps, and it's had very few productivity partners thus far.</p><p>Both platforms use Snapdragon chipsets, hand tracking, and UIs that float windows in virtual or mixed-reality space. Meta has its own popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>, and the promise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> in 2027, and they both use a similar interface to the Quest.</p><p>All of this is to say, Meta Horizon and Android XR have similar goals, methods, and devices. It's far too soon to say if Android XR will be better, worse, or a clone of Meta Horizon. What matters most is that Meta and Google will challenge one another, which ideally will lead to greater innovation in the XR space.</p>

Head to Walmart now and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Tune-Beam-Headphones-in-Ear-Earbuds/1597454551"><strong>you can score a whopping $60.95 off the JBL Tune Beam</strong></a>, knocking the price of the already-affordable earbuds down to a mere $39. </p>

<p>Currently just shy of $40 during Walmart's Christmas sale, the Tune Beam earbuds from JBL give you some decent noise cancellation, a well-rounded sound profile with 6mm drivers and plenty of bass (customizable in the companion app), and a shockingly good 48 hours of max battery life. I'm also a fan of those little battery alert lights built into the charging case. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Tune-Beam-Headphones-in-Ear-Earbuds/1597454551" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1f0ee58a-9e21-4a96-a569-0815f53fb1f2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="JBL Tune Beam earbuds: $99.95" data-dimension48="JBL Tune Beam earbuds: $99.95">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a cheap pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> that won&apos;t skimp on premium features like active noise cancellation (ANC); battery life is important to you. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need the best sound quality and can afford to spend a little more (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C345M3T7"><strong>might I suggest the Sony WF-1000XM5, if so?</strong></a>); you need features like spatial audio support and adaptive ANC. </p><p>The JBL Tune Beam won&apos;t win any awards for innovation, but you&apos;re still getting iconic JBL sound with noise cancellation, up to 48 hours of battery life, and IP54 water/dust resistance straight out of the box. All of this for 40 bucks? Yeah, it&apos;s that good. The box even comes with some replacement bud covers so you can find the size that works best for you. </p><p>Sure, you&apos;ll be missing out on some fancy features like spatial audio support and hands-free calling, but again, they&apos;re 40 bucks. Audiophiles should probably look elsewhere, but if you need a pair of simple, sturdy earbuds to take on your morning jogs, then this deal is unmissable.</p>

Yes, 2024 was fun for those of us journalists covering consumer audio technology, and I hope that the work we’ve done has helped you have just as much fun — whether you’ve purchased any audio gear in 2024 based on something you’ve read here, or you’re just an enthusiast who enjoys reading about it.</p><p>In case you didn’t buy anything in 2024 and are looking to 2025 to be the year that you up your audio game, I’m going to explore where we’ve been in 2024 and how that has shaped what I want to see and, hopefully, what you’ll be able to buy in 2025. Let’s get into it!</p>

<h2 id="manufacturers-do-this-in-2025-2">Manufacturers! Do this in 2025…</h2>
<p>I’m a simple man. I can be easily entertained, so maybe this seems like it isn’t the grand, showy feature you were expecting but my favorite feature in 2024 that should be in every pair of earbuds in 2025 and beyond is offline voice control.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have the ability to control some basic but frequently used features of the earbuds with your voice <em>without having to use a wake word.</em> It’s just very natural and worked flawlessly for me when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review" target="_blank">I reviewed the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.</a> It’s basic, but for those of us out on a hike, working out in the gym, or cooking, this feature is priceless.</p>

<p>As a Star Trek nerd, the next feature I want to see in every premium pair of earbuds in 2025 comes from Samsung again, and that’s the Galaxy AI-driven live translation through the earbuds during phone calls. This feature allows you to speak to someone in English, for example, Galaxy AI will process that in the cloud, and then an AI voice will speak your words to them in their native language. This works bi-directionally.</p><p>There are purpose-built earbuds already on the market that specifically do live translations, similar to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and of course, you can already use Google Translate through other earbuds, including the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which isn't as seamless an experience. Still, the technology is there for Samsung's version of live translation of phone calls to be ubiquitous across pairs of major manufacturer buds at a certain price point.</p><p>Engage!</p>

<p>With those two very practical favorites of mine out of the way, let’s talk open skies, big ideas, and technology that could make things better for those who need assistive technology.</p><p>Different manufacturers have their own flavor of audio sharing, and none of them work cross-platform. If you’re an Apple fan and want to watch a movie with a friend on a train, for example, you’ll need Apple or Beats earbuds, and they both need to support the <em>Share Audio</em> feature. Not all do—the same thing with Android. You’ll need compatible phones or earbuds for a feature like Samsung’s <em>Dual Audio</em>.</p><p>In 2020, Auracast was announced as a feature of the newer Bluetooth LE Audio standard, but it hasn’t yet seen wide adoption. We’ve written an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio" target="_blank">FAQ about Bluetooth LE</a> and even went <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">hands-on with Auracast at IFA 2024</a>.</p><p>The nuts and bolts of it are that it is a technology that works similarly to traditional radio towers, but instead of broadcasting a signal to your car stereo’s FM radio, a single smartphone can send out a stream that multiple people’s Bluetooth earbuds or headphones can all listen in on.</p><p>Most importantly, this technology has a lot of interest in the hearing-impaired community as it could be baked right into hearing aids, overcoming some of those devices' limitations in receiving public address audio. And it wouldn't just be smartphones broadcasting, but TVs in gyms, airport gates, the refs and commentators at live football games, and more.</p>

<p>In 2025, we may see much broader support for Auracast now that Google has baked it into the <em>Connected Devices</em> menu in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview</a>. Of all the audio technology I’m waiting on, this one is positioned to be the most profoundly impactful.</p><p>Everyone, from the hearing impaired to sports fans to those using public transportation, will benefit significantly from ubiquitous Auracast broadcast support in our smartphones and sound devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">And with excellent earbuds</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review" target="_blank">Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4</a> and the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 supporting Auracast</a>, this needs to happen post-haste.</p>

<p>While we're on the subject of Bluetooth codecs and technology, let's also address Hi-Res Audio.</p><p>High resolution is so much more immersive than the streaming files you’ll get from something like Spotify’s standard streams, so I’ve been watching eagerly as more wallet-friendly earbud and headphone options have emerged that support LDAC, LHDC, and aptX Lossless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="GS255FgwUqmuX4KUvzEzbB" name="spotify-wallpaper-fe0b.png" alt="Earbuds restiing on phone display, above the Spotify logo" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GS255FgwUqmuX4KUvzEzbB.png" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div></figure>
<p>As much as I love Tidal’s Max FLAC files and Apple’s ALAC files, the thing that will take public love of these highly engaging Bluetooth codecs to the next level is Spotify following through on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/years-later-spotify-still-says-its-working-on-super-premium-with-lossless-audio">what it’s been telling us for years</a> at this point and delivering their Hi-Fi streaming option.</p><p>I wouldn’t wait for it at this point, but if I’m being completely honest, like Shakira’s hips, the numbers don’t lie. Spotify has over 30% of the global market share, with its closest competitor being Tencent Music out of China, with only 14%, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/653926/music-streaming-service-subscriber-share/"><u>Statista</u></a>. According to the site, Spotify has 252 million premium subscribers as of the third quarter of 2024, with 640 million total active monthly users globally.</p><p>The best part about making this happen in 2025 is that great earbuds like the Nothing Ear, EarFun Air Pro 4, and Liberty Pro 4 offer great hardware and sonic experiences with hi-res wireless Bluetooth codec support at prices non-audiophiles can afford.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8Z42ZNk7kBw483tteqmm9H" name="Meta-Quest-3-hero.jpg" alt="Wearing a Meta Quest 3 headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Z42ZNk7kBw483tteqmm9H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Frankly, 2024 was phenomenal for us fitness enthusiasts who love the outdoors and want to push our limits to the beat of our favorite tunes. Open-ear audio took a huge leap forward with notable launches in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review" target="_blank">Nothing’s Ear Open</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review" target="_blank">Bose’s Ultra Open Earbuds.</a></p><p>The advance is bigger than that, though, with XR in the mix. Bluetooth earbuds are no good with XR platforms due to latency, so you need a dongle or USB-C headphones/earbuds to get synced audio. Some platforms like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> have open-ear speakers built into the frames, as do some newer AI glasses platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, and they’re pretty good.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v2py6YMqJLAjZDsYEjAKEX" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-transparent-01" alt="Taking the transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses out of its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2py6YMqJLAjZDsYEjAKEX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing proved you can create open-ear earbuds with great bass response, and Ray-Ban did a solid job building immersive sound into the frames of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again" target="_blank">Meta smart glasses</a>, so in 2025, I think we’ll see a greater proliferation of open-ear audio in XR applications, smart glasses, and as standalone wearables, but we won’t be saying, “these sound great… for open-ear.”</p>

<h2 id="the-generative-generation-2">The “Generative Generation”</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="EbAZhSRPM7TnUqmNtLjZQo" name="audible-app-pixel-buds-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Audible App Pixel Buds Lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EbAZhSRPM7TnUqmNtLjZQo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, with generative AI growing exponentially, we’ll see it a lot more in 2025. It’ll provide voiceover reads on websites if you want an article read to you (it’s already doing this), and it will be used by those in the audiobook industry to provide narration. But will it give me the emotion and uniqueness I get from human voice actors from various walks of life and backgrounds?</p><p>Is this the record vs CD debate all over again? The analog human voice with its warmth and texture vs the digitally generated voice? Time will tell, and I’ll be hesitant to embrace it, but I don’t think most people care too much and may not even notice the difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C" name="Gemini-2.0" alt="The Gemini 2.0 graphic provided by Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of “generative AI,” we’ll see further integrations of the new wave of AI agents powered by ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini and Gemini Nano on mobile. Having reviewed Nothing and Google earbuds, which support both natively, in 2025, they’ll need to be more functional.</p><p>Right now, you can ask them questions, and you can have a really cool back-and-forth with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones" target="_blank">Gemini Live,</a> but it’s missing much of the functionality that Google Assistant has on mobile. I can have a running conversation with Gemini Live, asking it to point me to the best chili fries when I’m visiting Houston, TX, but when I’ve decided upon one of its recommendations, it won’t automatically launch Google Maps and take me to that establishment.</p>

Android Automotive OS is one of the main things I’m <em>not</em> looking forward to in 2025. Tesla and Rivian have already eschewed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> and CarPlay connectivity, but the 2024 Chevy Blazer EV was GM's foray into telling the public they’re going another route as well, and they’d better get ready to pay up <em>after</em> the initial car purchase. That may mean that in addition to paying for your Tidal, Apple Music, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> subs, you’ll have to pay for a GM Android Automotive OS subscription to access your other subscriptions in the car.</p><p>The Blazer was just the beginning because that change is coming to all of GM's EVs.</p><p>GM integrated Android Automotive into the Blazer EV for “more advanced features,” but what it really wants is what it projects to be around $25 billion of additional revenue annually by 2030, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/what-carmakers-don-t-want-you-to-know-about-the-future-of-android-auto-and-carplay-243884.html" target="_blank">other car makers are taking notice, according to autoevolution.com.</a></p><p>What do you think about that? Would you pay to subscribe to an automotive OS so that you can have access to other things you already subscribe to built into your car without the need for a phone?</p>

<ul><li>Android Auto rolls out fixes to earlier reported issues like Wi-Fi error messages and stuttering audio issues.</li><li>The rollout has begun over the past couple of weeks, and it is advisable for users to stay on the latest Android Auto v13.3.</li><li>The company is also working on current Android Auto issues reported from the latest Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL models.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android Auto, in a recent community post, shared several new updates that it released this month, which will fix notable bugs that users have reported over the past few weeks.</p><p>The bugs include stuttering audio and Wi-Fi error messages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-auto-update-addresses-wi-fi-bug-and-stuttering-audio/?taid=67662130068c530001b0bbb7&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Android Police</a>). The company is also highlighting other bugs that it is working on, including those appearing for owners of devices like the latest Pixel 9 Pro. All sets of fixes and current bugs are shared on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/97890637/android-auto-known-issues-updated-12-20-2024?hl=en-GB&sjid=7304505883262554186-AP">Android Auto community site</a>.</p>
<p>One of the notable fixes, per the community post, is an error message stating that the phone does not support 5GHz Wi-Fi connections. The support team has evidently fixed this and encourages users facing the issue to update to the latest Android Auto v13.3 version.</p><p>Similarly, some users had reported wireless audio stuttering (while playing music or maps) when connected to Android Auto, and the latest version of the app has also addressed this issue.</p><p>While these are some of the notable fixes the company has rolled out over the past couple of weeks, the support team has further acknowledged some of the known issues reported by users this month, which the team is believed to be working on.</p>
<p>One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> owner reported no audio being played through a music streaming service via Android Auto since installing the December 2024 Android 15 feature drop on their device.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Starting with the OnePlus 3, OnePlus maintained a consistent design language. While the design of each subsequent phone changed, the overall aesthetic remained largely the same, with smooth curves and rounded edges characterized by a great in-hand feel. It's this familiarity combined with an obsessive focus on design that made using OnePlus phones enjoyable over the years. <br><br>After a decade, OnePlus is overhauling its design ethos with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/three-reasons-you-should-wait-for-the-oneplus-13-and-two-reasons-not-to">OnePlus 13</a>. Similar to most phones available today, the OnePlus 13 switches a boxier design, eschewing the flowing elegance of previous models. That said, the device comes with a vegan leather back (if you're getting the Midnight Ocean variant), and it looks highly interesting.<br><br>Ahead of the global launch, I talked to Ryan Ruan, head of OnePlus's Industrial Design Center, to get a better sense of the OnePlus 13's design and battery tech, and what the manufacturer is doing differently this time. The obvious starting point was the move to flat sides, and why OnePlus decided to alter the design. Ruan noted that OnePlus's design team "worked hard to make OnePlus 13 feel better in your hand than any other phone," investing a "significant amount of time in refining the transition between the front and back glass and the straight-edged frame" to deliver better durability and a device that still looks elegant. <br><br>Because OnePlus phones had dual-curved edges in the past, there was an increased chance of damage to the front or rear panes of glass if the device took a tumble and landed on an edge. Ruan said this was a point of contention with its users, and that OnePlus has been "continuously discussing and validating how to ensure a smooth overall curvature connection without compromising the device's drop resistance."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6o9zsFnrRY4rZ7bAewb855" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6o9zsFnrRY4rZ7bAewb855.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the OnePlus 13, Ruan said the goal was "for the transition surfaces to better conform to the natural curve of the user's palm while also providing a secure grip; to this end, we invested in the refinement and validation of nearly a hundred models" before settling on the final design for the OnePlus 13. <br><br>On the subject of durability, OnePlus says it decided to use a Microfiber Vegan Leather back to allow OnePlus 13 customers to use the device without a case. The vegan leather back is highly intriguing, as it uses a softer texture that hasn't been seen before on any phone. "We've fine-tuned the material composition and surface treatment to create an even more luxurious and durable texture that's also environmentally friendly," said Ruan. <br><br>"It's designed to offer a natural leather-like grip without compromising on style or sustainability. A lot of other leather-backed phones normally sacrifice the in-hand comfort just to guarantee daily durability. In the end, the leather may feel sort of plasticky (with a very rough texture). However, on the OnePlus 13, the microfiber vegan leather material is something we worked on for over a year; it guarantees good durability, and more importantly feels soft in your hand."<br><br>Ruan also stated that even though the Midnight Ocean model has a leather back, it doesn't interfere with wireless charging to any noticeable degree. "The thinness of the vegan leather back enables good proximity to the wireless charging coil, enhancing the charging efficiency. Meanwhile, the high-temperature resistance ensures that the phone can handle the slight increase in heat that can occur during wireless charging without any adverse effects."<br><br></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:38.77%;"><img id="4FtPnBYygaNmLQwSTZLt25" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4FtPnBYygaNmLQwSTZLt25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 has a flat AMOLED panel this time, but it includes 2.5D quad-curved edges with a "micro-curve ratio" that Ruan says will make a difference while using the device — at the same time negating accidental touches. Ruan said the micro-curve transition between the flat middle frame and the quad-curve glass ensures users don&apos;t get a sharp in-hand feeling, and guarantees a solid grip. "We chose to create a 2.8D screen which is designed to offer the visual appeal of a flat screen while also giving our users the smooth touch experience they get from a 3D screen."</p><p>Continuing with the in-hand feel, Ruan revealed that the OnePlus 13 has a 50:50 weight distribution, so even though it has a sizeable camera module, it isn&apos;t unwieldy to hold or use. "If you place your finger right under the OnePlus logo and support the phone, you&apos;ll find the phone doesn&apos;t lean towards one way or the other. That&apos;s because we introduce an evenly-split weight distribution. It requires our engineers to figure out a way to allocate more components in the lower half of the phone to balance the weight."<br>
<br>
Another interesting tidbit is that OnePlus is eschewing Coring&apos;s Gorilla Glass in favor of a custom Ceramic Guard solution on the OnePlus 13, with Ruan stating that it delivers "superior drop protection and scratch resistance. It&apos;s reinforced with nano crystalline, a material that significantly enhances its fracture toughness. The result is that the OnePlus 13 display is twice as resistant to drops compared to conventional cover glass."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SyXETuNXqQFPi2Nec3Rb75" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SyXETuNXqQFPi2Nec3Rb75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, the OnePlus 13 gets IP68 and IP69 resistance, with the latter designed to withstand high-pressure jets of water at up to 80 degrees Celsius. Interestingly, IP69 doesn't cover immersion in water, so manufacturers need to also have their devices tested for IP68 as well — that's why you see most 2025 phones having both IP68 and IP69. <br><br>One of the most exciting changes coming to 2025 phones is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon battery tech</a>, with most Chinese manufacturers using a silicon-carbon anode in their batteries to increase density and durability. The OnePlus 13 also has this tech, and the 6000mAh battery is dubbed OnePlus Silicon NanoStack. <br></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pwJEYxh2Hae8tqeuD44MB5" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pwJEYxh2Hae8tqeuD44MB5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's particularly interesting is that OnePlus is using a dual-cell configuration with the battery. Honor, OPPO, and Vivo use a single-cell battery on their devices, and by using two cells on the OnePlus 13, you get the best of both worlds — increased density, and fast 100W charging speeds. <br><br>Notably, the OnePlus 13 is using a 10% silicon-carbon anode, leading to an energy density of 805Wh/L, a heady 5.5% increase over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12">OnePlus 12</a>. That's why OnePlus is able to fit a bigger 6000mAh battery in the OnePlus 13 while still delivering a phone that's 10g lighter and 0.7mm thinner. <br><br>Ruan said the goal with the OnePlus 13 was to create a device with the best in-hand feel of any OnePlus phone to date, while ensuring it has better durability. Having used other devices that made a similar design transition — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> — in recent weeks, I'm excited to take a look at the OnePlus 13 and see if the manufacturer's claims actually hold up. I'll have much more to share about the OnePlus 13 as we head closer to the January 7 launch day, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>With just a few days to go until 2025, it's hard not to wonder what the future holds in store for accessories.</p><p>In the past, some of the most notable changes in the world of smartphone accessories have always been associated with the capabilities and characteristics of phones themselves. Revolutions in smartphones come and go, with record-breaking charging speeds and industry-shattering performance benchmarks met each year, and companion accessories come into play with these changes.</p><p>When it comes to accessories in 2025, I feel two main factors will reshape the landscape of the market: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tags/qi2">Qi2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Bluetooth Auracast</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2025-could-be-the-year-of-qi2-2">2025 could be the year of Qi2</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3716px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FUH6XoCW9usk5gsTBgQZAW" name="samsung-qi2-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="Mock Qi2 MagSafe ring on a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUH6XoCW9usk5gsTBgQZAW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3716" height="2090" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, I've been harping on about Qi2 for a while. I honestly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-samsung-galaxy-s24-series">thought the Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a> and the Google Pixel 9 lineup would be the first to take this leap. Of course, that did not happen. Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline</a> turned out to be the first phone in the world to adopt the standard. There are no other Qi2-integrated Android phones at the moment; however, I haven't given up on Qi2 yet.</p><p>According to prominent tipster Ice Universe, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-qi2-wireless-charging-support-rumors">Samsung Galaxy S25 series will finally come with Qi2</a> wireless charging. As we discovered during our testing with the S24 Ultra, MagSafe cases and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">magnetic accessories interfere with S Pen functionality</a>, so if this S25 rumor is true, it would require a massive undertaking on Samsung's part. The brand would need to reengineer the device's internals to fix this.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">rumor from Suomimobiili</a>, a Finnish tech news website, alleges that the S25 series will adopt the Qi2 standard but in an unexpected way. Apparently, Samsung will offer MagSafe cases for the Galaxy S25 lineup. This could mean two things: either Samsung will bring Qi2 to the S25 series, or it hopes that a magnetic phone cover can bridge that gap and bring magnetic wireless charging to its phones without native Qi2 compatibility.</p><p>As the world's top seller of smartphones, Samsung has the resources to make this a reality. If anyone can bring about the wider adoption of a new standard, it would definitely be Samsung — or Google. And now that hundreds, if not thousands, of Qi2 accessories, are so widely available, it only makes sense to launch a Qi2 phone now.</p>

<p>Like Qi2, Bluetooth Auracast isn't a new standard. The feature enables users to transmit audio playback to multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously. There are so many incredible ways this audio broadcast system can be utilized. Think Spotify Jam but local, without the need to use a specific app or have any sort of subscription or internet connection. Our managing editor, Derrek Lee, tested it at IFA 2024 and described it as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024" target="_blank">Bluetooth's final form</a>" because it was that impressive.</p><p>The perfect example of how Auracast can be so useful would be at an airport or a public space. If you're listening to a podcast or streaming some music, you might miss important announcements. But with Bluetooth Auracast broadcasts, these announcements could be made directly to your earbuds.</p><p>I can think of so many other scenarios where this could be a lifesaver. Imagine being on a road trip with friends, but you're all in a bus, train, or maybe even a plane. You could all jam along to the same songs without disturbing other passengers via Auracast. It'd be like a private jam session or concert that no one else can hear.</p><p>Although it has been two and a half years since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/bluetooth-auracast-broadcast-audio-announcement">Bluetooth SIG announced Auracast</a>, a public launch is still pending. I am confident that we will see the first Auracast phones in 2025. As with Qi2, there are tons of Auracast-ready audio accessories available now. Big-name brands like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/marshall-emberton-iii-review" target="_blank">Marshall have started adding Bluetooth Auracast</a> support to their new releases, and even smaller brands like EarFun are joining in.</p>
<hr>
<p>With both Qi2 and Bluetooth Auracast looming on the horizon, 2025 is going to be a very interesting year. One thing's for sure: accessory makers are going to continue to make more and more products that support both features. Let's see whether my predictions about the widespread adoption of both Qi2 and Auracast come to pass.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-82">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Meta is rumored to launch an updated version of its Ray-Ban smart glasses with a display that’ll show notifications and Meta AI responses, expected in late 2025.</li><li>The current model lacks a visual display, relying on audio and phone integration, but the new version will include a built-in screen.</li><li>The new glasses will feature a small screen for notifications and responses, but won’t be a full mixed-reality device—Meta’s Orion AR glasses are aiming for that in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta is reportedly preparing to launch an updated version of its Ray-Ban AR glasses with a display that’ll show notifications and replies from Meta AI.</p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/77bd9117-0a2d-4bd7-9248-4dd288f695a4" target="_blank">Financial Times</a>, Meta's new version of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> is expected to drop in the second half of 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/23/meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses-2025-report/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The current Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have a major downside: no visual feedback. Users can get audio responses from the digital assistant and view extra info on their phone, but the lack of a screen limits the overall experience. On the other hand, the upcoming third-gen model is expected to change that with a built-in display.</p><p>This move is right in line with Meta's grand plan to create lightweight, easy-to-wear devices that could eventually replace smartphones for everyday computing. The goal is a future where users can effortlessly access info, get things done faster, and interact with virtual assistants in a seamless, immersive way.</p><p>Sources close to Meta's plans say the new Ray-Ban smart glasses will feature a small screen mainly used for showing notifications and responses.</p><p>It’s pretty clear Meta isn’t aiming to make the new Ray-Ban smart glasses a full-on mixed-reality device. Toward that goal, the company is working on the Orion AR glasses, a slick prototype that’s still a few years away from being available to the public.</p><p>We’re not sure how adding a display in the line of sight will affect the design, but the current setup has its charm. It lets users capture photos and videos effortlessly, share them straight to Meta platforms, and enjoy audio through the built-in speakers.</p><p>Meta is focused on cementing its lead in the growing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses market</a>. With heavyweights like Apple and Google eyeing their own entry into the space, the competition is heating up. According to FT, Meta sees this new platform as the next big leap in tech, one that could eventually replace smartphones as the main way we interact with technology.</p><p>The Ray-Ban smart glasses have earned a lot of praise, and it’s no surprise. They look great, and with features like in-ear speakers, sharp cameras, and quick access to Meta’s virtual assistant, they deliver.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Drive just rolled out a handy new feature that allows for instant video playback right after uploading on the web, so you can finally get rid of those frustrating wait times.</p><p>In a recent Workspace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/12/release-notes-12-20-2024.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google announced that instant video playback on the web is now live. The company didn’t dive into the technical details, but it’s clear the changes work like a charm.</p><p>Before this update, uploading videos to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-drive-tips-and-tricks">Google Drive</a> meant waiting for them to go through a transcoding process. Basically, the videos had to be converted into a streaming-friendly format for Drive’s player. This step often took forever, leaving creators stuck waiting instead of diving right in.</p><p>From now on, you can start watching videos as soon as they’re done uploading to Google Drive.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-92">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The OnePlus Open 2's launch keeps getting pushed back, with a late 2025 release now looking likely.</li><li>Initially, the delay was thought to be for Qualcomm’s latest chipset, but now it seems like unexpected development issues are causing the holdup.</li><li>The OnePlus Open 2 is expected to come with major upgrades, including a better rear camera, hardware, and a bigger battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> feels endless, and now it seems the launch might be pushed back even further, which is a bummer for anyone itching to see the next-gen foldable from OnePlus.</p><p>Tipster Sanju Choudhary claims on X that the OnePlus Open 2 might not hit store shelves until late 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_open_2_may_arrive_later_than_previously_rumored-news-65827.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). Details are scarce, but it looks like fans of OnePlus’ foldables are in for a long wait.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The OnePlus OPEN 2 is 🔥 ....H2 2025..<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1870094317374640134">December 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Earlier reports suggested that the Open 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-may-have-a-launch-window-lined-up-for-its-next-foldable-phone">could debut as early as Q1 2025</a>, but that’s still far off from earlier speculations. At this point, a 2024 launch seems pretty much off the table.</p><p>At first, it seemed like the Open 2 was delayed to pack in Qualcomm’s latest chipset. But this new setback hints at unexpected development issues slowing things down even more.</p><p>These rumors are still up in the air until OnePlus makes it official. While the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> launched in October 2023, that doesn’t give us much to go on for its sequel. OnePlus’ release schedules can shift due to all kinds of factors, making past launches a shaky guide for what’s next.</p><p>The next OnePlus foldable is rumored to bring big upgrades to its rear camera and hardware, making the wait totally worth it.</p><p>Previous rumors suggested the Open 2 could be the first foldable in the U.S. to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, that is, if it drops in early 2025.</p><p>Reports also say the OnePlus Open 2 will pack an impressive battery, outdoing any foldable before it. Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-resistance-rating-camera-specs-tipped">expect a thinner design and better durability</a>, with the device being thinner and more water-resistant than the last one. These upgrades are definitely cranking up the hype.</p><p>Meanwhile, Oppo is expected to reveal the Find N5 next year, likely with the same hardware as the OnePlus Open 2. Given the parallel launch of the Find N3 and the original OnePlus Open last year, we could see both foldables debut around the same time in the next 12 months.</p>

<ul><li>Google has reportedly delivered its proposal to the DOJ's suggestion for it to sell off Chrome due to anti-competitive practices.</li><li>Seeing the DOJ's proposal as "extreme," Google suggests a better remedy would be to let other companies make "multiple" deals and choices available for users.</li><li>This all started after a landmark ruling claimed Google was an illegal search monopoly in July, thus provoking the DOJ's hand in forcing the selling of Chrome, Android, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The U.S. has continued to probe into Google's dominance with Chrome and a recent development sees the company rebuttal.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is looking into Google's alleged anticompetitive practices with Chrome, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/2024.12.20_1108_Executive_Summary_of_Google_Proposed_Final_Judgment.pdf">a recent filing</a> expresses the company's disagreement with the government's proposal, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-21/google-blasts-chrome-sale-as-extreme-remedy-at-odds-with-law?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Google's vice president for regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-remedies-proposal-dec-2024/">stated that any sort of "remedy"</a> to the situation should involve letting other browsers have the freedom to "do deals with whatever search engine they think is best for their users." Additionally, Mulholland expressed Google's second browser agreement solution, which involves allowing the competition to leverage Search for both the user and their revenue.</p><p>Google states it seeks "flexibility" rather than the DOJ's proposal. As such, the company says its solution would allow for "multiple default agreements across different platforms." As an example, Google states Apple could provide a different search engine <em>and </em>browser on its iPhones and iPads. What's more, companies could swap their "default" every 12 months.</p><p>The solutions put forth by Google in its recent filing regard the DOJ's "extreme remedies." Of course, the company is referring to the U.S. government's suggestion for Google to sell Chrome. An excerpt from Google's document states, "...courts must take care to avoid decrees that “could wind up impairing rather than enhancing competition."</p><p>It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">reported in mid-November</a> that the Department of Justice and the presiding judge, Amit Mehta, have sought to force Google to sell Chrome for anti-competitive practices. This follows the government's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">landmark ruling</a> that the company broke Section 2 of the Sherman Act, turning it into an illegal search monopoly.</p><p>It's because of this that the DOJ is pushing Google to sell significant parts of its business — and Chrome, alongside Android, is wrapped in it. Regarding Chrome, government lawyers claim Google has "boxed out" the competition and has stifled rival incentives.</p><p>As Bloomberg notes, a final decision isn't on the table until August 2025 at the latest. However, if Google does have to sell Chrome, the internet will remain, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">but the players will change</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-things-to-note-about-adding-your-passport-to-google-wallet-2">A few things to note about adding your passport to Google Wallet</h2>
<p>As noted, you will still need to bring your physical passport for travel since an ID pass is not a government-issued ID nor a replacement for your physical one. ID passes do not support international travel, but they should work with TSA security for domestic travel within the U.S. at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/digital-id/map" target="_blank">selected supported airports</a>.</p><p>Which airports does this include? See the list linked above, but note that this includes select locations within each state, such as the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas, the Los Angeles International Airport in California, both John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York, and others.</p><p>The feature is also only available in the U.S. for now, but it’s possible we may see it expanded to other countries passports and locations in the future.</p><p>Users are required to have an Android phone with OS 9.0 or higher and must have Bluetooth and Nearby devices on in order for it to work. It’s crucial that you set a screen lock in order to use this feature as well, which is an added security measure.</p><p>You can’t link your passport to an existing ID pass on Google Wallet. You will need to create a new one. But once you do, you’ll love the convenience of having an ID that’s accepted in certain places to confirm your age and country of residence. The best part is that virtually all of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> support Google Wallet.</p><p>Finally, if you decide you no longer want to have a digital version of your passport in Google Wallet, select your ID pass in Google Wallet, select More (the three vertical dots), and select Remove and Remove again. You can also do this remotely at <strong>myaccount.google.com</strong>. Go to your Personal Info, select IDs, Manage IDs, find and select the passport, select Delete, and then confirm the deletion a second time.</p>
