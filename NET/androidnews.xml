<p>Although Samsung&apos;s A Series never gets as much press attention as the OEM&apos;s flagships, these midrange devices typically make up a huge chunk of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> sold every year, and it isn&apos;t hard to see why when you look at the specs. The new Galaxy A36 5G, for instance, boasts a gorgeous 6.7-inch FHD display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1,200 nits of brightness, while under the hood you&apos;ll enjoy an efficient Octa-core processor and 5,000mAh battery.

<ul><li>YouTube is beginning a notification test that will impact users who've selected to receive "All" alerts from channels.</li><li>The platform states if a user hasn't engaged with that channel "recently," it will no longer push notifications to them to avoid further issues.</li><li>YouTube ran a limited test earlier in February for Premium users, giving them 4x watch speed, while it rolled out more radio station customization options in YouTube Music.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is kickstarting a new test on the platform that focuses on how its notifications interact with users and channel creators.</p><p>The platform updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&msgid=333836208">its experiment changelog</a> recently, stating it's playtesting a revamped "notifications experience" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/new-youtube-push-notification-experiment/">Android Police</a>). YouTube states it's trying to reduce the number of times users "turn off all notifications" from the platform within Settings, instead of changing the specific channel's behavior. Users are reportedly more likely to do this when overwhelmed with notifications. To solve this, YouTube says its test involves users who've selected "All" notifications for any given channel.</p><p>Specifically, the app will not push a notification to you, despite the "All" option selected, if you haven't interacted with that channel "recently." The test will still make those newly uploaded video notifications available via the bell icon in the app, but they won't appear on your phone as an alert.</p><p>Additionally, YouTube is testing this notification change for channels that "upload infrequently."</p><p>The test started this week, but the platform doesn't say how far the experiment will go. So, some users may notice this as we end the week, while others may not.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-youtube-app.jpg" alt="The YouTube app listing on the Google Play Store, running on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube offers three types of notification settings for channels: All, Personalized, and None. The latter is self-explanatory; however, "All" notifications lets you know everything uploaded by that channel. This involves regular videos, streams, and Shorts. "Personalized" restricts that slightly. The secondary option will alert you about "some" uploads, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3382248?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#zippy=%2Cchange-notification-settings">but YouTube states</a> it uses your interactions with that channel to determine what it should inform you about.</p><p>Regarding experiments, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-new-experimental-features-4x-speeds-and-jump-ahead">YouTube highlighted one</a> in February that lets Premium users test watching videos at 4x speed. It was a limited test run as the platform only made it available for Premium users until February 26. That same test included more for the Jump Ahead feature, which “enables viewers to get to the content they care about faster.”</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube Music's "Ask Music" picks up extra support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-musics-personalized-radio-stations-are-getting-even-smarter">more personalized radio stations</a>. Users can tweak their custom channels with written or voice prompts. Additionally, the company will offer a few suggested prompts like "just jazz songs" or "only female vocals."</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted testing a new set of text-based options for images captured using Circle to Search.</li><li>These choices will appear in the provided AI Overview and will let users summarize or extract text found within the photo, as well as an "explain" option.</li><li>Google highlighted AI Overviews for Circle to Search earlier in 2025 when the Galaxy S25 debuted.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google might have a few upgrades for Circle to Search and how it delivers results for users.</p><p>In an APK dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-new-text-chips-ai-overviews-3539092/">Android Authority</a>, the publication reportedly discovered a trio of new options for Circle to Search during a query. What was discovered — three new "chips" — supposedly concern any AI Overviews that appear when capturing "lengthy text" in Circle to Search. In the provided demo, the company highlighted the three new options: Explain text from image, Summarize, and Extract.</p><p>To "explain," the overview highlights it as a news article, as well as its title and who the post was written by. The AI-generated blurb also links to the website the snapshot is from but not the article itself.</p><p>What's more, the overview gets a little detailed about the images, too, explaining what all is present as best as it can.</p><p>The summarization feature for captured Circle to Search snapshots seemingly took in more than was actually captured. In the demo, the publication only highlighted one specific title; however, the summarization feature knew more and briefly mentioned several more posts on the page. It's more likely this feature will function similarly to how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-tl-dr-summaries-in-drive-update">Gemini's summarization</a> function works in other places.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="5b8Jb95ax8XHhrYaMnb2mU" name="google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-text-chips" alt="Google is reportedly working to bring three text-based actions in AI Overviews when using Circle to Search, dubbed summarize, explain, and extract." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5b8Jb95ax8XHhrYaMnb2mU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The "extraction" chip merges its base function with a smaller summary. In short, the AI Overview will attempt to extract several text-based elements from the Circle to Search photo in a semi-organized way. Since the publication took a photo from a website, the overview broke things down into "Top Section," "News Section," and "Bottom Section (Phone Screen)" categories.</p><p>Right now, the new chips were spotted in the Google app's beta v16.11.36. The post speculates these chips could arrive when scanning items with Google Lens, but nothing's confirmed as the company pushes through development.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Overviews in Circle to Search</a> captured imagery were announced earlier this year with the Galaxy S25 series. The AI-based blurbs will explain what the image is with a few key bullet points and citations for fact-checking (per usual). However, users retain the ability to add a written query alongside the image after the overview appears.</p><p>Also, it seems what's been discovered in the latest Google app beta is yet another expansion of the company's "one-tap actions." Originally, these quicker functions involved identifying/calling phone numbers, email addresses, and URLs. Google said during January's update that if its overview detects one of these aspects, users will see a chip they can tap to quickly visit a website or contact its personnel.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Qualcomm is nearing a big decision. It's reportedly gearing up to release a new, midrange Snapdragon chip. While this "budget" SoC is rumored to be powered by Arm cores — not the custom Oryon cores powering other Elite chips — it's unclear whether the company will still use "Elite" branding. We've seen reports use both Snapdragon 8s Elite and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-might-ditch-the-elite-tag-and-go-with-snapdragon-8s-gen-4-for-its-next-chip">Snapdragon 8s Gen 4</a> to refer to the unannounced mobile chip.</p><p>The problem? The custom Oryon CPU cores are what make Snapdragon 8 Elite chips, well, "elite." Let's review how we got here.</p>
<h2 id="the-switch-from-arm-to-oryon-2">The switch from Arm to Oryon</h2>
<p>Last year, Qualcomm finally achieved its breakthrough moment. It launched the Snapdragon X lineup of laptop and desktop-class systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) in June 2024 that would eventually disrupt the stronghold competitors AMD and Intel had on personal computing. Then, Qualcomm used what it learned to develop the Snapdragon X platform and brought it to mobile with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>.</p><p>By now, I've had the chance to review and test multiple Snapdragon X and Snapdragon 8 Elite laptops and phones, respectively. They're both as good as advertised. Snapdragon X brought excellent power efficiency and responsiveness to Windows laptops, and Snapdragon 8 Elite brought massive year-over-year performance improvements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC" name="oneplus-13-blue-snapdragon-8-elite-01" alt="A blue OnePlus 13 with a Snapdragon 8 Elite placard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oryon cores are the secret to Qualcomm's major success. The company used its own custom Oryon cores instead of off-the-shelf designs from Arm to make the Snapdragon X, Snapdragon X Plus, and Snapdragon X Elite SoCs. Essentially, it followed the same blueprint Apple used when designing its own silicon.</p><p>A quick look at Qualcomm's PC processors reveals that chips with Oryon cores don't always use the Elite brand. That's reserved for Qualcomm's best PC chips, while budget versions with slower clock speeds and/or fewer cores use names like Snapdragon X and Snapdragon X Plus.</p><p>But we've never seen a Qualcomm chip branded with the Elite tag that doesn't use custom Oryon cores. Although there are conflicting reports about whether the next Snapdragon 8s mobile processor will get a "Gen 4" or "Elite" brand name, the right option seems clear.</p><p>Qualcomm should name the unreleased midrange chip Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 to avoid consumer confusion and keep the Elite brand sacred for the company's standout processors — those with Oryon cores.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-qualcomm-s-next-midrange-chip-be-called-2">What will Qualcomm's next midrange chip be called?</h2>
<p>Right now, there's no official word on what Qualcomm will call the next Snapdragon 8s chip. One rumor from reputable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1902269621266255889" target="_blank">Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter)</a> earlier this month said that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm/the-first-snapdragon-8s-elite-phones-could-launch-next-month-leaker-claims">the SoC was "set to launch soon</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm/the-first-snapdragon-8s-elite-phones-could-launch-next-month-leaker-claims">"</a> referring to it as Snapdragon 8s Elite. More recently, a tip from Digital Chat Station this week on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pk8WP9umB" target="_blank">Weibo</a> called the unreleased chip the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4.</p><p>Although both rumored names are only speculation at this point, one seems more fitting than the other.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="46UHHatjXep5JgAVYnLqx7" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-01" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite placard at a press event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/46UHHatjXep5JgAVYnLqx7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's because current leaks claim to reveal the upcoming Snapdragon 8s chip's core structure, and custom Oryon cores are absent. According to Digital Chat Station, this processor has a model number of SN8735. It is said to be headlined by a 3.21GHz Cortex-X4 Prime Core, plus three more 3.01GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores. The SoC is also expected to include two 2.02GHz Cortex-A720 efficiency cores.</p><p>If this configuration turns out to be accurate, the Snapdragon 8s chip will use standard Arm designs rather than Qualcomm's best Oryon cores. This isn't a bad thing, because the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is expensive, and the "s" variant is supposed to be cheaper. However, it does mean that the Elite branding wouldn't exactly make sense for this particular SoC.</p>
<h2 id="qualcomm-is-rumored-to-make-the-right-move-2">Qualcomm is rumored to make the right move</h2>
<p>Qualcomm is a very large company operating in many different verticals, from cellular modems to smartphone and desktop chips. Under those circumstances, it's easy for naming schemes to get convoluted. Just look at what Intel and Sony have done over the years, releasing products like the Intel Core i9 14900K or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH-1000XM5</a>.</p><p>Luckily, Qualcomm seems to be aware of how important branding is for consumer clarity. At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC Barcelona 2025</a>, it introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-dragonwing-for-enterprise-products-announced">a new naming scheme</a> for its vast portfolio of products. Qualcomm will be used for general products, like modems, with the Snapdragon brand serving consumer products and the Dragonwing brand covering the enterprise market.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SPZiqduU9qWPUXB9Jcd65n" name="Snapdragon-logo-water" alt="The Snapdragon logo sitting above water in a pool next to the ocean in Maui" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPZiqduU9qWPUXB9Jcd65n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm may be set up for an interesting decision. On the one hand, using the name Snapdragon 8s Elite would make it clear that the to-be-released chip is part of the same generation as the Snapdragon 8 Elite. On the other hand, using the name Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 would make it clear that the chip isn't using custom Oryon cores.</p><p>Only time will tell which name Qualcomm will end up using. Personally, I'm voting for the next Snapdragon 8s SoC to be called the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. While the Elite nomenclature is an excellent brand, it's too good to be diluted. Currently, every Elite chip features Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores, and I think it should stay that way.</p>

<hr>
<p>It seems Samsung's 2024 flagship phones are in for one more software beta before the big day arrives.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1904789984533766231">Tarun Vats on X</a> states Samsung is reportedly starting to roll out One UI 7 Beta 6 to enrolled Galaxy S24 devices in its Beta Program (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-one-ui-7-beta-6-released/">SamMobile</a>). The patch was brought to the tipster's attention on social media via another user, who claims it's been spotted in India. The latest beta version rocks firmware version ZYCE; however, the publiction states it's also been appearing for phones "globally" in the program.</p><p>Interestingly, the changelog is a little familiar. According to Vats' snapshot, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24 series</a> is picking up new One UI 7 features like a "press and hold" function to launch its digital assistant.</p><p>There are also several AI-based features arriving on the most recent past-gen series:</p>
<ul><li>Call recording summary converted to text</li><li>Create your own stickers and images</li><li>Summarize webpages</li><li>Edit video sounds</li><li>Natural language-based search in Settings</li></ul>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy S24 receives the One UI 7 beta 6 update in India.Build version: S928BXXU4ZYCE/S928BOXM4ZYCE/S928BXXU4BYCERepost pic.twitter.com/0F8SEykG02<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1904789984533766231">March 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Samsung is fixing a few bugs on the S24 series regarding its battery animations and UI errors in its media controller.</p><p>If these "new features" hitting the S24 series seem familiar, it's because Samsung recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-3-rolling-out">brought the same set</a> to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6's beta. That patch for the foldables was roughly 1.2GB in size. There's a chance users with the S24 series could see a similar size, considering the update's strong similarities. Moreover, the changelog's mention of "editing video sounds" and sticker/image creation points us to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a> AI features.</p><p>The latter was mentioned during Samsung's teasers earlier this year, where the company said it wanted the feature to be more "multimodal." Users will have the choice of using an S Pen, written descriptions, or their voice with the AI to generate an image.</p><p>As previously stated, there's speculation that this could be the final beta the Galaxy S24 sees before Samsung's official debut of One UI 7. With six betas under our belt, the company is preparing to rollout the new sofware upgrade <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">on April 10 in the U.S.</a>, three days after it goes global. Something to keep in mind is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-schedule-galaxy-dates-spotted-overseas">a rollout schedule</a> for the update that appeared on the company's Czech Republic website.</p><p>Users in the region are seemingly receiving the update for the Galaxy S24, Flip 6, and Fold 6 on April 10 — like the U.S., but it's unclear if the remainder of the schedule is what we should expect. It states the Galaxy S24 FE, S23 series, Flip 5, and Fold 5 should receive it "a week later" alongside more important dates for other devices.</p>

It boasts a large, great-looking 6.9-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, along with 12GB of RAM and a Snapdragon 8 Elite CPU. This particular deal is for the 512GB storage configuration, though you can also save a little more money by downgrading to either the 256GB or 128GB version.</p>

The screen also features a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, making performance quick and smooth as supported by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB of RAM. As for cameras, buyers will get a wide range of options for crisp photos and videos, using the onboard telephoto, ultrawide, and wide lenses.</p><p>The S25 Ultra also supports the Samsung S Pen, unlike this generation's base-level S25 and Plus models. However, it's worth noting that Samsung for some reason dropped support for Bluetooth and Air Action features for the S Pen with this release, which could be a dealbreaker for some.</p>

<ul><li>Fitbit is refreshing the Health Metrics page on mobile to feature a new look that matches the rest of the app.</li><li>The Health Metrics UI is also changing, ditching the "Today" and "Trends" views.</li><li>There's now a focus on the individual health metrics, and you can find more detailed data by tapping a specific metric.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit">Fitbit app</a> on Android and iOS has a Health Metrics page for data points like breathing rate, resting heart rate, blood oxygen, heart rate variability, and skin temperature variation. While the Health Metrics page used to be a basic user-interface that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-design-fitbit-app-redesign">didn't match the bulk of the Fitbit app</a>, that's changing in an update. Aside from getting a new look, the Health Metrics UI is tweaked to make it easier to view your data, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/27/fitbit-health-metrics-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>While the preview card on the main Fitbit app homepage isn't new, tapping it brings you to a fresh Health Metrics page. Here, you'll see a list of the five health metrics recorded, and a quick gauge of how many of those metrics are in your "personal range." In a new change, only the "Today" stats are shown on the main Health Metrics page.</p><p>To see longer-term data, you'll need to tap a specific metric individually. This will bring up a detailed view with graphs and data spanning the past week, month, and year intervals. This page also explains each data point and its significance, with a <strong>Learn more</strong> tab for users to get more information.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1854px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.28%;"><img id="UiPkkxcZur78WtH7Ba3DAV" name="Fitbit-Health-Metrics-UI-New" alt="The new look for Health Metrics on the Fitbit app for iOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UiPkkxcZur78WtH7Ba3DAV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1854" height="1340" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Previously, you could see this data by switching to the "Trends" tab in Health Metrics. Instead of the "Today" and "Trends" tab structure, there's now a new focus on sorting data and views by the metrics themselves.</p><p>The update is rolling out as part of version 4.39 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbit-health-fitness/id462638897" target="_blank">Fitbit app for iOS</a>, which was released last week. The latest version of the Fitbit app hit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitbit.FitbitMobile" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> on Monday, March 24, but not everyone is seeing the latest Health Metrics changes yet.</p>

<p>Recently, though, we've been using a Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S to play VR games together, and they've made some of the most memorable date nights in recent years. We've played minigolf on the peak of Mount Olympus. Had tea among the spires at Shangri-La. Stood together under a massive Christmas tree and admired a little village. We even painted together while watching a Bob Ross video, all without making a huge mess.</p><p>It was an experiment I tried at the end of 2024 when I gave my wife a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S </a>and a copy of Walkabout Mini Golf for Christmas. My wife loved playing Beat Saber back in the day, but we haven't had regular VR gaming sessions as a couple in a few years. Thankfully, she loved it, and we've been playing at least weekly since the experiment began.</p><p>It's a great alternative to watching TV or reading books — although those are great when we just want to relax after a busy day — but there's something amazing about being able to go somewhere with your significant other after a busy day without having to hire a babysitter for the kids.</p>

<p>Spending an evening on top of the Eiffel Tower isn't something you normally get the chance to do on a regular basis. Some people may never visit the iconic landmark in their lives, but we've been twice now and haven't been late to bed thanks to Walkabout Mini Golf, one of the best Meta Quest games you can find.</p><p>This truly is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/walkabout-minigolf-meta-quest-mars-gardens">one of the most creative games I've ever played</a>. It's ironic that a mini golf game is a good reason to buy a Meta Quest headset, but I promise it's the system seller you never knew you needed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/walkabout-mini-golf/2462678267173943/">base game is $14.99</a> and comes with eight 18-hole courses, each of which features a gorgeous setting with unique music and entrancing vibes.</p>

<p>My wife was instantly drawn to the Cherry Blossom course, which features a normal difficulty daytime course and a gorgeous nighttime hard course, complete with glowing lanterns, illuminated Zen gardens, and an intriguing "fox hunt" to complete to get a special putter.</p><p>Fox hunts involve finding objects hidden throughout each course and then following clues to help you find the next. Each hard course has a unique putter, including all the DLC courses available, meaning you can find over 20 putters that can be used at any time in the future. These are excellent date night activities and genuinely a ton of fun!</p>

<p>The pace and beauty of Walkabout Mini Golf are beyond perfect for date night at home. You can take your time hitting each putt, stand together and admire the sights, or go on a hunt for all 18 golf balls on each of the game's normal difficulty courses. My wife and I even sat and had tea as we overlooked the cliffs of Shangri-La, one of over 20 DLC courses that cost $3 to $4 apiece, and each contains 36 holes of mini golfing.</p><p>Some courses now have a separate slingshot course, which adds a whole new dimension and set of challenges. Plus, fun modifiers like mini mode give you a new perspective on each course, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz8pZEHKQsk">leafblower mode</a> can even be used to make your own versions of minigolf if you so choose.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LMVv2WRBvgCVTZNvXsodcL" name="walkabout-mini-golf-screenshot-shangri-la-01" alt="A screenshot of the Shangri-La course in Walkabout Mini Golf on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LMVv2WRBvgCVTZNvXsodcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Getting set up in the game is easy since all you'll need to do is make a room name and have the other person join. No need for complicated friend list systems or making accounts, and anyone can play any course <em>you</em> own without having to buy it for themselves so long as they tag along with you. The only restriction is that they won't be able to hunt for the special golf balls or collect the special putter unless they own it.</p><p>New courses come out roughly every 6-8 weeks, ensuring that you have just enough time to master one before the next one comes out. There are over 20 courses, each with 36 holes of golfing, so it'll take quite a long time to see and do everything.</p><p>And since they're only around $4 each, you can get away with grabbing a fancy drink from the store and spending $8 for each of you to have the course, making it a very inexpensive date, indeed!</p>

<p>As Valentine's Day approached, I started looking for something unique to do for this year's celebration. I had used the painting app Vermillion on the Meta Quest before but hadn't used its multiplayer mode before. After chatting with a few folks about how it works, I dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/vermillion-vr-painting/4900967296622279/">$20 on a second copy</a> so my wife could paint with me and planned an entire evening out of it.</p><p>I set up two dining room chairs in the living room, roughly 8 feet apart, giving each of us plenty of room to place our easel stand, brush stand, and palette table on the floor. Of course, these objects are all virtual and take up no physical space, but they felt like they were physically there because of Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S's color mixed reality vision.</p><p>Vermillion is one of the many Meta Quest games that supports mixed reality and co-located spaces, meaning my wife and I could see each other virtually painting as we sat in the same room.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qdsi4vTbqyfyDaj65GzVxY" name="vermillion-screenshot-meta-quest-3" alt="Painting in mixed reality in Vermillion on the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qdsi4vTbqyfyDaj65GzVxY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>If you (or your partner) have ever wanted to paint to Bob Ross but were afraid of the equipment investment or making a mess, Vermillion is a brilliant place to start.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The game has a browser built-in with preset bookmarks for Bob Ross videos, as well as several other famous TV artists who teach you how to paint anything from landscapes to portraits, flowers, pets, or just about anything else you want.</p><p>Vermillion is an oil painting simulator but features several modern digital niceties that Adobe users will immediately feel comfortable with. The game sports 10 brush types, plus a palette knife so you can get started on mountainscapes just like Bob Ross.</p><p>Those digital niceties I spoke of include an eyedropper tool so you can easily replicate any color in the canvas, layers that allow you to separately paint layers on top of your digital canvas — so the virtual oil doesn't mix — plus "easy mode" features like undo and redo buttons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uaZsjNmR5RLzWwpHS4KuZU" name="vermillion-screenshot-palette-meta-quest-3" alt="The paint palette with oils in Vermillion on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uaZsjNmR5RLzWwpHS4KuZU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mixing the oils on the paint palette feels surprisingly natural. Colors can be spread anywhere you want on your palette, and the default colors are similar to what you'll find in most Bob Ross videos, although alternatives are available. There's even a handy "clear palette" button that'll let you totally start over from scratch when you're ready to move on to the next set of colors.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Oil painting in Vermillion is incredibly authentic, yet easy, thanks to some modern tools like layers and an undo button.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If you make a mistake while painting or need to start over, just grab the rag, dip it in some paint thinner, and wipe away the accident. Of course, if you're a real Bob Ross fan, accidents don't need to be erased. They're happy little accidents and can be turned into something joyful and fun, which is the entire point of painting like this, anyway.</p><p>Once you've finished up and are ready to show off your creation, it's as easy as opening up the menu and hitting the export button. You'll get a selection of choices that include saving the painting as its own file or displaying it in a virtual gallery frame inside the saved image.</p><p>And don't worry if painting seems a little overwhelming at first. There's an entire paint-by-numbers section in the menu that makes it easy to learn the ropes and make something beautiful without feeling like you need to make something perfect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:37.50%;"><img id="5Mmg3dFNRzewfzKM3YXM7k" name="vermillion-screenshot-paintings-meta-quest-3" alt="Paintings of mountains made in Vermillion on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Mmg3dFNRzewfzKM3YXM7k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="768" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both of us were impressed with the quality of the images the game exports, although it seems that the PC version offers more export options so you can get your painting printed on larger canvases after digitally painting them. The game also lets you export it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamVR/comments/pfuyfk/export_beautifully_varnished_3d_models_of_your/">as a 3D model</a> so you can import it into metaverse-like apps like VR Chat or Resonite, or even use the 3D models in different creative ways.</p><p>The developer regularly posts to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/vermillionvr">the game's Facebook group</a>, and users post their latest paintings all the time. It's a great place to get inspiration or to just find the next video you want to follow along.</p>
<h2 id="give-virtual-dates-a-try-2">Give virtual dates a try</h2>
<p>I hope these two at-home date ideas helped inspire you to try it for yourself. My wife finds her Meta Quest 3S very comfortable during these sessions because I've got it equipped with an aftermarket head strap and face pad from our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> list.</p><p>I'd also recommend picking up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Virtual-Baseball-Controller-Attachment-Simulator/dp/B0D9Y665YV/">Yoges Meta Quest 3 golf club</a> attachment to give your controller the real feel of a club while mini-golfing. It makes a crazy difference and makes the date feel even more authentic!</p>

<p>Like many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> out there, the Beats Studio Pro are all about putting the listener into the driver&apos;s seat. You get fancy features like active noise cancellation, head tracking, and spatial audio support straight out of the box, but the value really shines through the headphones&apos; potential for personalization. You get a ton of customizable EQ options through the companion Beats app, plus three pre-installed sound profiles — Beats Signature, Entertainment, and Conversation. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2592px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bkTobtLC23H9BbiATv9Pmj" name="beats-studio-pro-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Beats Studio Pro lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bkTobtLC23H9BbiATv9Pmj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2592" height="1458" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Beats by Dre)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beats Signature is meant to provide the classic listening experience for audiophiles, utilizing the Studio Pro&apos;s 40mm drivers and dynamic head tracking to deliver super-immersive sound, regardless of genre. The Entertainment profile, on the other hand, automatically adjusts to optimize the sound of movies, TV shows, and games, while the Conversation preset is meant for phone calls and meetings.</p><p>Now, I&apos;ll be real with you: given the age of the Beats Studio Pro (the headphones dropped in 2023), I wouldn&apos;t pay full price at this point. You could easily take that $350 and buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony XM5</a> instead for a considerably better experience all around. But pair these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">noise-cancelling headphones</a> with nearly 50% off AND three free months of Apple Music? That&apos;s pretty much a no-brainer recommendation from me.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted a series of updates for AI and apps that might help users travel this summer.</li><li>AI Overviews will soon help users build itineraries for traveling to new places with activities that can span several days.</li><li>The company also detailed trending international and domestic places users have been searching for in Flights in 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Get ready for the weekend with a few updates for Google's AI and apps that will prepare you for a summer full of traveling.</p><p>In a press release, the company detailed the start of these updates for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">its AI Overviews in Search</a>. Google says "starting this week," users can begin receiving "trip ideas" for cities, as well as "distinct" regions and entire countries. To get started, Google gives the following example: "create an itinerary for Costa Rica with a focus on nature."</p><p>The company's AI software in Search will return a map for users to browse. Additionally, you'll find photos and reviews from others who've visited the area and engaged in activities similar to what you're interested in. The AI Overview will also break down what activities it thinks you could partake in throughout your stay in a given region/country.</p><p>This feature will soon rollout for English-based user queries in the U.S. on mobile and desktop. What's more, Google says users can export their AI-generated itinerary to share with others — which could be helpful if you're traveling with people.</p><p>Alternatively, Google says you could even leverage Gemini for some travel plan assistance. Users can ask the AI model for cheap hotels or "affordable activities" to do in a given country and see what it returns. Moreover, it highlights the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gems-tips/">utilize its Gems feature</a>, which lets users tailor Gemini to their specific needs.</p>

<p>With a place in mind, the company says users will soon find the ability to "track prices" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="google.com/hotels">for hotels</a> after finding a plane through Google Flights. A new option to track prices for your chosen destination and planned stay will soon appear. Google recommends users tap the "price-tracking toggle" within the search filters in Hotels to receive email notifications if/when things change.</p><p>Hotel price tracking is said to begin rolling out "globally this week" on mobile and desktop.</p><p>Once you've arrived, Google Maps might be your best friend in that wonderous new place if you've been doing a bit of research. The post highlights a new Maps feature called "screenshot." If enabled, Maps will leverage its Gemini capabilities to scour through your saved screenshots so you can review and save any useful ones into a comprehensive list. That list of places can then be shared with others with whom you may be traveling.</p><p>This new Gemini-backed screenshot feature in Maps is rolling out "this week" in the U.S. for iOS users first. Google says Android support is "coming soon."</p><p>Lastly, the company highlights Google Lens' usefulness when out in the world. If you spot a landmark or cool piece of artwork, users can open the app, point at it, and submit a query about it. Google says users should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-screen-search-ios-lens-visual-search-updates">receive an AI Overview</a> packed with information about it, with links to more should you be curious.

<p>Elsewhere, Google is trying to help folks decide where they might travel this year with a glimpse into some trending destinations in 2025. When looking internationally, many trends in Google Flights lean toward the Island of Curacao, Osaka (Japan), St. Lucia (Caribbean Island), Tokyo, and more. However, domestically, folks are interested in going to San Juan, Puerto Rico the most, followed by Billings, Montana.</p><p>Hopping into Google Search shows people are looking for information on "island vacation outfits" and "wide leg linen pants."</p><p>While that Billings, Montana result might be a shock after Puerto Rico, Google says it could be because users are interested in "easy access" to the outdoors. Montana is trending alongside Juneau, Alaska, and Bangor, Maine. What's more, users are searching for "cabins" as part of a romantic getaway this year, too.</p><p>As a side note, Google's analytics show people are looking for ways to get the most space out of their bags while traveling. "Vacuum bags" and "compression packing cubes" have topped the charts recently.</p>

If you want an excellent charger or power bank for your mobile tech, be it an Android or iOS device, Windows laptop, or Chromebook even, Anker has the perfect charging gadget for you. The only complaint I've ever had with Anker's charging accessories is their price. The good news is that frequent discounts like the ongoing Amazon Big Spring Sale hack and slash the price of Anker products by delightful amounts.</p><p>One of the best new power banks by the brand is the Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 165W, Built-In and Retractable Cables). Shockingly, this 25,000mAh portable power bank is already on sale, going for a sizeable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Multi-Device-Charging-Retractable/dp/B0DCBB2YTR"><strong>20% off on Amazon</strong></a> right now.

<p>Some of the highlights of the Anker Laptop Power Bank include its dual retractable USB Type-C cables. These are the same flat InstaCords that we saw on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-car-charger-retractable-cable">Retractable Car Charger</a>, but one is more durable than the other as it's made of a flat nylon braided material. The tougher retractable cord also acts as a lanyard, which I think is proof of Anker's confidence in the cable's durability. You also get two other ports to plug in your own wires, one of which is USB-C and the other is USB-A.</p><p>Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-prime-lineup-fixes-common-power-bank-problems">Anker Prime series</a>, the Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 165W, Built-In and Retractable Cables) also has an LED screen on the front. This displays important details such as the temperature of the portable power bank, the power output/input, and the battery percentage left.</p>

<p>Since this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-high-capacity-power-banks">excellent high capacity power bank</a> has a total power rating of 165W, you can easily charge several devices at max charging speeds all at once. All three USB-C ports output 100W, so you can fast charge your laptop, Chromebook, or super fast charging phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>At 20% off, this power bank is a lot more affordable, knocking $22 off the usual going price. Since this is a trustworthy brand, you get peace of mind. But if that isn't enough for you, the 18-month warranty should lay all your other fears to rest.</p>

<ul><li>Garmin Connect Plus, a new premium plan with "personalized Active Intelligence insights," launches Thursday.</li><li>The AI assistant will summarize the meaning of your recent workout or sleep data.</li><li>Connect Plus also includes a new performance dashboard with customizable activity graphs, live workouts in the Connect mobile app, more coaching videos, expanded LiveTrack features, and exclusive badges.</li><li>The service costs $6.99/month or $69.99/year after a 30-day free trial.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Garmin has announced a new Connect Plus subscription headlined by Active Intelligence, which provides "personalized insights and suggestions throughout the day based on health and activity data." And while this news will be polarizing to long-time Garmin users, the company promises that nothing your watch does now will end up behind a paywall.</p><p>"The Garmin Connect app is a free, personalized experience, and that's not going away," a Garmin rep told us, but Connect Plus will provide "premium features" for those willing to spend $6.99/month or $69.99/year.</p><p>Garmin's screenshots show how Active Intelligence will use data like your most recent activity, last night's sleep, and scheduled workout to provide an LLM-made summary at the top of the Home view.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dayKKxVDbTqXNNUmuBwPeL" name="garmin-active-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Samsung Garmin Connect Plus screenshots showing the Active Intelligence AI summarizing users' data to recommend future activities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dayKKxVDbTqXNNUmuBwPeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Active Intelligence, not to be confused with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Strava's Athlete Intelligence</a>, is launching in beta. Garmin told me they "don't have a set timeline" for when it'll leave beta; they'll instead focus on "monitoring user feedback and performance" to see how well their AI performs in practice.</p><p>The Garmin Connect Plus AI beta seems like a more beginner-friendly, text-heavy version of training status and readiness underpinned by Firstbeat Analytics, explaining concepts newer users may not understand. But for long-time Garmin fans familiar with the jargon, Garmin is sweetening the pot with other perks.</p><p>Anyone following a Garmin Run Coach or Cycling Coach will now get access to "additional exclusive expert guidance from Garmin coaches" like "educational content and videos." So you're paying for more advice from <em>real</em> people, not just an AI.</p><p>If you regularly use LiveTrack for family members to see your progress on the trail, Connect Plus will let you make a personalized profile page with a custom URL where current and past sessions are visible, with a way to embed the LiveTrack on a website. Family and friends will also receive an automatic text when you start an activity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a23nARUPE6sajskkCUTSfL" name="garmin-connect-plus-performance-dashboard" alt="Two Garmin Connect Plus performance dashboards focused on cycling and running insights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a23nARUPE6sajskkCUTSfL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Garmin Connect already has ways to check your workout progress over time, Connect Plus has a revamped Performance Dashboard (see above) that lets you create "customizable graphs and charts over different periods of time to get a more comprehensive view of training progress" in terms of health and fitness trends.</p><p>If you like using your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> for indoor workouts, Garmin Connect Plus will let you see your watch's real-time heart rate and other data in the mobile Connect app. You'll be able to see animated previews of exercise reps for over 500 of the 1,600+ exercises that Garmin tracks on a larger screen than your watch, as well as use "workout videos" for guidance.</p><p>Finally, if you're really invested in the social side of Garmin Connect, then subscribing to Connect Plus will let you add a colorful frame to your Conect app profile pic and strive to finish exclusive challenges for extra points and badges.</p>

<p>Garmin has promised to give me access to Connect Plus starting today; I will write a follow-up on my hands-on impressions soon.</p><p>I'm not surprised by this development. Just last week, while writing about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-975-and-275-will-show-if-garmin-is-running-out-of-ideas">possible Garmin Forerunner 975 and 275 features</a>, I predicted that Garmin would emulate rival brands and offer a paid "chatbot that inputs your fitness data and explains features for beginner runners." I swear that Garmin hadn't told me about Active Intelligence when I wrote that!</p><p>As I write <em>this</em> before the announcement, I'd predict that plenty of Garmin fans will feel some type of way about Connect Plus.</p><p>Garmin likes its subscriptions — see Outdoor Plus, InReach satellite messaging and SOSs, golf or boating premium features, etc. — but a big appeal to <em>most</em> Garmin watches was that you paid a high upfront cost and then got years of use with free analytics and coaching.</p><p>Garmin has stressed that no current features will fall behind a paywall, but it's fair to question how many future features will end up as Connect Plus exclusives to make the subscription more appealing years from now. But that's just conjecture, and Garmin watches aren't suddenly deficient because of this plan.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cZbJQ7pnaQLkWeZWYjCEZX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-daily-suggested-workout" alt="A daily suggested workout for an anerobic run on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZbJQ7pnaQLkWeZWYjCEZX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin didn't have an answer when I asked if they'd give a complementary subscription to new Garmin watch buyers. Anyone who pays $1,000+ for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> can <em>afford</em> a subscription but would probably argue that they should get Connect Plus for free for a set time period — just as new Fitbit buyers get six months of Premium.</p><p>At the very least, a $6.99/month Connect Plus subscription is more affordable than most of the $10+ fitness subs out there, like Apple Fitness Plus, Fitbit Premium, or Strava Premium. But the AI novelty aside, I think Garmin's value will depend more on what kind of coaching content and workout videos it offers.</p><p>Basically, I'll need to be convinced that Connect Plus is something I need in my life, but as long as Garmin is being accurate that no current features will subtly sneak into the Connect Plus umbrella, then I'm not bothered by Garmin trying to make more money. The watches still work the same way they did yesterday.</p><p>That's why, even though some people's kneejerk reaction to Connect Plus might be outrage, I'm cautiously optimistic that Garmin's AI will make the brand's data-heavy app more accessible to casual users and curious to see whether the value lives up to the price for power users.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>POCO managed to carve out a niche in the budget and mid-range categories by delivering value-focused phones, and devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review">X7 Pro</a> exemplify this trait. If anything, POCO is doing a better job in this area than its Redmi sister brand, and this is clearly evident in the mid-range, where last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-poco-f6-pro-is-the-most-underrated-phone-of-2024">F6 Pro</a> is still a fantastic choice. <br><br>The brand is doing things a little differently in 2025; while it's still launching the F7 Pro, the focus this year is the F7 Ultra — its most powerful phone yet. The F7 Ultra is a definite statement from POCO that it can produce a phone that can hold its own against the best that OPPO, Vivo, Google, and Honor have to offer. <br><br>With the latest Qualcomm silicon, a QHD panel, 5300mAh<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025"> silicon battery</a>, and 120W charging, the F7 Ultra has a solid foundation, but its the cameras where the device truly stands out. POCO admitted in the past that cameras aren't the biggest priority for the brand, and while its phones took decent photos, they didn't measure up to their immediate rivals. <br><br>That's changing with the F7 Ultra; the phone has a 50MP main camera with a Light Fusion 800 imaging module, and it's joined by a 50MP telephoto with 2.5x optical zoom, and 32MP wide-angle lens. The best part is the price, with the phone debuting at $649, undercutting its rivals by a sizeable amount. <br><br>I used the F7 Ultra for just over two weeks, and here's why I think it is the best value-focused flagship you can buy in 2025.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-ultra-pricing-and-availability"><span>POCO F7 Ultra: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZP3zSfMxRyGzWRMXtLJvab" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra back view with POCO logo highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZP3zSfMxRyGzWRMXtLJvab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO unveiled the F7 Pro and F7 Ultra on March 27, 2025, and both devices will go on sale in select regions in Southeast Asia, the U.K., and other global markets in the coming weeks. The F7 Ultra is sold in yellow and black color variants, and POCO is selling it in two models: the base edition has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and it costs $649. There's also a 16GB/512GB model that costs $699. <br><br>To incentivize the launch, POCO is selling the 12GB/256GB F7 Ultra at $599, and the 16GB/512GB edition at $649. Considering there's just a $50 difference between the two, I'd suggest getting the 512GB model — that's the one I'm using. <br><br>The F7 Pro has the same design, same panel, same 50MP main camera, and a bigger 6000mAh battery. It misses out on the auxiliary cameras and isn't quite as fast, but otherwise, there isn't much in the way of difference between the two devices. The F7 Pro is debuting in black, silver, and blue, and the blue variant is the one to get. <br><br>It's available with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, retailing for $499. The 12GB/512GB edition costs $549, and just like the F7 Ultra, POCO is discounting either model of the F7 Pro by $50 during the launch window.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-ultra-design"><span>POCO F7 Ultra: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z37jG4ZfeMznB8exVSVrsb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra next to POCO F7 Pro against blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z37jG4ZfeMznB8exVSVrsb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Xiaomi's phones now have a semblance of design consistency between generations, that hasn't trickled down to POCO's devices. As such, the F7 Ultra has a brand-new design aesthetic that has no resemblance to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a> or F6 Pro. Thankfully, POCO is using the same design on the F7 Pro as well, so at least both models have similarities — which wasn't the case last year on the standard POCO F6.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wEJePx2d6HPHueRBEoTWcb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra side view with power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wEJePx2d6HPHueRBEoTWcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The F7 Ultra has flat sides, but the beveled edges make it comfortable to hold and use the device, and the back curves slightly where it meets the mid-frame. There's a new design for the camera housing at the back, and it doesn't quite stand out as much; it's just a circular design that houses the three imaging modules, with the flash sitting on the right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J23ZHvxUUGscG7hVcB9Znb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra next to F7 Pro back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J23ZHvxUUGscG7hVcB9Znb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a steel ring encircling the camera island, and a yellow accent around the housing that gives it a little flair, but overall, it doesn't have the same bold characteristics that defined POCO's previous phones in this series. Talking about bold, the yellow color definitely stands out, and the matte texture at the back has a great in-hand feel, and doesn't pick up any smudges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LyJorK9DqSwb8axGDhLCdb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra side view highlighting matte texture" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyJorK9DqSwb8axGDhLCdb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the yellow color scheme in general — it makes the device that much more distinctive — and while the back looks great, the sides are rather plain, and I think POCO should have color-matched the sides to deliver a more cohesive design. POCO did that with the F7 Pro, which has a silver back and sides, so I'm not really sure why it didn't on the Ultra variant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aBrPAD22e9UaTLzLHgtqab" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra bottom view highlighting audio and USB-C connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aBrPAD22e9UaTLzLHgtqab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, POCO did the right thing by using matte sides, and it makes holding the phone a little easier. The mid-frame is aluminum, and coming in at 212g, the phone has a nice heft to it. There's good weight distribution as well, and it never once felt unwieldy. The rest of the features are standard; you get a dual-SIM tray, power and volume buttons on the right, and stereo sound.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uVdZ9wsERzwzTvxezuYifb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra back view on blue background with yellow colors next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uVdZ9wsERzwzTvxezuYifb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, POCO is using an ultrasonic module on the F7 Ultra, and it is located at just the right position. The module is fast and doesn't have any issues, and it holds up just as well with wet or oily fingers. Rounding out the design, the F7 Ultra gets IP68 dust and water resistance, and it can be easily submerged in up to 2.5 meters of water — higher than the 1.5-meter restriction that's on most phones. <br><br>The F7 Ultra isn't quite as flamboyant as a few POCO phones I used in the past, but it has a good in-hand feel, and it's clearly built to last, and that's what ultimately matters.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-ultra-display"><span>POCO F7 Ultra: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QsUzJ2sV38B5mepQuHZd2c" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra home page against blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QsUzJ2sV38B5mepQuHZd2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO has used 6.67-inch displays for a while now, and that isn't changing with the F7 Ultra; the phone has the same size and 3200 x 1440 resolution. There's Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and the panel is noticeably brighter this time — I didn't see any issues using it outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CP442avfDKZGQr3u4nwppb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra camera underneath the OLED panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CP442avfDKZGQr3u4nwppb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Colors are vibrant out of the box, and POCO knows how to calibrate these panels at the factory. That has always been a plus point on the brand's devices, and that hasn't changed. You get good customizability with the colors as well; the Original colour Pro is set out of the box, and the device has Vivid and Saturated modes alongside color-accurate P3 and Adobe sRGB. Of course, you can also adjust the color balance according to your tastes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="enMviRUfwsPCjKD9Bbagzb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra running a YouTube video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/enMviRUfwsPCjKD9Bbagzb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is set to FHD+ and auto refresh out of the box, so you will need to dive into the settings to change these two to QHD+ and 120Hz to make the most out of the device. A new feature that's debuting this time is circular polarization technology, which delivers a more natural light. It is similar to what Honor did on the Magic 7 Pro, and it is noticeable when using the device next to the F6 Pro. <br><br>The F7 Ultra also gets 3840Hz PWM dimming, and this is a welcome move. Xiaomi and other Chinese brands are doing all the right things when it comes to eye care on their devices, and it's good to see the F7 Ultra get the full suite of features. Xiaomi's always-on styles aren't quite as extensive as what you get with ColorOS or Funtouch OS, but you get a decent selection, and you can choose to have the mode enabled throughout the day or set up a custom schedule.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zsYgjDkxRVNDQAF4Ve3kwb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra icons on the home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zsYgjDkxRVNDQAF4Ve3kwb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the F7 Ultra gets a dedicated VisionBoost D7 chip that optimizes video playback and delivers smoother visuals while gaming, with POCO positioning 120fps gaming as a clear differentiator. On that subject, gaming is a delight on the device, with the phone able to handle demanding titles without any hassle whatsoever.</p>
<p>It holds up just as well with multimedia content; HDR rendering is handled well, and there's a noticeable difference to last year when it comes to brightness levels and color fidelity. POCO is using a custom Shield Glass solution — similar to what Xiaomi does on its own devices — and in my use, the phone didn't have any issues even after several tumbles.</p>

<p>I've always enjoyed using POCO's devices because of the powerful hardware, and the F7 Ultra is in a league of its own. Thanks to the latest Qualcomm silicon, the phone holds its own against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">Zenfone 12 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>. Similar to those devices, I didn't see any issues with the F7 Ultra in regular use; the phone handled mundane tasks without breaking a sweat, and even visually-intensive titles didn't tax the hardware to any noticeable degree. <br><br>The hardware tends to run hotter — this is the case with all Qualcomm-powered phones this year — and there is overheating during extended gaming sessions. That said, it doesn't get so hot as to become uncomfortable to hold. It's clear that Qualcomm increased power limits this year, and that is evident when using the phone next to previous iterations. The plus side is that you get better gaming performance, with rock-solid framerates.</p>

<p>POCO is using the Surge T1S chip to deliver better connectivity, and although I didn't see any difference when using the F7 Ultra on my home network, it had a stronger signal over cellular data. The phone has Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0 — just like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra — NFC, AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless, and LHDC codecs. In short, you don't miss out on anything on the connectivity side of things. <br><br>The vibration motor is quite good too, and while it isn't as detailed as the one on the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, it has good feedback when using the keyboard — certainly much better than previous POCO phones.</p>

<p>There is a lot to like with the battery as well. The 5300mAh battery easily manages to last a day with relative ease, and even with heavy use, I didn't have to worry about battery running out before the end of the day. POCO is also using silicon battery tech this time, and it allows the brand to deliver a bigger battery in a smaller size — always a good thing. <br><br>The phone gets 120W charging, and it takes 38 minutes to charge the battery. You'll need to enable the Boost charging mode to unlock 120W charging, with the phone using 90W in regular use. Overall, this is the best hardware package in the sub-$800 category, and like previous years, POCO absolutely dominates the value.</p>

<p>POCO was always upfront about the cameras on its phones; while its devices did a decent enough job, imaging just wasn't a priority for the brand. That's thankfully changing with the F7 Ultra; the phone has the same 50MP Light Fusion camera as last year, and it's using the same OmniVision OVX8000 module with OIS. What's different is the auxiliary lenses; there's now a 50MP Samsung JN5 tele lens with 2.5x optical zoom and OIS, and a 32MP wide-angle lens. <br><br>Just with the addition of the auxiliary lenses, the F7 Ultra has the best camera package of any POCO device by a considerable margin. Video shooting is much better too; you get 8K24 in addition to 4K60, and video quality is leagues better than earlier POCO phones. The camera interface hasn't changed much, so if you've used a Xiaomi or POCO phone in the past, you'll know your way around the viewfinder.</p>

<p>Daylight photos taken with the F7 Ultra have good detail and color rendition, and there are absolutely no issues in this regard. While it is using the same module as last year, changes to the tuning mean you get much better shots, and this is evident in low-light and challenging scenarios. In short, the phone doesn't have any shortcomings when it comes to the main camera, and it does a brilliant job in this regard. <br><br>While the auxiliary lenses aren't as good, they're much better than any other POCO phone I used until now. The phone delivers clean photos at 2.5x and usable shots up to 5x, and wide-angle shots have good colors. The wide-angle lens has its drawbacks in low-light situations, but on the whole, this is a vastly better showing than previous years. <br><br>Ultimately, the F7 Ultra doesn't quite measure up to the OnePlus 13, Find X8, Vivo X200, and Xiaomi 15, but the cameras don't feel like a limitation any longer — that in itself is a huge deal.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-ultra-software"><span>POCO F7 Ultra: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5rYn3au5Ama8uuRZ8s8izb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra Android 15 Easter egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rYn3au5Ama8uuRZ8s8izb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn't much to talk about on the software front; the device features HyperOS 2.0.4.0 out of the box, and it uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> as the foundation. As I used the Xiaomi 15 Ultra before switching over, the software is pretty much identical; POCO does a few things differently when it comes to icons, but other than that, it is the same software as every other Xiaomi phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mPmgyidbGwModmtNeRK5mb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="POCO F7 Ultra notification pane with YouTube Music and Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPmgyidbGwModmtNeRK5mb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the interface itself hasn't changed too much over the last two years, it has better fluidity, and that is immediately noticeable when using the F7 Ultra against older POCO phones. I still don't like the split notification pane, but I'm used to it by now, and it is easily customizable. The software itself has plenty of customizability in general, and that's thankfully something that hasn't changed on POCO's phones. <br><br>There is still some bloatware, but nowhere as much as years past, and it can be easily uninstalled. POCO says it will deliver four Android OS updates alongside six years of security updates to the F7 Ultra and F7 Pro, and that is good to see. While it isn't quite as much as what Google, Samsung, and Honor deliver, it is still a decent move. That said, the device isn't likely to get Android 16 well after its release; POCO takes its time to roll out software updates, and it needs to change that.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-ultra-the-alternatives"><span>POCO F7 Ultra: The alternatives</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DzBHCZjFH26FiDRuAuxRwb" name="POCO F7 Ultra" alt="Back view of POCO F7 Ultra next to F7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DzBHCZjFH26FiDRuAuxRwb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best alternative to the F7 Ultra is the F7 Pro; the phone has the same design, same panel, same main camera at the back, and same software. The auxiliary cameras aren't anywhere as good, and while it isn't quite as fast, you don't notice any difference even while gaming. As a bonus, the F7 Pro has a bigger 6000mAh battery, and even though it gets 90W charging instead of 120W, you're not actually missing out much. All things considered, the F7 Pro is a fabulous value at $499. <br><br>I like the OnePlus 13 a lot; it has one of the best camera packages in this category, and the design is stunning. Coming in at $899, it is $250 costlier than the F7 Ultra, and I'd suggest getting it if you need better cameras; otherwise, the F7 Ultra is a better choice in most areas.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>POCO F7 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h2>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a phone with the latest hardware</li><li>You want decent cameras at the back</li><li>You need a high-end phone with the best value</li><li>You need reliable battery life</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need timely software updates</li><li>You want the best cameras</li></ul>
<p>POCO did it once again — the F7 Ultra is proof that you don't need to shell out a ridiculous amount of money to get a great phone. The phone loses some of the flamboyance that characterized POCO devices in the past, but that's ultimately a good thing; it looks much more like a mainstream phone now. <br><br>The hardware is a clear differentiator; this is the most affordable way to get your hands on the latest Qualcomm silicon, and that in itself is highly alluring. Combine that with a high-quality OLED panel and all-day battery life with 120W charging, and the F7 Ultra nails the basics. <br><br>It also has the best cameras of any POCO phone yet. I know that doesn't mean much as the brand didn't prioritize imaging in the past, but it definitely makes a difference, and it gives the F7 Ultra a sizeable lead over its predecessors. POCO still has a way to go before it can measure up to OPPO, Vivo, Honor, and OnePlus, but this is a big step in the right direction. <br><br>Ultimately, there isn't much to criticize with the device. POCO did all the right things with the hardware and cameras, and while the software isn't quite as good, there's no denying that the F7 Ultra is a definite bargain. If you need the best value while still getting flagship internals, the F7 Ultra is the phone to buy in 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge shows up in another leak in a supposed Titanium finish.</li><li>The Titanium variant will allegedly come in three colorways: Jet Black, Icyblue, and Silver.</li><li>While we don't have official confirmation yet, but the phone is expect to launch on April 16 this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has been the center of several leaks recently, considering it's inching closer to launch— that is expected to happen on April 16 according to previous chatter. Samsung also showcased the phone more vividly at the MWC this year, multiple devices only in the silver colorway were suspended by a mental wire.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/the-galaxy-s25-edge-might-surprise-with-higher-prices-for-certain-models" target="_blank">We</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/the-galaxy-s25-edge-might-surprise-with-higher-prices-for-certain-models"> were aware</a> that the phone could come in a Titanium build according to previous leaks, showcasing the "Titanium Jet Black," "Titanium Silver," and "Titanium Icy Blue," similar to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. This is the first time we got to see how they would look in the above-mentioned colorways, thanks to official-looking renders from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,149881.html">WinFuture.</a></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GqsKf64SdjS5S3RWb4DWAD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-Colorways" alt="Titanium colorways of Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqsKf64SdjS5S3RWb4DWAD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WinFuture)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Previous rumors indicated that the phone would have all ceramic on its back panel with an Armor Aluminum frame to make sure it weathers the wear and tear of daily usage, considering it is said to be 5.84mm thin. But now, with these new renders from WinFuture, it seems like the company has taken the Titanium route to make sure they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-wants-to-avoid-a-bendgate-disaster-with-a-durable-galaxy-s25-edge" target="_blank">avoid a bend gate disaster</a>, although the exact materials used are still unconfirmed.</p><p>Since the time this phone was dropped at the end of this year's Unpacked Event in January, we've been privy to almost all of its specs in the recent past. To start, the phone is said to have a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>. However, the device is said to come with a smaller 3900mAh battery compared to the rest of the Galaxy S25 series (with some rumors pointing to a 4,000mAh unit).</p><p>We currently have no information about the device's charging speeds or its compatibility with Qi2 chargers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5PeWRDanM36qRK29WFqjoB" name="Screenshot- Samsung-galaxy-S25-Edge" alt="Screenshot of the new Samsung Galaxy Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5PeWRDanM36qRK29WFqjoB.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, the device will feature two rear cameras: reportedly a primary 200MP lens and a 12MP lens for ultrawide shots, along with a selfie camera, which we don't have much information about. The device is said to come with two storage options: 256GB and 512GB, which will both have 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Titanium build phones are usually on the higher end of the cost spectrum, and considering the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge could be one of them, we heard chatter that the 256GB model could cost €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400), while the 512GB version might hit €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520), respectively.</p><p>Recently, YouTuber <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I6XJPnji3o" target="_blank">Alexis Garza</a> was lucky enough to take this phone for a spin and put it through<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finalwire.aida64&hl=en" target="_blank"> the AIDA64 app</a>, which provides hardware and software information as well as diagnostic information for Android devices. While confirming the above-mentioned specs, Garza stated that the phone will also support Bluetooth 5.4</p><p>As much as these leaks look like the real deal, they should still be taken with a grain of salt, as some of these features might not show up on the actual device.</p>

<ul><li>Google's latest Workspace feature drop is here, and the March 2025 edition includes a handful of Gemini features.</li><li>The Gemini sidebar in Workspace apps now supports more languages, and Google Chat works with over 120 languages for inline translation.</li><li>Gemini's meeting notes for Google Meet now add action items and optional meeting transcripts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Once scattered throughout the month, Google is now bundling new Workspace features into monthly feature drops. The March 2025 Workspace feature drop is here, packing one feature previously announced and a few brand new ones.</p><p>The updates were revealed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/march-workspace-feature-drop?e=48754805" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, March 26, and include new language support in Workspace apps, expanded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> meeting notes, and inline Google Chat translation.</p>
<h2 id="upgraded-language-support-in-workspace-inline-google-chat-translation-2">Upgraded language support in Workspace, inline Google Chat translation</h2>
<p>This month's feature drop includes more support for languages in Workspace apps, specifically in Gemini integrations. For instance, Gemini's "Translate for me" feature now supports over 120 languages in Google Chat. The service can automatically detect and translate inline text, allowing users to view the original text or translated text with a single click.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.98%;"><img id="oYwKckApkLS4yHfBKocgRK" name="Translate-For-Me-Google-Chat" alt="Inline translation with Gemini in Google Chat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oYwKckApkLS4yHfBKocgRK.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1383" height="871" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Previously, users would've had to use Google Translate to translate foreign languages separately. This could save Google Chat users time, as they can quickly view translations for the vast number of supported languages directly in their conversation.</p><p>Additionally, the Gemini side panel in most Workspace apps now supports more languages. Gmail, Docs, Slides, and Sheets will work with a total of 29 supported languages, with the full list below:</p>
<ul><li>Arabic</li><li>Catalan</li><li>Chinese</li><li>Czech</li><li>Danish</li><li>Dutch</li><li>English</li><li>Finnish</li><li>French</li><li>German</li><li>Greek</li><li>Hebrew</li><li>Hungarian</li><li>Indonesian</li><li>Italian</li><li>Japanese</li><li>Korean</li><li>Malay</li><li>Norwegian</li><li>Polish</li><li>Portuguese</li><li>Romanian</li><li>Russian</li><li>Spanish</li><li>Swedish</li><li>Thai</li><li>Turkish</li><li>Ukrainian</li><li>Vietnamese</li></ul>
<p>Google Chat's Gemini side panel is a bit more limited, with only eight languages currently supported. You can view the full list of supported languages for each Gemini in Workspace feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/14925782" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-s-meeting-notes-now-identify-action-items-2">Gemini's meeting notes now identify action items</h2>
<p>Separately, Google is adding a final section to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-gemini-note-taking-feature">meeting notes generated by "Take notes for me" with Gemini</a> in Google Meet. Currently, using the Take notes for me feature will generate a Google Doc that recaps a virtual meeting without participants or hosts lifting a finger. It includes quick links to meeting attendees, recordings, and transcripts, as well as a basic summary with important details listed separately.</p><p>Now, the company is adding a new dimension to Gemini's meeting notes with "Suggested next steps." At the end of the document created with Take notes for me, you'll see a Suggested next steps section with important action items.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.99%;"><img id="3q6arVi3HtzzahYeMZSHMA" name="Google-Meet-Gemini-Notes" alt="Next steps in Google Meet "take notes for me."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3q6arVi3HtzzahYeMZSHMA.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="1075" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google says these can be edited or assigned to specific team members. If selected, the list of meeting notes can include the full transcript and will be sent to participants via Gmail. Last month, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-gets-scrollable-captions-to-help-you-stay-in-the-loop-during-calls">added support for scrollable captions</a> to make catching up on a live transcript easier.</p>
<h2 id="plus-google-vids-can-create-voiceovers-with-ai-2">Plus, Google Vids can create voiceovers with AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1810px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.67%;"><img id="ZMZrFa8qNuKwwP6eM7Td6T" name="Adding new capabilities to Google Vids’ ‘Help me create’" alt="Generating a VoiceOver with Google Vids." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMZrFa8qNuKwwP6eM7Td6T.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1810" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vids-can-now-generate-ai-voiceovers-for-your-videos">As announced last week</a>, Google Vids is also getting an upgrade to its "Help me create" tool. This previously allowed users to generate a video and a voiceover script with AI.  The latest Vids feature can take that AI-generated script and turn it into a real voiceover, saving recording time.</p>
<p>Some of the features included in the March 2025 Google Workspace feature drop may require a paid Workspace account, either via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a> or a work or school plan. It can take weeks or longer for the features to roll out for everyone, depending on their release schedule.</p>

<p>Heading into 2025, things were looking pretty bleak for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">Android emulation</a> scene. Nintendo took down multiple Switch emulators, and there just wasn't much progress being made for other platforms. Fast forward to today, and while things are looking slightly better on the Switch front, it's also now possible to play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3</a> AND Windows games right on your phone.</p><p>Of course, after you get everything set up, using the on-screen controls isn't exactly ideal. This is just one of the reasons why I always recommend picking up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">game controller</a> that you can use to create a Switch-like mobile gaming experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-5" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom via Sudachi with the GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there's definitely no shortage of options to choose from, the GameSir G8 Plus is always the first controller I recommend. For one, it works with practically every device that I have, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> with its enormous 14.6-inch display.</p><p>Of course, not everyone is going to use a tablet of that size to play games, but it does speak to the versatility offered by the G8 Plus. Speaking of which, one of the big reasons why I prefer the G8 Plus over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">G8 Galileo</a> (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G8-Galileo-Controller-Joysticks/dp/B0CM3C9HRG/">which is also on sale</a>) is that I don't have to worry about the USB-C port getting in the way. This way, I can slot in my phone, start playing, and then stop playing just as quickly.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> is gaining a few new features on Android that make customizing your personalized radio stations and playlist cover art easier. "Ask Music," a feature that lets users create custom stations based on their mood using simple prompts, can now be further refined after the first try. It's rolling out this week for YouTube Premium subscribers in supported regions.</p><p>The process for creating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-is-testing-letting-you-build-custom-radio-stations-using-ai-prompts">Ask Music</a> starts with a prompt that describes their mood, like the examples YouTube provides of "upbeat workout tracks" or "relaxing jazz." From there, you'll get a custom radio station that helps with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">discovery of the streaming service's 100-million-track catalog</a>.</p><p>What's new with YouTube Music's latest update is the ability to further refine Ask Music radio stations after the initial prompt. Users can tweak their personalized radio stations by either typing or speaking additional prompts. The app will show chips with suggestion prompts to help YouTube Music users come up with ideas, such as "more upbeat," "just jazz songs" or "only female vocals."</p>

<p>Right now, YouTube says that Ask Music is only available for YouTube Music Premium subscribers in the following supported regions: U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. It'll work on both the Android and iOS mobile apps, too.</p><p>YouTube Premium subscribers in the U.S. will get one more exclusive feature, and that's AI-generated titles for My Mix playlist. Based on the songs included in the My Mix playlist, YouTube Music's AI will come up with a title that represents the mood and feel of the playlist.</p><p>Finally, YouTube Music is adding new support for custom cover art for playlists. There are two new AI-generated cover art themes — "Workout" and "Instruments" — that can be used to create unique artwork. Additionally, custom playlist thumbnails, which were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-custom-playlist-thumbnails">first available on the web</a>, are now supported on the Android app. They'll be launching on iOS in the coming months, per the company.</p><p>These updates are rolling out this week on the YouTube Music app for Android.</p>

This watch normally retails for $349.99 for the 41mm Wi-Fi model, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9138ZXM/">this deal shaves $60 off</a>, meaning you can strap the watch for less than $300. It's not the lowest price we've seen the Pixel Watch 3, which dipped to $279 during Black Friday, but I can manage the $10 difference. Wear OS is largely devoid of good cheap smartwatches, so any discount is always worth looking at.</p>

<p>So why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>? Aside from it being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, my mother has been asking for new watch bands for her Fitbit, and being the loving son that I am, I would much rather upgrade her device instead. She has some fitness goals she's working toward, and a new smartwatch that integrates Fitbit and has access to her favorite music streaming services feels like a win.</p><p>Plus, she and I can have matching smartwatches. I've been using the Pixel Watch 3 since it launched in October, and I love this smartwatch. It's fluid, designed extremely well, and has a surprisingly impressive battery life. I also find the AI-generated workouts to be quite useful and a good motivation.</p>

While not as good as the Pixel Watch 3, this model was an improvement over the original, with better battery life and accurate heart rate monitoring.

<p>While I can't always get my mom the latest tech gadgets, she always appreciates when I can, and she always trusts my judgment. That's why I want to get her a couple of additional trinkets that I noticed are on sale for the Amazon Big Spring Sale.</p><p>She really enjoys listening to music whenever she's out and about, but she has bad luck choosing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> that work well or fit her ears comfortably. That's why the Soundcore Sport X20 caught my eye, as they feature the ear hook design that she prefers.</p><p>They also have long battery life, IP68 water and dust resistance, and ANC, which is honestly pretty sweet for earbuds that you can get for just $64.</p>

<p>I'm also going to grab her the Anker Nano Power Bank. This is something I always like to point out whenever it's on sale because of how much I love this product. I carry it around with me all the time, and the built-in cord with the loop design comes in clutch!</p><p>With the 10,000mAh capacity, she'll have enough juice to power up her phone, new earbuds, and even my little brother's phone if he's been playing too many games on it. And the little display will always let her know how much power it has left or how long it will take to charge up a device.</p>

<hr>
<p>A surge of reports all contain users voicing issues with Google's recent Pixel flagships and alarms.</p><p>Many Google Pixel users took to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jir4tz/all_of_my_alarms_turned_themselves_off_over_the/">respective subreddit</a> to begin reporting issues with their previously set alarms not going off as intended (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/26/google-pixel-failed-alarm-clock-reports/">9to5Google</a>). Posted two days ago, one user states their alarms on their Pixel never went off. In fact, they had set four alarms, and all four were "turned off," not dismissed. The user did some testing and stated they turned their alarms off and on, which seemingly worked the following day.</p><p>However, each alarm soon deactivated itself after that on the following day.</p><p>Users are scrambling to figure out what the issue is as others in the thread note a similar problem. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jir4tz/comment/mjha9mf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user states</a> they wonder if it has anything to do with a Gemini notification. Their post reads, "My initial assumption was that I told Gemini to stop a timer that was going off and it canceled all my alarms."</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jg2nz3/my_alarm_did_not_go_off_today/?rdt=57617">separate thread</a> gives a little more clarity on the affected devices, as the original poster states their alarms didn't go off on a Pixel 9. The user states the alarm that was deactivated was for work throughout the week and had been "working for years until now." Several more users with a Pixel 9 series device report the same issue.</p><p>Curiously, other users state they've encountered these issues <em>after </em>downloading the latest March 2025 feature drop.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jg2nz3/my_alarm_did_not_go_off_today">My alarm did not go off today.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>This is a truly strange problem going around. As always, even if you haven't experienced issues, please check your Pixel phone's alarms before you go to bed. Moreover, Google hasn't made a statement about this issue, but these user reports may get its attention and will (hopefully) lead to a future fix.</p><p>Users highlighting these alarm issues after the March feature drop makes sense <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">when you consider the struggles</a> some have been going through. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">update arrived</a> on March 4, but shortly after, users started reporting annoying brightness problems, audio issues, and inconsistent vibrations. The problem affected users with devices ranging from the Pixel 7 to the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>There were some band-aid fixes mentioned for the brightness and vibration issues, though. Similar to what we've seen reported with the Pixel alarms, another patch is expected to help give these users some relief.</p><p>Google's latest feature drop was packed with new features like scam detection in the Messages and Phone apps. The company also expanded its Satellite SOS support to more regions like Canada and Europe. Additionally, the Pixel Watch 3 gained Loss of Pulse and menstrual cycle tracking.</p>

<p>Amid a little One UI 7 rollout confusion, Samsung is now bringing clarity to the specifics behind its next OS debut.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1904787401488080960">Tarun Vats on X</a>, the company has posted a detailed schedule of its One UI 7 rollout for several past-gen Galaxy devices (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/26/samsung-one-ui-7-schedule-dates/">9to5Google</a>). Samsung's Czech Republic website has posted the dates for which devices should begin expecting the major OS upgrade. The post states April 10 will mark the beginning of One UI 7's arrival on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Flip 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a> in the region.</p><p>Officially, the Czech Republic's post states "a week later" (potentially April 17), the Galaxy S24 FE, S23 series, Flip 5, and Fold 5 will receive the update. This will then be followed by One UI 7's arrival on the S23 FE and the S22 "in the coming weeks," which is speculated to be late April.</p><p>Samsung's post lists its eligible Galaxy tablets separately, beginning with the Galaxy Tab S10 series, which should see One UI 7 in mid-April. Lastly, the Tab S9 and S8 series will grab it in late April.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Czech Republic: One UI 7 Rollout Schedule 📅 April 10 – Galaxy S24, Z Flip6 & Z Fold6 📅 Week Later– Galaxy S24 FE, S23 series, Z Flip5 & Z Fold5 📅 Late April – Galaxy S23 FE, S22📱Tablets🔹 Mid-April: Galaxy Tab S10 series 🔹 Late April: Tab S9 & Tab S8 pic.twitter.com/njPZeHwmBo<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1904787401488080960">March 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>These dates could seriously matter for users in the U.S. since One UI 7's initial launch in the Czech Republic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">lines up with ours</a>. Samsung announced the U.S. will see the OS launch three days <em>after </em>its global release on April 7. However, it seems the Czech Republic has received this same date, which could mean the U.S. will see similar dates for the OS upgrade for consumers with eligible devices.</p><p>In that announcement, Samsung didn't state the reason behind the small delay for those in the U.S. The good news is the company confirmed a date for us eagerly awaiting the update after the Galaxy S24 series picked up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/the-galaxy-s24-ultras-new-one-ui-7-beta-is-crushing-bugs-before-its-april-debut">fifth One UI 7 beta</a>. The update cleaned up some glitchy lock screen notifications, small widget icons, and more.</p><p>However, Galaxy device owners should take this Czech Republic schedule with caution for the U.S. release, given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-us-deletes-april-10-one-ui-7-announcement-post">the strange confusion</a> with its blog post. The U.S. One UI 7 announcement post disappeared over the weekend before reappearing a day later. While speculation leans toward there having been a slight glitch on the website, others have noted Samsung's U.S. X account links to a "page not found" site.</p><p>We'll likely have to play things by ear (and eye) as we approach the extremely hopeful April 10 release date.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is due to release its next set of foldables sometime later this year at a summer Unpacked event, according to several rumors. While we don't have confirmation of the launch yet, several leaks seem to be dropping like hotcakes.</p><p>This time, the leak showcased alleged cases for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Firstly, in a post on Weibo, avid tipster IceUniverse posted several images of the alleged Galaxy Z Flip 7 (via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/samsung-phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-design-just-teased-in-new-cases-leak-and-the-outer-display-is-huge" target="_blank"> Tom's Guide</a>). These images show the device sporting different-colored cases from all angles.</p>

<p>The images show off the renders of the phone, cased in eight different colors, but what's more interesting is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-shows-up-in-another-leak-with-starkly-familiar-camera-design">images back previous rumors </a>of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 — that it might indeed see a redesign and come with a larger 4-inch cover display.</p><p>It also appears to ditch the "folder-like" cover display of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>'s 3.6-inch display for a more end-to-end, seamless one — much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a>. The renders also show us the rear cameras on the cover display that is expected to be a 50MP primary lens and a 12MP ultra-wide lens.</p><p>Additionally, IceUniverse posted four additional pictures on X that showcased real-life protective films and cases of the upcoming foldables. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 cases both black and clear seem to support the larger cover display it is said to come with, additionally, you see bumps for volume controls and the power button.</p>

<p>As for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">leaks indicate</a> that it could come with larger inner and outer displays, with a 6.5-inch cover screen and an 8.2-inch main screen. Samsung also gave us a major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">hint at this year's MWC</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7"> </a>where it demoed a "nameless" foldable placed next to the Galaxy Z Fold 6.  This prototype showcased a display with nearly no fold crease whatsoever.</p><p>The images of cases from IceUniverse also seem to back the rumor of a large screen for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and the case also looks slightly narrower according to the publication.</p><p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt, as we're still quite a few months from the potential launch of Samsung's next foldable phones.</p>

Having said that, the real issues don't stem from the software itself or the phones that will eventually receive the update; it's a matter of over-promising and under-delivering. Unfortunately, that's pretty common when the people doing the selling aren't the people doing the building.</p><p>There are three different camps here. I know this because I have spent the last three days reading whatever people had to say about it. I do not recommend it if you don't love the aftertaste of Tylenol.</p><p>One group of people is sharpening pitchforks while posting on websites like Reddit about how Samsung is terrible, and they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1iq53vc/for_the_people_who_are_leaving_samsung_because_of/" target="_blank">never buying another Samsung phone</a> again. Others are coping and making excuses for the whole mess while posting responses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1iw7go6/samsung_blames_google_for_delay_in_one_ui_70/" target="_blank">from Samsung Customer Care, blaming Google</a> for the rollout issues.</p><p>The third group? They don't care as long as things still work right now and won't break when they're told to update their software. I think everyone is right and everyone is wrong, all at the same time.</p>

It will get here eventually — the latest says it's coming in April — but that doesn't address the real problem: writing software is hard, and unless you have done it, you have no idea how hard it can be.</p><p>Of course, seeing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> released with the update makes it especially hard for consumers to swallow.</p><p>I'm saying the real problems with the rollout of One UI 7 are all about communication, transparency, and setting expectations. It has nothing to do with features or options or anything technical.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-welcome" alt="One UI 7 welcome screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sitting in front of colorful plants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You may think using software another company makes for you, like Android (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">from Google</a>) or Windows (from Microsoft), is easy, but it's not. It could be if every company used the exact same configuration of hardware specifically designated by the company that wrote it, but then you'd have a more Apple-like situation where you can't choose what product fits you best. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not for everyone.</p><p>Android is especially difficult because it's so ... "loose." However, as long as you follow some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it" target="_blank">rules from Google</a>, you can do a lot with it to make it look and act like something completely different — enter One UI 7.</p><p>Samsung executives and project managers have a vision of what each version of One UI will be. They decide how it will look, what features will be improved, which new features are needed, and what features will be removed. They base this on the feedback you give while using your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> via data collection. The next version of One UI will be a mix of things that Samsung knows users like to interact with.</p><p>This isn't done in a vacuum. Managers, engineers, marketing, and even carrier representatives are involved in the decisions that go into the update and its release schedule. One side wants everything, and they want it now, while others are more timid and want more time. A compromise is reached, and a timeline is built. Then, the chaos and "crunch time" begin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yGgesVgwjpdeBv98iQNoHm" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-Samsung-Google-partnership.jpeg" alt="Samsung and Google execs stand on stage together at Galaxy Unpacked." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGgesVgwjpdeBv98iQNoHm.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The folks tasked with developing the ideas given to them from people up the chain need to find a way to do it all and try to do it by a given date. Samsung has historically been terrible at this, and I can't blame anyone at the company for it. Neither should you. It's a communication breakdown between the people making the promises and the people trying to fulfill them.</p><p>When you want to try and do too much, you need too much time. Integrating a new (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">though now a year old</a>) version of Android with a slew of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">AI parlor tricks</a> and a reinvented notification idea that will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-third-party-app-now-bar-support-report">include sports scores</a> and the kitchen sink is too much.</p><p>To top it all off, much of it will be discarded once a better way is introduced that's more integrated with Android. Split windows and one-handed mode come to mind. Samsung wants to be first, so it will race forward with an idea instead of waiting because that's a good way to sell more phones. If you are reading this on a Galaxy S phone, it probably worked on you.</p><p>None of this is a bad idea or anything you should be upset about. If you're upset, it's because you were told one thing and delivered a different thing. The overworked developers doing it aren't the people who told you what you would get and when you would get it. Welcome to marketing.</p>

<p>It will be here when it gets here. That's it; there is nothing more we need to know about it.</p><p>We <em><strong>want</strong></em> to know a lot more, though. We want to know a date and what to expect. We want to know that it won't have issues or be filled with bugs. We want it all, and we want it now. This goes for software updates from every company, not just Samsung.</p><p>I hate to break it to you, but it didn't get here when you wanted it, and once it does, there will be bugs. You may get angry and complain on the internet, and I can't blame you. Please complain about it the right way — Samsung needs to be more transparent and develop better communication with its customers before it tries to do anything else. The company has made great strides in software development over the past 10 years, and it's time to work on other things.</p>

<ul><li>Google reportedly "confirmed" to a publication that it will move to "privately" develop its Android OS and slow down its AOSP releases.</li><li>The main purpose of this is to "streamline" its process, as Google won't have to worry about "merging conflicts" with the AOSP as often.</li><li>Google is still expected to release its open source code on the AOSP as usual, but with a small change to its cadence.</li><li>Android 16 recently achieved Platform Stability ahead of its expected Q2 2025 launch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A curious report on the future development plans of Android from Google has surfaced, detailing its potential impact.</p><p>A report by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">Android Authority</a>) supposedly "confirms" Google will shift to privately developing the Android OS as soon as "next week." The claim that Google's audible to a "private" focus only seems to facilitate a more "streamlined" approach to its OS development. According to Rahman, this more privatized way of developing Android will have a "minimal" impact for end-users who await these updates once completed.</p><p>Additionally, developers, both those who create custom ROMs and others who contribute to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">AOSP</a>, will also see little impact.</p><p>Rahman claims this change will more directly impact Google and the AOSP (Android Open-Source Project). The company will allegedly "change the frequency of public source code releases for specific Android components." Rahman states that, with Google's normal public source code releases for the AOSP, the company needs to "spend time and effort merging patches."</p><p>The "merging" part is key as Rahman states conflict often arises between the two branches and the involved code. To avoid getting too technical, Google is required to patch these issues between its internal branch and the AOSP through its normal public source releases. Making its development more private will slow things down to help this happen less often.</p>

<p>Rahman alleges nothing will change for developers looking forward to Android 16 as its open source code will see an expected release when it's ready. This makes sense as the entire purpose of the AOSP is for other developers to create their Android OS skins, like One UI from Samsung. However, since Google may take Android's software behind closed doors for longer (and more often), tipsters/leakers could find it harder to see what's coming.</p><p>Nothing has been directly confirmed yet from Google. The report alleges the company will make an official statement about this development change "later this week," so we'll see what happens.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">achieved an important milestone</a>: Platform Stability. Beta 3 rolled out for enrolled Pixels, bringing with it additional accessibility tools for low-vision users via Text Outline. The patch also includes "Local Network Protection," which lets users control what apps can access their device. Platform Stability is the last step before Android 16's grand rollout for users.</p><p>This step should consume the rest of March and April before the software drops in Q2 2025.</p>

<p>For years, Samsung has crafted some of the finest displays ever made by humankind. Ching Wan Tang and Steven Van Slyke might have created OLED technology at Eastman Kodak back in 1987, but it was Samsung who popularized its use in mobile devices with the launch of the original Samsung Galaxy line in 2010.</p><p>Over the years, however, Samsung has been slipping. Of course, you'd never know this by looking at smartphone display rankings on websites <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dxomark.com/smartphones/#sort-display">like DXOMark</a>, where 9 out of the top 10 smartphone displays are all made by Samsung. Look a little deeper, though, and you'll start to understand the real problem: these displays are built to rank at the top of charts by using some nasty tricks that cause users <strong>real pain</strong>.</p><p>It's a similar "cheating" concept we saw years ago when smartphone manufacturers would specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-cheat-android-benchmarks">tweak their phones' performance profiles</a> to push harder during a benchmark to achieve a top-rank score. The difference now is that it's not a company's pride on the line; it's our eyes.</p>

<p>HDR standards have been around for a long time and are commonplace on spec sheets. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">Even $200 phones</a> support the HDR10 standard, but not all of them achieve 10-bit color naturally. Rather, many phone displays — including the $1,300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> — only ship with a screen that can display 8-bit color.</p><p>As you might imagine, a pixel can't just magically jump from being able to display 256 shades of red, green, or blue up to 1024 shades unless it was built to do so. That's four times the number of each of the primary shades, which takes a significant engineering effort to create.</p><p>So, how does an 8-bit phone display achieve 10-bit color? By using something known as dithering, or more often known on displays as Frame Rate Control (FRC). You'll often see this on a spec sheet as "8bit + FRC" to represent the shift from 16.7 million colors — that's the total number of colors in an 8-bit palette — all the way up to 1.07 <strong>billion</strong> colors for 10-bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="ChK2zpLgKyiqsp5DsAVNfU" name="pixel-dithering-example" alt="An example of color dithering happening at the subpixel level on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ChK2zpLgKyiqsp5DsAVNfU.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you look closely at the above image I captured of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's display through a microscope, you can see FRC dithering in action. An 8-bit panel, like the one on this Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra pictured above, will quickly flash between two different hues to "create" a color that doesn't exist. I captured this video at 480FPS with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, which makes it possible to see the pixels flash more easily.</p><p>This phenomenon is possible thanks to the way our eyes work when they see a "moving" image. In video, pictures are often shown at 24 or 30 still images per second (frames per second), creating a smooth-looking movement. Likewise, color dithering flashes two colors to create a nonexistent color to our eyes, similar to spinning a color wheel.</p><p>For many people, this works to help create a sense of deeper or more vibrant colors. It's one of the ways Samsung ended up adding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-washed-out-display-is-intentional">a more vibrant color option</a> to the Galaxy S24 Ultra last year, and it's present on the S25 Ultra this year.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Tricks like PWM dimming and FRC color dithering are used to top display quality charts by fooling eyes and calibration equipment into seeing something that doesn't exist.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I spoke with Michael Hamilton, ISF calibration instructor at AVPro South, who helped explain why companies should try to use native 10-bit panels in premium products instead of resorting to 8-bit with FRC dithering.</p><p>"8-bit with Frame Rate Control does not do a very good job of preventing 'banding' and can still exhibit flicker or dithering (like in sky scenes where gradient transients are very subtle)," Hamilton explained.</p><p>"Additionally, when an 8-bit panel with FRC rapidly flashes, 'temporal' artifacts manifest such as a judder-like appearance to motion, or 'floating,' which areas of the image appear to be in motion [when they should not be] and directly adjacent areas are not, such as long-range shots of trees where some appear to be moving in a breeze while others are not, or an expansive water surface moves unnaturally and even the shoreline may appear to be moving.</p><p>Since they are not visible with a static image or patterns, a viewer may see ghosting or motion blur or otherwise motion glitches, and then, to confirm, they pause the video, and the anomaly subsides."</p><p>Hamilton works exclusively on TV calibration, where banding is more noticeable because of the size of the panel. Because of its size, it's unlikely you'll ever notice banding on a smartphone screen, but that hasn't stopped some Redditors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS25Ultra/comments/1ihdwwx/banding_on_25_ultra_is_non_existent_in_irl_it/">from pointing it out</a>.</p>

<p>This methodology is clever from an engineering perspective, but it presents two problems. First off, Samsung is cheating you out of your money by using an 8-bit panel on a $1,300 phone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> uses a true 10-bit panel that doesn't need to dither to show all 1.07 billion colors for the HDR10 standard and provides the same seven-year software update commitment as Samsung.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 does the same thing for even less, even if it <em>only</em> gets six years of software updates. Despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-needs-to-fix-four-major-s24-ultra-display-problems">all the display problems</a> with the Galaxy S24 Ultra last year, Samsung is still using the same M13 AMOLED panel on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, just with a few software hacks to mask the problems it's having with display manufacturing quality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung is putting profit margins ahead of the health of its users, particularly the ones most susceptible to the ill effects of display flicker.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Second, and maybe most egregiously, Samsung's use of color dithering causes some users real pain. This is a similar effect to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, another problem Samsung displays suffer from. Samsung uses low-Hz PWM dimming to save money and achieve a very specific display metric at different brightness intervals.</p><p>Hamilton also explained a few reasons companies use PWM dimming on TVs, although the same concept transfers over to phones:</p><p>"By rapidly flashing the backlight LEDs on and off, a less expensive power supply may be used. The byproduct of this is 'flicker,' which tends to vary depending on the picture mode. Some viewers detect this strobing and flashing, and with fast-moving objects, blurring or 'comet tailing' can be seen.</p><p>Uniformity issues tend to be exacerbated by fewer backlight zones due to cost reduction, and the image can look unevenly illuminated and unnatural in some scenes. These issues can be overcome: just 'bring money.'"</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung is designing its displays for measurement and calibration tools, not the humans who actually use them.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The end is the most illuminating aspect here. Samsung is putting profit margins ahead of the health of its users, particularly the ones most susceptible to the ill effects of display flicker.</p><p>The rest of the industry knows and understands the problems that color dithering and low-Hz PWM dimming can have on some users and has enacted positive change for everyone.</p><p>There's a reason companies like BOE and Visionox — which are found on phones from companies like Nothing, OnePlus, Honor, Motorola, and more — are making OLED panels with native 10-bit reproduction and support for both DC-dimming and significantly faster PWM dimming when needed.</p><p>The Honor Magic 7 Pro is capable of 4320Hz PWM dimming at low brightness while the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra uses 480Hz dimming at all brightness levels. There's a clear spec difference here on multiple levels, and Samsung isn't winning any awards for having the best hardware. Just the best tricks to achieve a specific goal.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Google added colorblind modes to Android L all the way back in 2014, and there's no reason the company can't add a way to disable color dithering or display flickering at the system level.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Aside from pure profit margins, companies like Samsung Display choose to use PWM dimming and dithering on OLED screens because of how the tech works. Because OLED response time is in nanoseconds, unlike LCD, engineers have learned that dialing in the display calibration can achieve near-perfect scores on display quality tests. In other words, Samsung is designing its displays for measurement and calibration tools, not the humans who actually use them.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/dylan-raga/">Dylan Raga</a>, a display reviewer at XDA Developers, explained it very well. Speaking on the subject of calibration and color matching, he told me that "the best current strobeless solution would be for native 10bpc panels with multiple well-calibrated voltage states, using pixel-level dimming in-between them with active spatial DPU dithering."</p><p>In other words, Samsung is doing <em>exactly</em> what's needed to achieve the best scores on display tests, and therein lies the problem.</p><p>Raga went on to say that "a true 12-bit DAC would be ideal, but we’re not really near having those on consumer displays. Our only options that maintain reference picture quality involve using a higher base power for better signal control and modulating it down by some means."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Many display companies have acknowledged the problems that color and light flickering can cause, but, as usual, Samsung, Google, and Apple seem oblivious.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>At this juncture, it seems we're presented with two main solutions to this problem: make displays more like BOE and Visionox or provide users with accessibility options that allow them to disable any "display quality" features that cause them physical harm.</p><p>These other OLED manufacturers have slowly improved their display quality over time while offering eye-friendly options like DC-dimming, which can lower display quality on OLEDs at some brightness levels but always reduce eye strain.</p><p>However, until companies like Google, Apple, and Samsung acknowledge the problem, we're stuck with phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and Galaxy S25 Ultra. Both of these phones top the charts for display quality because of the tricks they use to achieve these metrics. Thankfully, plenty of other companies have acknowledged these problems, but, as usual, it's the big three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">that refuse to accept the science</a>.</p><p>Google added colorblind modes to Android L <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-l-includes-new-display-modes-color-blind-users">all the way back in 2014</a>, and there's no reason the company can't add a way to disable color dithering or display flickering at the system level. Google has the power to set these accessibility options for users at the operating system level, but the company seems clueless about a problem that most of the industry has actively acknowledged. What's it going to take, Google? Samsung? Apple? The ball is in your court.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need an all-flash NAS with powerful internals, good thermals, and ultra-fast connectivity. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the best software features.</p>
<p>The best part of the F8 SSD Plus is that it isn't anywhere as bulky as traditional NAS servers. As it doesn't need to house 3.5-inch drive slots, TerraMaster managed to create a design that's about the size of a router, but you still get eight M.2 slots with good passive and active cooling. You get thermal pads in the packaging to mount over any SSDs you install, and they do a good job ensuring the drives don't overheat. <br><br>There are no issues with connectivity either; the NAS has a 10GbE port at the back, and you get a solitary USB-C port alongside dual USB-A and an HDMI port. The NAS is powered by an 8-core Intel Core i3, and it has 16GB of RAM out of the box; clearly, this is overkill as a Plex server, and it does an outstanding job with 4K media and concurrent streams.<br><br>The only issue is that the software doesn't have the most polished set of features, but you can easily switch over to TrueNAS and install it if you wish to do so. Overall, the F8 SSD Plus is the best of the all-flash NAS models around, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F8-SSD-Plus-NAS/dp/B0D9HWLDX5">at $699</a>, it is a better value than its rivals.</p>

<p>I don't regret being late to the Wear OS party, missing years of buggy updates and terrible battery life. But my colleagues keep bringing up the gorgeous Moto 360 like it's the smartwatch holy grail. Now, I'm waiting impatiently for Motorola to follow in OnePlus and Xiaomi's footsteps and jump back on the Wear OS train.</p><p>I haven't spent that much time with Motorola phones, aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus (2023)</a> that I used to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/only-one-android-phone-could-tempt-my-partner-away-from-her-iphone">tempt my now-fiancee away from her iPhone</a>. I enjoyed the foldable gimmick, but it's hard to stay too invested without a compelling Motorola smartwatch to pair with one.</p><p>Since I joined Android Central, Motorola has stuck with cheap squircles like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-moto-watch-40-budget-fitness-tracker-announced">Moto Watch 40</a> and budget-minded circular models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motowatch.com/moto-watch-120/">Watch 120</a>, with the generic health tracking, week+ battery life, and basic smarts you'd expect in the $70–140 price range.</p><p>I don't blame Motorola for leaving the old version of Android Wear behind. But 2025 should be a transformative year for Wear OS, and even if a new Moto 360 will provide a very <em>stock</em> Wear OS experience, I think it's important for the brand to offer a more complete device package if it wants to stay competitive.</p>

<h2 id="what-motorola-did-right-and-wrong-with-the-moto-360-2">What Motorola did right (and wrong) with the Moto 360</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:745px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6u5MD9XUqpi5dRwSzThxe4" name="Moto-360-side-view" alt="The Moto 360 smartwatch sitting on a desk, the angle emphasizing the rounded metal edge and side button." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6u5MD9XUqpi5dRwSzThxe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="745" height="419" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Moto 360 (2014) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Phil Nickinson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My Moto 360 perspective is entirely second-hand, as no one on staff has one anymore. But our original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-360-review-0">Moto 360 review</a> gushed about its traditional round look at a time when the LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live were square; this watch and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-years-original-huawei-watch-still-one-best-android-wearables">original Huawei Watch</a> helped define "round" as the default <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> look.</p><p>It was far from perfect. It had a chin bezel for the ambient light sensor, a lower PPI than other watches at that time, battery life that required nightly charges — a full day wasn't a guarantee — and the limitations of early Wear software across brands.</p><p>The 2nd-gen Moto 360 (2015) added a crown, slimmed down the bezel (though it kept the sensor chin), improved the battery life, and stuck to the style and sensors that stood out among Wear watches.</p><p>Then Motorola bowed out of the smartwatch game, licensing out the Moto 360 (3rd Gen) to be made by a company called eBuyNow. It had a thick steel design (see below) that didn't quite stand out among Wear OS watches the way its predecessors did. It relied heavily on Google Fit software and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/moto-360-2019" target="_blank">reportedly</a> had poor battery life and connectivity issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2HTnSu8TYhMBCgCZLndAuB" name="Motorola-Moto-360-2020-3rd-generation-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Moto 360 (3rd generation, 2020) Wear OS smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2HTnSu8TYhMBCgCZLndAuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Moto 360 (3rd Gen) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I believe the biggest issues were outside of Motorola's control. It depended on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear hardware and Google's Android Wear software, both of which had significant and documented issues in that early era.</p><p>While I don't have any insider account on Motorola's Wear perspective, we know 2020 was around the time OnePlus's CEO said they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-ceo-says-hes-trying-work-google-improve-wear-os">tried to "work with Google to try to improve"</a> Wear OS for "better device interoperability" between phones and watches, but it gave up and used a proprietary OS for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-watch-review">first OnePlus Watch</a>.</p><p>You also have Xiaomi trying out Android Wear on the Mi Watch in 2019, then leaving it behind until its Watch 2 Pro in 2023.</p><p>The common thread is that Google's 2021 Wear OS partnership with Samsung — and much-improved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> hardware — righted a sinking ship and brought OEMs back into the fold. But Motorola remains a missing link.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-is-too-big-to-depend-on-cheap-rtos-watches-2">Motorola is too big to depend on cheap RTOS watches</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4005px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z6v4VkKxkNVaMthZVwR3FV" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-05.jpg" alt="The Android Bot next to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z6v4VkKxkNVaMthZVwR3FV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4005" height="2253" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Out of the Android OEMs that made Wear watches but haven't used Wear OS 3+ — ASUS, Huawei, LG (RIP), Motorola, OPPO, and ZTE — Motorola feels like the most natural fit with unfinished Wear OS business.</p><p>Parent company Lenovo owned a substantial 5% of the global 2024 smartphone market (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-smartphone-market-2024">Canalys</a>), while Motorola, Honor, and Huawei were the "fastest-growing OEMs among all the top 10 brands" in 2024 (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-research-notes-blogs-smartphone-market-recovers-in-2024-after-two-years-of-decline/">Counterpoint</a>).</p><p>Assuming Motorola phones aren't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-phones-could-be-banned-in-the-us-what-would-that-mean-for-the-market">banned next month</a>, they'll keep their substantial footprint. Foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> are catnip to Android power users, but I suspect they get most of their business from well-made budget phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>.</p><p>Either way, these users are stuck choosing between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> with exclusive features that won't work on Motorola phones, fitness watches without proper messaging, or cheap Moto Watch models that still rely on Google Fit and the most basic health tracking. Only one, the Moto Watch 120, has Bluetooth calling with no LTE and only supports a passthrough version of Google Assistant from your phone.</p>
<h2 id="why-now-s-the-time-for-motorola-to-dive-back-into-wear-os-2">Why now's the time for Motorola to dive back into Wear OS</h2>

<p>Moto 360 watches were held back by the crappy hardware of their time. Now, picture one with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon chip likely coming this year</a>, enhanced with newer cores and AI capabilities, with battery life that consistently lasts a couple of days per charge.</p><p>Then pair it with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> — since Google and Samsung will probably keep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 6</a> to themselves until 2026 — and give Motorola users access to proper wearable apps, with the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade">Gemini-on-Wear-OS update</a> arriving soon after.</p><p>And now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-new-partnership-could-be-the-cure-for-wear-oss-health-data-headaches">Masimo is handling biosensing tech for Wear OS</a>, Motorola could dive right into the ecosystem with a higher standard of health tracking rather than having to play catch-up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QmFCxFKoGPbvD6xfoqSZLB" name="Motorola-Adaptive-Display-MWC-wearing-05.jpg" alt="The Motorola Adaptive Display concept phone at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QmFCxFKoGPbvD6xfoqSZLB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Better a Motorola Wear OS watch than this thing </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most OEMs wouldn't be interested, but Motorola still relies on Google Fit for its RTOS watches, even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-has-set-a-deadline-to-shut-down-the-google-fit-api">API shuts down this year</a>. I think if Motorola had the option to let Google handle the fitness software and could focus on wearable tricks, it would.</p><p>As it is, Motorola is spending a lot of R&D toying with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/motorola-adaptive-display-concept-best-for-sci-fi-not-real-life-use">wearable phones</a> like the ones above that are fun to try out but very impractical and not anything you'd call stylish. It's the exact opposite of the principle that defined the original Moto 360: stepping away from the squarish watches of the time and blending in with traditional accessories.</p><p>Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, I'd be perfectly happy to see a budget Moto Wear OS watch. It could follow the template of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> and Galaxy Watch FE, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">cheap Android watches</a> that would appeal to the same group that buys $200–400 phones. In particular, the 2R has that multi-day battery life that practical Moto fans love.</p><p>Motorola, give us a stock Moto Wear OS watch with Google software that unleashes more smarts, health insights, and fitness tools to Motorola users — and evokes a classic round watch look. Until we get<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-smartwatches-have-a-fashion-problem-hybrids-are-the-answer"> more hybrid smartwatches</a>, we need this brand to come back and fill Fossil's niche, bringing a little more style and class to Wear OS.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Maps has been getting all kinds of fun abilities in the recent past— be it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-weather-related-road-hazards-report-options">ability to report weather-related disruptions</a> or Live Updates of your trip<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-1-gives-us-a-sneak-peek-at-live-updates"> via Android 16 Beta 2</a>,  Google is trying to make Maps more informative and user-friendly.</p><p>However, it falls short of providing all the information that the user needs at one glance. As of now, Google Maps on Android shows only three complications: traffic, distance to the destination, and time taken to travel. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-more-details-in-route-overview/">Android Police tipster Moshe</a> spotted that Google Maps will soon be able to show you additional information on whether or not you'd have parking spots at the destination— indicated by the "P" icon, a fuel-efficient route, and also the exact time users would reach their destination.</p><p>All these details will show up within the first Google Map Overviews window, giving the users a better sense of what the situation at their destination looks like, and helping them plan their trips accordingly— as seen in the screenshots below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="taB8ZU3QNiWb2VVy7qSVcU" name="Google-Maps-Overviews-more-info" alt="New overviews page on Maps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/taB8ZU3QNiWb2VVy7qSVcU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google Maps shows information on parking, fuel efficiency and also ETA  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Police)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As of now, to view fuel-efficient routes on Google Maps, users have to swipe up on the panel at the bottom to see route options, including those marked with a "leaf" icon for fuel efficiency. When a fuel-efficient route is available, Google Maps will display it alongside the fastest route, giving the option for users to pick between the two. It holds the same for information on parking and ETA (estimated time of arrival) as well.</p><p>While we aren't sure when this feature will roll out to people at large, the publication added that the tipster likely "got early access due to his high-tier Local Guide status on Google Maps." It seems like this feature is currently being tested on a small scale and will likely show up in the upcoming app updates.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K8iG34nKWfg5mUiww8CZ4k" name="google-maps-navigation-1-hero-wide.jpg" alt="Google Maps navigation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8iG34nKWfg5mUiww8CZ4k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central has reached out to Google for a rollout timeline about the same and we will update this article once we have more information.</p><p>In other news, earlier this month <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/a-google-maps-bug-is-wiping-out-timeline-history-for-some-users">Google Maps users ran into an issue</a> where their entire Timeline history disappeared on the web version. Even though their Timeline is enabled, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> is showing a "No visits for this day," pop-up on their screens. This could have something to do with Google’s recent move to store location history directly on devices instead of in the cloud. This could also mean that Google is steering away from the web version and keeping fresh updates exclusive to the app.</p>

These earbuds are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof/dp/B09DT48V16">back down to $25 as part of Amazon's Big Spring Sale</a>, and that's a steal considering the sound quality they offer. Clearly, I'm not the only one who agrees that these are a terrific deal — the earbuds have racked up over 10,000 sales in the last month on Amazon alone, with a score of 4.4/5 from over 70,000 ratings on the platform.</p>

<p>There isn't much in the way of a distinctive design, but the X08 is available in eight color options, so you can pick up the buds in your favorite color. The case has an LED at the front that shows the charge level of the buds, and it is a nice addition. Battery life is pretty great, with the buds lasting just under six hours between charges. <br><br>They have a lightweight design and a comfortable fit that ensures there's no fatigue even with extended use. The IPX5 water resistance makes the X08 a good choice while running or working out, and there are zero issues with connectivity — I used the buds with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and it maintained a rock-solid signal. <br><br>The sound quality is the real differentiator; the X08 just doesn't sound like most budget earbuds, delivering a vibrant and engaging sound with plenty of vigor. <br>Basically, these are the best-sounding budget earbuds I've ever used, and I tested over well over a hundred earbuds over the last half-decade.</p><p>There are gesture controls as well, but they tend to be a little finicky at times. Outside of that, I didn't see any problems with the X08. Their retail price in itself is a good deal, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof/dp/B09DT48V16">but at $25</a>, there's just no reason not to get these earbuds.</p>

Buyers can expect a full day's worth of battery, health and sleep tracking, and fitness features such as Workout Builder, Cardio Load, and Morning Brief.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a smartwatch with a wide range of health and sleep monitoring features; having a long battery life is important to you; you have other Google and Pixel devices and want a highly integrated ecosystem.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a hyper-accurate GPS watch; you need something super durable; you're looking for a watch with industry-leading OS updates.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-for-wear-os">best Android smartwatch with Wear OS</a>, and there's more than one reason why. Perhaps most of all, we love the Pixel Watch 3's large 1.27-inch AMOLED display and the easy-to-use Wear OS. Whether you're a casual user or you're looking to watch your health more closely, this smartwatch has a broad range of health, sleep, and fitness monitoring features that buyers appreciate.</p><p>It's worth noting that while this watch does include GPS, it's definitely not as accurate as those with multi-band GPS, such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 or one of Garmin's many GPS watches. Pixel Watches also come with one fewer Wear OS update than those of Samsung's Galaxy devices, which could be a deal-breaker for some buyers who want something as future-proof as possible.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-big-spring-sale-2025-best-deals-for-android"><em><strong>See our guide to the best deals for Android users during Amazon's Big Spring Sale</strong></em></a></p>

<ul><li>Google announced increased safety measures that will roll out soon to its Play Store.</li><li>In an attempt to create a safer Android Ecosystem, Google will expand Play Protect to “target malicious applications that try to impersonate financial apps."</li><li>It will start adding more verified badges to help users identify and validate genuine apps — “Verified” for VPNs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/03/keeping-google-play-safe.html"> announced today </a>that it will be extensively working on making its Play Store a safer platform for both app developers as well as users. In a lengthy Android Developers' blog post, the company chalked out protection plans for 2025 that will make it easier for developers to build safe apps right from the get-go, which will help users recognize "real" apps from fraudulent ones.</p><p>To start, Google Play Protect, which has its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/11/new-real-time-protections-on-Android.html" target="_blank">live threat detection</a> in place, is  expanding its protection to target more "malicious applications that try to impersonate financial apps."</p><p>Recently, the Google Play Store was impacted by a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mass-app-deletion-underway-confirmed"> massive ad fraud</a> that made users download "vapor apps" disguised as genuine popular apps. These ran recurring ads, making it difficult for users to delete and generating tons of revenue for fraudsters. After that, Google had to take down 180 apps from the platform.</p><p>Google started warning users when it detected an unsafe app that originated from sources outside of Google Play. The tech giant will also be expanding its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/02/piloting-new-ways-to-protect-Android-users-from%20financial-fraud.html" target="_blank">financial fraud protection pilot</a> to additional countries where it has seen "higher levels of malware-based financial fraud."</p><p>The blog further adds that the company's most recent analysis found over "50 times more Android malware" from sources outside the Play Store like internet browsers and messaging apps, likely from users clicking on scam texts or links.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PwTCf9vyKJxtkDf6YBFTF7" name="Google-Play-Store-hero-AC.jpg" alt="Google Play Store homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PwTCf9vyKJxtkDf6YBFTF7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"This year we’re working on ways to make it even harder for malicious actors to hide or trick users into harmful installs, which will not only protect your business from fraud but also help users download your apps with confidence," the blog stated.</p><p>Furthermore, the company is going to add a "verified badge" on specific VPN apps to help users discover more secure VPNs and will expand this to other app categories in the future.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e8REYWW3YVxzJzLKLWVfKN" name="Google-Play-Protection" alt="Stats of developers using Play Integrity APIs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8REYWW3YVxzJzLKLWVfKN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Developers Blog)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>App developers will also see tools to help protect their apps/businesses from fraud. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity" target="_blank">Play Integrity API</a> tool, which helps keep fraud, bots, cheating, and data theft at bay, will see “stronger protection for even more users” that will help them "re-identify abusive and risky devices in a way that also preserves user privacy." Google is also working on self-help tools that allow users to solve issues "for when they're using a tampered version of the app." These features will be rolled out to developers as early as May.</p><p>Lastly, Google is leaning in on the importance of feedback from developers through new features in Console and Android Studio. The Google Play Developer Help Community will also include more languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese, catering to a wider audience.</p>

<ul><li>Android Auto 14.0 is stable and rolling out publicly through a Google Play Store update now.</li><li>The update, which could take weeks to appear for everyone, doesn't seem to have any new features.</li><li>An APK teardown of the update hints at Gemini features coming to Android Auto screens soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android Auto 14.0 is beginning to roll out to users as an update in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play Store</a>, as first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/25/android-auto-14-0-update-gemini-preparation/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Although the Android Auto 14.0 update does not appear to include any new features or behavior changes, there are a few signs included within that hint at Gemini soon replacing Google Assistant.</p><p>This shouldn't come as a huge shock, since Google revealed earlier this month that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Gemini would officially replace Assistant on most devices</a> by the end of 2025. There are already hints that Gemini could eventually reach Google TV, Android Auto, and Nest hardware. Now that Android Auto 14.0 is stable and rolling out, there are more code strings that preview how Gemini could take over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> screens.</p><p>One prompt in particular, hidden in the Android Auto 14.0 APK, reads "Gemini is now the personal AI assistant in your car."</p><p>9to5Google also revealed the following code strings in Android Auto 14.0 that hint at future Gemini features, prompts, and survey questions:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name=”assistant_education_tooltip_gemini_upgrade”>Gemini is now the personal AI assistant in your car</string>
<string name=”assistant_summarization_quick_feedback_prompt”>How was the message summary content?</string>
<string name=”csat_survey_question_gemini”>How satisfied were you with Gemini in Android Auto today?</string>
<string name=”csat_survey_question_voice_subjourney”>What was your primary goal for using voice interaction in Android Auto today? Select the task that had the biggest impact on your satisfaction.</string>
<string name=”gemini_quick_feedback_prompt”>How was your Gemini experience?</string></code></pre>
<p>Aside from the code strings, there are also various images for both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Gemini Live included in the Android Auto 14.0 update. However, these strings aren't live, so don't expect to use them after updating to the latest version of Android Auto. At the time of publishing, you can't use Gemini in Android Auto just yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9CjKbkmiF9o3kcwsXYsbTd" name="Android-Auto-Mercedes-Waze-map.jpg" alt="Android Auto running split-screen with Waze in Mercedes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9CjKbkmiF9o3kcwsXYsbTd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, it appears that Google is gearing up to make the big switch from Assistant to Gemini on Android Auto soon. We've already seen that Gemini features can be manually enabled, and the latest image assets and code strings in Android Auto 14.0 are yet another sign that the transition could occur imminently.</p><p>It's unclear when exactly the Gemini experience will become available for Android Auto users.</p>

<ul><li>An APK teardown reveals that Google could be working on letting you upload up to ten images onto Gemini.</li><li>As of now, users can only upload one image and additional images get replaced with the one that has been uploaded onto the chatbot.</li><li>This feature showed up on the beta version of the Google app v16.11.32.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been making several improvements to Gemini's capabilities, bringing more features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-new-gemini-live-experience-with-saved-audio-recordings">Gems, Gemini Live and screen recording </a>to the free tier. However, the most basic ability to upload multiple images on to the AI chatbot seems to be missing—but this could change soon.</p><p>An<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-multi-image-upload-apk-teardown-3538149/"> APK teardown</a> performed by folks at Android Authority via Assemble Debug seems to have revealed a hidden feature that allows users to upload multiple images with a limit of 10 pictures at once.</p><p>Currently, users can upload only one image per prompt. If they try to upload more images, Gemini will ask if they'd like to replace the already uploaded file with a new one. This limits the user's need to give Gemini more information to get an all-around analysis of several images in one go.</p>

<p>The publication added that, with the Google app <em><strong>v16.11.32 beta</strong></em>, they were able to activate the ability to upload multiple images for analysis in the Gemini app. They assume that this feature was already tested and made functional for users but has been hidden for the masses to be released through an update in the future.</p><p>Once this feature was enabled during the teardown, they were able to attach up to 10 images onto Gemini's app within a single prompt, and Gemini was able to analyze all the images in one go, describing what those images contained. This feature would significantly reduce the time it takes for users to upload one image in each prompt and then wait to upload the next for the chatbot to interpret, as seen in the screenshot above.</p><p>While we don't know if and when this feature will roll out to users on a larger scale. However, since it seems pretty functional, this rollout could happen in the near future.</p><p>Furthermore, Google has just released its most advanced AI model — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in"> </a>starting today to its Gemini Advanced subscribers. The company says it is building thinking capabilities into all its Gemini 2.5 models, moving to enable complex problem-solving abilities and serve as context-aware AI agents</p>

Skip that process altogether and you'll still be guaranteed to receive a $150 discount, the exact same price drop that you can find at Amazon right now. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10/buy/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-256gb-moonstone-gray-wi-fi-sm-x820nzaaxar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="252a65a8-548f-43ae-80f1-b61a67f400c5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus 256GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus 256GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is all about balance, coming complete with a gorgeous 12.4-inch 120Hz display, powerful MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ with 12GB of RAM, and all of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> software features.

You can also pair the purchase of the tablet with the Galaxy Watch 7 to save 38% on the watch, or grab an accompanying keyboard book cover to get 50% off.</p><p>Needless to say, there are a ton of money-saving opportunities all over the web this week, but before you buy that Galaxy device from Amazon, take a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/"><strong>Samsung&apos;s deal page</strong></a> to make sure you aren&apos;t missing anything special. </p>

<hr>
<p>The anticipation for One UI 7 continues as Samsung is spotted rolling out another beta update for its foldables.</p><p>Tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1904429676430553536">Tarun Vats on X</a> posted a snapshot of Samsung's One UI 7 Beta 3 patch rolling out for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-3-update/">SamMobile</a>). The post states the update was initially rolling out for enrolled testers in South Korea, but the publication claims it's been spotted on "international variants," too. Interestingly, Beta 3 brings the April security patch to the foldables.</p><p>Marked as version ZYCG, the tipster states the update is roughly 1.2GB in size.</p><p>The publication provided a look at its changelog for English users, which shows "new features" for the foldables, like the ability to "press and hold the side button to launch the digital assistant." The devices gain call recording summaries (in text), webpage summaries, and natural-language search in Settings.</p><p>A couple of larger Galaxy AI features via One UI 7 include the ability to "edit video sounds" and custom image and sticker creation. As the post notes, these are referencing Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a> AI features. The patch finishes with a few bug fixes for widget errors, overlapping problems, and media card issues in One UI 7.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-sketch-to-image-multimodal-updates-teased">teased a few advancements</a> coming for its AI-based Sketch to Image in One UI 7 back in January. The company stated the changes were centered around making the feature more "multimodal." Its upgrades let users utilize their S Pens, as well as the option of text descriptions and voice commands. One of its goals was to make Sketch to Image more available to users who'd rather use other means to generate an image.</p><p>More importantly, users can combine a rough sketch with their text/voice descriptions to make a more complete idea for the AI to polish up for you. While not explicitly stated in the patch notes, it appears that these One UI 7 upgrades have fallen onto Samsung's latest foldables in Beta 3.</p>

<p>It might make some users happy, considering One UI 7's AI features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">demand a lot from a phone</a>. An interview with Samsung's EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally, highlighted that not every past-gen Galaxy device will see <em>every </em>AI feature. Some tools, like its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">Personal Data Engine</a>, require stronger internal hardware, like Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. As such, many "deeper AI experiences" will be left out of the software's debut on older phones.</p><p>The Flip 6 and Fold 6 started receiving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">the first beta</a> at the beginning of April. The initial download was roughly 5GB and packed many AI features and improvements that the Galaxy S24 first received in its Beta 1. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">was expected</a>, but we are still awaiting One UI 7's grand rollout for users without a Galaxy S25. One UI 7 is expected to arrive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-us-deletes-april-10-one-ui-7-announcement-post">officially on April 10</a> for the Galaxy S24, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and Fold 6.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing is pushing an update for its recent budget phone duo that introduces a new Essential feature and cleans up a few messes.</p><p>Kicking off the March 25 update for the Nothing Phone 3a Series is Essential Key compatibility with the Camera app. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/29173-nothing-os-31-update-for-3a-series">community post</a>, the company states this update for the new physical button concerns the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and its 3a Pro</a> sibling. The Nothing OS 3.1 update features a quick video of how this will work for users.</p><p>In short, opening the Nothing camera app and pressing the Essential Key will take a photo, but save it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a> area on your device. Users can then attach a written note to remind them of what the photo signifies.</p><p>Alternatively, long-pressing the key when in the camera app lets you add a voice memo.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="sAu6w484CGfXudommoGmda" name="nothing-phone-3a-pro-essential-key-camera-demo" alt="The Nothing camera app receives support for the Essential Key on the Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sAu6w484CGfXudommoGmda.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 3a and the 3a Pro will also receive a series of camera improvements once more. The changelog states the update brings more "intuitive" camera zoom interactions. The update "enhances white balance" for the rear cameras, improves "clarity and tone" for portraits in backlit scenarios, and improves the responsiveness of the camera.</p><p>Additionally, Nothing states it's fixed a strange "reddish skin tone issue in front-facing camera selfies." The Phone 3a Pro gets one specific camera change, which improves the focusing accuracy when utilizing 2x focal length.</p><p>The remainder of the patch notes for the 3a and the 3a Pro is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Optimised Essential Space experience and performance</li><li>Improved AOD (Always-On Display) transition animations</li><li>Various bug fixes and stability improvements.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P8q6NDMBoxMRVbjBh6BUiU" name="nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-3a-pro-back-03" alt="Comparing the transparent backs of the grey Nothing Phone (3a) Pro with the white Nothing Phone (3a)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P8q6NDMBoxMRVbjBh6BUiU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update has started rolling out; however, Nothing urges patience with its users, stating the patch is "gradually" making its rounds. Users can manually check if they have the update by hopping into <strong>Settings > System > System Updates</strong>. What's more, the company detailed its upcoming plans for the Essential Space, including Smart Collections, Focused Search, and Flip to Record.</p><p>Technically, this is the second update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">the 3a Pro</a>, as the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-3a-pro-gains-first-update-ahead-of-release">was a pre-launch OTA</a> that dropped right as the phones launched. There were a wealth of camera updates to improve its clarity in macro mode and performance for better photo quality. Moreover, Nothing's update helped its Essential Key and Space features, adding widgets and improving the button's interactions.</p><p>Aside from that, Nothing started emailing consumers in a few overseas areas <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-pre-order-shipping-delay-email">about a shipment delay</a> for pre-ordered Phone 3a Pros. The email mostly concerned those in Europe, as the company states devices pre-ordered will now "ship before April 15."</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, is rolling out starting today, March 25, with an experimental release of Gemini 2.5 Pro, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#gemini-2-5-thinking">blog post</a>. Gemini 2.5 is Google's "most intelligent AI model" yet, per the company. The experimental version of Gemini 2.5 Pro backs up that claim, ranking first on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard" target="_blank">LMArena's leaderboard</a> — ahead of Grok 3, GPT-4.5, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek R1</a>.</p><p>Google has been ramping up its AI development, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-flash-thinking-and-pro-experimental-models-are-hitting-the-gemini-app">releasing the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model</a> last month. It can conduct multi-step reasoning and use certain techniques to reach a conclusion, all while the end user can trace its reasoning process in real time.</p><p>This time around, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 models</a> are thinking models, and are "capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding, resulting in enhanced performance and improved accuracy."</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro sits atop many of the benchmarks and leaderboards for large language models (LLMs), and Google says it achieved this feat by "combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.13%;"><img id="jT62sfundccz4jwMuZZwWX" name="Gemini-2.5-Benchmarks" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jT62sfundccz4jwMuZZwWX.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="2556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The release and development of Gemini 2.5 is intended to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">push Google further into the agentic era</a>. The company says it is building thinking capabilities into all its Gemini 2.5 models moving forward so that they can solve complex problems and serve as context-aware AI agents.</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro also performs well in knowledge, science, and math benchmarks. It scored 18.8% on Humanity’s Last Exam without tool use, which beats all other competitors by a significant margin. Google describes this test as "a dataset designed by hundreds of subject matter experts to capture the human frontier of knowledge and reasoning."</p>

<p>With native multimodality, this series of Gemini AI models can intake text, audio, images, video, and large code repositories for extra context.</p><p>Additionally, Gemini 2.5 Pro is said to perform better at coding, hence why it is shipping today in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-used-the-gemini-api-and-ai-studio-to-make-the-i-o-2025-puzzle">Google AI Studio</a>. It'll also come to Vertex AI at a later date.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-2-5-pro-pricing-and-availability-2">Gemini 2.5 Pro pricing and availability </h2>
<p>Gemini 2.5 Pro is available starting today for business and personal accounts with a one million token context window. It's available in Google AI Studio and the Gemini web client and mobile apps. Currently, Gemini 2.5 Pro is exclusive to Gemini Advanced and requires a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a> ($20/month).</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro will arrive in Vertex AI in the coming weeks, and its context window will soon expand to two million tokens.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly "planning" to introduce several third-party apps into the fold for One UI 7's Now Bar.</li><li>Many are still unknown; however, rumors state Kakao T, Naver Sports, YouTube, and YouTube Music could be on the way.</li><li>A rumor from mid-March claimed Samsung was looking into "forced" third-party support and more customization options for the Now Bar via Good Lock.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors are surfacing again about Samsung's apparent interest in expanding app support for a key One UI 7 feature.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20250324000350?">ETNews</a> (Korean) claims Samsung is "planning" to introduce several third-party apps to users with Now Bar compatibility (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/25/samsung-now-bar-third-party-apps-report/#more-666321">9to5Google</a>). The Korean OEM is reportedly going to bring these additional apps to One UI 7's Now Bar with "cross-app actions." As the post notes, this is one of the key features of the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23">Galaxy S25 series</a>, so it seems there's a chance Samsung wants to keep this consistent even with third-party additions.</p><p>Regarding what Samsung could bring, there's speculation from an alleged industry source that the Now Bar could add Kakao T and Naver Sports. The former is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/service/service/KakaoT?lang=en">transportation app</a> in South Korea responsible for taxis, driver bookings, and scooter sharing. The post states the addition of Naver Sports could be similar to the likes of Google Sports.</p><p>There is more to be expected; however, the report didn't express what those could be. However, it curiously highlights YouTube and YouTube Music, stating those apps are "not yet installed." It seems Samsung is moving to bring those into the Now Bar (which would be nice), but nothing's clear just yet.</p>

<p>Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-good-lock-now-bar-module-rumored">surfaced a week ago</a> about Samsung's alleged plans for the future of the Now Bar, which includes third-party apps. Though a small mention, a tipster claimed Samsung was moving along with an update that would bring "forced support for all third-party apps." Fortunately, this new South Korean report gives us a better idea of what <em>might </em>show up for the Now Bar if all goes well.</p><p>The core of that previous rumor was the new customization features the company is supposedly working on. Speculation states the Now Bar will receive a dedicated Good Lock module that'll let users change its color, size, and animations.</p><p>Meanwhile, that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-lock-screen-now-bar-update-rollout">Google Sports update</a> for the Now Bar dropped earlier this month. The patch essentially made it easier for users to see the scores they want and keep up with their favorite teams in a streamlined way. Users can browse through "Following" and "Recommended" sports/team tabs, as well as a full list of available organizations. That update for One UI 7 made it even easier for users to manage their notifications, too.</p>

<p>With the Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series </a>out of the way, we've been seeing some insane Galaxy S26 leaks coming in. The most recent one brings more input on the high-end Ultra model's cameras.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/wild-galaxy-s26-ultra-rumor-hints-at-insane-camera-upgrades/">SammyGuru</a> spotted a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SiddhantGeek/status/1904490741394473052"> post on X,</a> that revealed extensive specs of the cameras that the Samsung Galaxy S26 could come with. Siddhant B, claims that these specs were first put out by avid tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve" target="_blank">@Jukanlosreve,</a> known for leaking Samsung-related news.</p><p>The post by Siddhant claims that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will come with a variable aperture, on its primary wide 200MP lens. This means, that the user could change the aperture of the lens while taking a picture. The aperture could vary anywhere between f/1.4 and f/4.0. This would allow users to manually pick the desired f-stop based on the primary light they have while shooting pictures. In retrospect, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's wide lens comes with an unchangeable f/1.7 aperture setting.</p><p>Aperture is measured in f-stops, which determines how much light enters the lens providing better-quality images. For instance, a wider opening of the lens allows more light to enter the camera, resulting in a brighter image in low-light settings. While smaller lens opening allows for less light to enter the lens, which is ideal when shooting outdoors on a sunny day(aka, f/4.0 could be the aperture setting in this situation).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the X post states that while the Galaxy S26 Ultra will keep its predecessor's 200 MP wide lens, it will also be taking the 50MP ultra-wide camera along as well, which has a 1/2.52-inch sensor with 0.7µm pixels, 13mm focal length, and an f/1.9 fixed aperture.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster claims that the Korean OEM will be ditching Galaxy S25 Ultra's 10MP telephoto lens for a larger 50 MP lens with a 3.5x optical zoom, which has a 1/3.15inch sensor, 80mm focal length that will have a F/2.4 aperture. The other telephoto lens won't be left behind, since it will get an 8x zoom, an upgrade from the 5x optical zoom on its predecessor. This 50MP lens will have a 184mm focal length, and a  1/2.76-inch sensor, with an f/3.0 aperture.</p><p>As of now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi's 14 Ultra </a>showcases variable aperture, alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-50-launch">Huawei's Mate 50 Pro</a> and if these rumors were even close to being true, then the Galaxy S26 Ultra could come with a much-needed camera upgrade that will allow users more control over clicking photos on the device. That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">another rumor claims </a>that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will come with subtle hardware changes like thinner bezels, and could see charging capabilities between 45W to 50W. While additional leaks are expected to keep coming in throughout the year, here's what we expect to see from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">next Galaxy flagship series.</a></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-airpods-max-work-android-phones">AirPods Max</a> might be the most controversial pair of headphones on the planet. At $549, they are ridiculously expensive and feature controversial design decisions — like a heavy aluminum construction and no power button. On March 24, Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/lossless-audio-and-ultra-low-latency-audio-come-to-airpods-max/" target="_blank">announced</a> that AirPods Max (USB-C) will gain support for lossless, wired audio and low-latency Bluetooth audio in an update next month.</p><p>But is that enough to move the needle for AirPods Max, an expensive and flawed pair of over-ear headphones?</p><p>Make no mistake: the AirPods Max should've supported wired audio from the very beginning. In fact, the older Lightning version of AirPods Max <em>did</em> support wired audio, albeit with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK22AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-audio-cable-12m-white" target="_blank">$35 proprietary cable</a> that's no longer sold by Apple. However, when the company refreshed the headphones with a USB-C variant, that feature was seemingly dropped.</p><p>Now, Apple is bringing wired audio back to the AirPods Max, this time using the USB-C to USB-C cable that comes in the box. It's also selling a USB-C to 3.5mm cable for the new AirPods Max separately for other audio sources. At face value, this update — when it reaches AirPods Max (USB-C) owners in April — seems like a big upgrade. That is until you realize that almost all of Apple's competitors already supported wired audio on their over-ears.</p>

<p>Two of my favorite AirPods Max competitors for Android, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/dyson-ontrac-review">Dyson OnTrac</a>, shipped with wired audio capabilities from day one. Sonos includes a USB-C to USB-C and a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in the box, while Dyson sells a USB-C to 3.5mm cable separately for $20. The same goes for other excellent over-ear headphones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a>.</p><p>Put simply, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> already support the feature Apple is just adding to the AirPods Max next month — it's not exactly groundbreaking.</p><p>Even Apple's own Beats headphones have worked with wired inputs for years. The current generation of Beats Studio Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review">Beats Solo 4</a> both support wired use, not only with a USB-C to USB-C cable but also with an inbuilt 3.5mm jack. That means the Studio Pro and Solo 4, both of which are Apple-made headphones costing a fraction of the price of AirPods Max, are actually more versatile.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2GVxL8kxeA2fWn5PHetDjK" name="beats-solo-4-usbc-aux-ports.jpg" alt="Beats Solo 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2GVxL8kxeA2fWn5PHetDjK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Beats Solo 4 cost under $200 and have two wired audio ports: USB-C and 3.5mm. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update heading to AirPods Max (USB-C) units in April was long overdue. Despite the headphones costing a fortune, they weren't truly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">"lossless" or "high-fidelity"</a> due to their reliance on wireless connection. When AirPods Max get the ability to use a cable, they'll finally unlock 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio.</p><p>Aside from the sound quality boost, there are a few practical benefits to using a cable. For instance, most airlines still rely on the 3.5mm jack for inflight entertainment. Unless you want to be using the cheap, tinny earbuds flight attendants pass around instead of your $549 headphones, you'll want them to support wired audio.</p><p>That's why I'm glad Apple finally got onboard — every pair of over-ear headphones should have a wired audio option.</p>
<h2 id="airpods-max-still-aren-t-a-great-buy-2">AirPods Max still aren't a great buy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="XgnvFNbWprf8irnWmbTi6j" name="Apple-AirPods-hero-240909_big.jpg.large_2x" alt="AirPods lineup, including the USB-C AirPods Max." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgnvFNbWprf8irnWmbTi6j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1960" height="1102" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's the thing: AirPods Max are still an incomplete product, even with the latest set of upgrades. When Apple upgraded the AirPods Max, it added USB-C and new colors and not much else. To that end, the $130 AirPods 4 are using newer chips and audio technology than the $549 AirPods Max. The same goes for the $249 AirPods Pro 2 and Powerbeats Pro 2.</p><p>With the incoming update, Apple is touting that AirPods Max (USB-C) will support ultra-low latency audio over a wireless connection with Apple devices. But as it turns out, AirPods Max won't support wireless lossless audio with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a>. Of course, there aren't that many Vision Pro owners out there, but with that being said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-vs-airpods-pro-2">AirPods Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> both support this feature thanks to their newer H2 chip.</p><p>It underscores that this feature drop for AirPods Max doesn't change the fact that they are lacking not only compared to competitors but also to Apple's own products. AirPods Max (USB-C) should've supported wired audio from the beginning. Even when it does, plenty of alternatives—like the QuietComfort Ultra, Sonos Ace, and Sony WH-1000XM5—will still be a better option at roughly half the price.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new rumor claims that Qualcomm might scrap the "Elite" branding for its next chipset and go with Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead.</p><p>According to leaker Digital Chat Station on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pk8WP9umB" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, Qualcomm is gearing up to introduce the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 next month (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Not-Elite-Snapdragon-8s-Gen-4-leak-outs-launch-info-and-key-details-of-the-Snapdragon-8s-Gen-3-successor.986339.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). We’ve already got some early specs floating around thanks to recent leaks, giving us a sneak peek at what this chip is packing under the hood.</p><p>Keeping up with Qualcomm’s chip lineup isn’t easy, but the flagship series is a bit more straightforward. Qualcomm typically launches a top-tier SoC along with an “s” variant for budget-friendly flagships each year. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> getting some pretty positive market feedback, all eyes are now on the upcoming sub-flagship chipset.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">Contrary to earlier speculations</a>, DCS says Qualcomm is ditching the Snapdragon 8s Elite name in favor of Snapdragon 8s Gen 4.</p><p>The name change likely comes down to architecture. Unlike the Snapdragon 8 Elite with Qualcomm’s custom Oryon cores, the the 8s Gen 4 is sticking with off-the-shelf ARM designs.</p>
<h2 id="power-and-efficiency-mix-2">Power and efficiency mix</h2>
<p>According to DCS, the chip, designed as SN8735, will pack a 3.21GHz Cortex-X4 Prime Core, backed by three 3.01GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores for heavy lifting. For better efficiency, it's expected to also include two 2.02GHz Cortex-A720 cores.</p><p>On the graphics front, the new chip is expected to rock an Adreno 825 GPU. They're from the same next-gen family, but leaks suggest Qualcomm might be trimming down the core size a bit. This means you'll still get great mobile gaming performance; just don't expect it to quite match the absolute top-tier 8 Elite's graphical muscle.</p><p>In a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pka9pm13K" target="_blank">Weibo post</a>, the leaker says the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 will use the same ISP as the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Plus, at least four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are already in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm/the-first-snapdragon-8s-elite-phones-could-launch-next-month-leaker-claims">the works with this chip</a>, including the Redmi Turbo 4 Pro, iQOO Z10 Turbo Pro, Xiaomi Civi 5 Pro, and Oppo K13 Pro.</p><p>Reports suggest Qualcomm will launch the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 in April.</p>

<p>Samsung is reportedly working on another XR gear that will launch alongside its XR headset via Project Moohan. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250321000270">ETNews</a>, the Korean OEM is working on launching its first pair of XR smart glasses dubbed Project "HAEAN" which loosely translates to the sea coast or seashore according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-could-soon-be-able-to-explain-its-translations-better">Google Translate</a>.</p><p>According to the publication, the company is working on finalizing what these glasses will set out to do. Much like the XR headset, it could be powered by Galaxy AI, and will be much smaller than the head-mounted XR gear.</p><p>"They display information or images on the glasses like the lenses of glasses and transmit sound from the frame," the publication added.</p><p>These glasses will likely be pitted against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">Meta's RayBan </a>smart glasses, which can be worn outdoors and interact with the surroundings, possibly with the help of AI. Previous<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-smart-glasses-unpacked-2025-glimpse-tipped"> leaks</a> indicated that they could weigh around 50 grams, have multiple cameras, and be coupled with the ability to make payments and respond to gestures and facial recognition.</p><p>It is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-android-xr-smart-glasses-haean-3537694/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJO3yZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHcTasEBO75KHlBx9GeyYRLuDyhb1cFulna83N_CnGHnirRlseB3swMJWKw_aem_lLsEiYPhvF8INj5anR-i8g">claimed</a> that these glasses could carry a Qualcomm chipset, and an NXP chip will be used as the auxiliary processing unit. The device could allegedly have a 12 MP camera with a Sony IMX681 CMOS image sensor. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-android-xr-smart-glasses-haean-3537694/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJO3yZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHcTasEBO75KHlBx9GeyYRLuDyhb1cFulna83N_CnGHnirRlseB3swMJWKw_aem_lLsEiYPhvF8INj5anR-i8g">SamMobile</a> indicated that these mixed reality glasses will have a "155mAh battery Google's Gemini LLM will be installed on the device to provide AI features."</p>

<p>ETnews adds that Samsung is making sure that these glasses are comfortable to wear and is "putting a lot of effort into a design tailored to the human body."</p><p>Last year, Samsung even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses-trademark-approval-spotted">trademarked</a> its smart glasses at the Intellectual Property Office in the U.K. It was filed under the “Virtual reality headsets; Augmented reality headsets; Headphones; Smartphones; Smart glasses” categories.</p><p>An industry insider to ETnews, “With Apple’s Vision Pro already on the market, Samsung’s focus will be on providing a more advanced user experience.” While we don't know when these XR glasses could see the light of day, the publication very confidently says that it will be launched alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">XR headset </a>which is expected to launch later this year, after Samsung showed it off more vividly at the MWC 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus has a new accessory for its users to charge their phones effortlessly and that too in a smaller form factor.</p><p>Dubbed OnePlus Slim Magnetic Power Bank, it will be available for purchase through the OnePlus website for the U.S. market for $70. As the name suggests, the latest power bank is quite slimmer measuring 0.88cm in height at its thinnest. It further measures 9.6cm in length and 6.9cm in width.</p>

<p>On the whole, it will weigh around 120 grams. It is believed to be done by using high energy density battery cells, next to N52M magnets, and “a body composed of aluminum alloy to reduce overall thickness and weight,” OnePlus shares in an accompanying press release.</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus Slim power bank packs in a decent 5000mAh battery capacity that provides USB Type-C charging next to supporting wireless charging, which claims to charge two iPhones at a time — since it is MagSafe compatible. There aren’t faster wireless charging speeds as they are limited to 7.5W for iPhones and 10W for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Even in the wired charging case, the power bank is limited to 10W wired charging.</p>

<p>Other perks of the power bank comprise NTC intelligent temperature control, which promises to ensure that the battery does not overheat when charging. It is a four-bar LED power status indicator to give you an idea of the juice left in the power bank.</p><p>To ensure safer travel, OnePlus Slim is in compliance with international air transport regulations, meaning it can be easily carried in planes and bullet trains to keep your devices charged at all times.</p>
<p>Lastly, the company is also offering a bunch of bundle offers (from March 25 to April 30) for those who purchase this power bank coupled with its latest flagship phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. And for those who have purchased the OnePlus 13 already — they’ll have special offers if they make the purchase via the company website.</p>

The design looks to be a sleeker version of the Apple Vision Pro, but at this point, there's no mention of what the headset weighs, and the materials used in its construction. <br><br>Vivo says it will debut the prototype in mid-2025, and other than that, it didn't divulge much in the way of information around the headset. The MR headset is a part of Vivo's strategy to "strengthen its real-time spatial computing capabilities for future applications in consumer robotics," and coinciding with the design showcase, Vivo is announcing the establishment of a new robotics laboratory in China.</p>

<p>Vivo will leverage the lab to build the "brain" and "eyes" of robots, utilizing its skillset when it comes to "AI large learning models and imaging." Vivo clearly is no stranger to doing a great job with imaging, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> is currently the best camera phone to beat. So it will be interesting to see how the brand can translate these proficiencies to robotics. <br><br>Switching back to phones, Vivo has announced that it will unveil the X200 Ultra in the month of April. The manufacturer teased the camera modules last week, and earlier leaks gave us a better understanding of what the device will be able to deliver in this area, and having tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> as well as the X200 Pro, I can't wait to get my hands on the X200 Ultra and see how Vivo manages to outshine the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> from last year. <br><br>However, it is likely the X200 Ultra may not debut outside China — much like its predecessor. We should know more about the device in the coming weeks, along with details on the Vivo Vision.</p>

<p>Motorola’s next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable flagship</a> is already making moves, popping up in certification filings ahead of launch, and a new regulatory listing hints at some serious hardware upgrades inside.</p><p>A new listing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://zd.taf.org.cn/#/equipmentDetail?code=34JfIVH%2BvTrlMf8jYpLKnS3dxml4OPYSqQZKXiv6M0hgV5NTK9C621FDd6Y0%2F9AtLR7k9WyZIlDX3aQ4d%2BWDSw%3D%3D" target="_blank">TENAA</a>, China's telecommunications certification authority, sheds light on a new device called the Motorola Razr 60 Ultra, which is expected to be the global name for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr Plus 2025</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_60_ultra_appears_on_tenaa_with_huge_battery_increase-news-67071.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>According to the listing shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZionsAnvin/status/1903651511759986956" target="_blank">Anvin on X</a>, the Razr Plus 2025 packs a dual-cell battery with rated capacities of 1,090mAh and 3,185mAh, totaling at least 4,275mAh.

<p>The next-gen Razr Plus may keep the 2024 model’s design, but Motorola is clearly making some big moves under the hood.</p>

<p>The new battery marks a big jump from the previous model’s 4,000mAh. Plus, Anvin reports 68W fast charging, a notable upgrade from the current 45W on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>.</p><p>Beyond the bigger battery, the Razr Plus 2025 is set to keep the same 6.9-inch inner foldable screen and 4-inch pOLED cover display. It’s also expected to pack dual 50MP rear cameras, a 50MP selfie snapper, and a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, with up to 18GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.</p>
<h2 id="standard-razr-shrinks-and-switches-the-processor-2">Standard Razr shrinks and switches the processor</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the regular Motorola Razr 2025 is rumored to pack the new MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chip and 12GB of RAM. In a surprising twist, a leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/motorola-razr-60-specifications-colour-options-design/" target="_blank">XpertPick </a>suggests it’ll shrink to a 6.7-inch display, down from the 6.9-inch screens used in previous models, including the 2024 Razr.</p><p>The regular model could also arrive in three colors: Pantone Gibraltar (blue), Pantone Lightest Sky (silver), and Spring Bud (green).</p><p>Motorola usually launches its Razr foldables in China first before going global, so chances are the company will stick to the same game plan this time.</p>
