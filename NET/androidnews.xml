HMD Global, the company behind Nokia-branded smartphones, is shifting its focus away from the U.S. market, leaving fans wondering what this means for the future of the Nokia brand.</p><p>HMD Global told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/705046/hmd-global-nokia-scaling-back-us-market" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that it is scaling back its presence in the U.S., which could mean no new Nokia phones will be launching stateside anytime soon. The company reiterated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-global/hmd-global-barbie-phone">existing devices will still get support</a>, meaning security updates and warranties will continue as promised.</p><p>The company is calling it “scaling back,” but it looks more like it's fully stepping away from selling phones in the U.S. It’s a quiet exit from a market HMD never quite managed to crack.</p><p>As it stands, all buy buttons are gone from HMD's product pages. You might still spot a few Nokia phones on places like Amazon, but those are probably just leftover inventories, and once they're gone, that’s likely it.</p><h2 id="tariffs-took-a-toll-2">Tariffs took a toll</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="ghtTu477BqoshoXmRuGhUa" name="Nokia-C1-Plus-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Nokia C1 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ghtTu477BqoshoXmRuGhUa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1535" height="863" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nokia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>HMD blames its U.S. retreat on geopolitical and economic challenges, which is basically a polite way of saying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/trumps-tariff-threat-now-targets-samsung-and-your-favorite-smartphones">U.S. tariffs made things too expensive to be worth it</a>. Higher costs, thinner profits, and the market just wasn’t working in its favor.</p><p>The U.S. smartphone market is a tough battleground, dominated by big players like Apple and Samsung. HMD struggled to gain traction with carriers and consumers, despite Nokia’s nostalgic appeal. Meanwhile, the company may be refocusing on markets where budget and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a> sell better.</p><p>Last year, it began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nokia-no-more-hmd-global-shifts-gears">moving away from the Nokia brand</a> to focus on creating original devices and building new partnerships.</p><p>To be clear, HMD is not closing shop. Right now, it is focused on making sure the exit doesn’t leave customers or partners hanging. Warranties, support, and service are still on the table, backed by its global teams.</p><p>HMD took over Nokia’s feature phone business from Microsoft back in 2016, after Microsoft had its own go at reviving the brand in 2014. At the same time, HMD scored a deal to use the Nokia name on budget and mid-range phones and tablets. That licensing deal runs until March 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Pixel devices are eligible for running the latest Canary build, and new notable features have already started popping up.</p><p>The search giant is likely bringing an all-new "Parental controls" setting under the Digital Wellbeing preferences on Pixel phones, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-canary-parental-controls-3576563/">Android Authority</a>. It appeared on a Pixel 8 Pro (per the shared screenshot by the publication) in the recent Canary build with a description indicating it features "Digital ground rules & screen time limits."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="ZT8gDEJjVSUHThFNH5L754" name="Parental-controls-Android-Canary-build.jpeg" alt="New Parental Controls in latest Android Canary" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZT8gDEJjVSUHThFNH5L754.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the publication notes that the spotted feature doesn't do anything when tapped, which is understandable since it is in a Canary build. However, it is believed to resemble the "Supervision" tools spotted in the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-drops-android-16-beta-4-before-the-big-stable-launch-in-may">Android 16 Beta 4</a>, which comprised device supervision toggles and web content filtering.</p><p>Enabling the feature would help parents block explicit sites on browsers like Chrome and filter content on Google Search. With the new findings in the Canary build, it showcases Google's intent in enhancing protection for kids with the inclusion of supposedly robust controls as part of digital well-being, and we expect to see more of it in the upcoming releases, probably after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> series, which are set to launch sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id="coming-with-the-pixel-10-launch-2">Coming with the Pixel 10 launch?</h2><p>Pixel 10 models are anticipated to have an early launch, which is on August 20, following a similar approach from last year's models. And like last year, we are expecting it to comprise the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the foldable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>. All these devices are also anticipated to ship with stable Android 16 out of the box.</p><p>And, with the new setting spotted in beta, we expect more robust controls coming to Pixel phones by the time of their launch.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

But whatever your tastes, upgraded specs and new Samsung Health features should matter just as much as design.</p><p>Here's the gist, if you're in a hurry: Galaxy Watch 7 owners have only one tentative reason to upgrade, but with a Galaxy Watch 6 (Classic) or older, you should be seriously tempted.</p><h2 id="the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-isn-t-as-different-as-it-looks-2">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 isn't as different as it looks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="e2XQUEGeVYWuj3GdMkZRJG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2XQUEGeVYWuj3GdMkZRJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 8 vs. 7</a>, it's immediately apparent how similar they are. They share the 3nm Exynos W1000 chip, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, dual-band GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity standards, and the latest BioActive Sensor suite with extra HR LEDs.</p><p>If you're switching from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Watch 6 to the Watch 8</a>, however, you do get a faster, more battery-efficient processor, dual-band GPS, more accurate health sensors with more data, faster charging, and doubled storage. Slightly more tempting, right?</p><p>Samsung slightly switched up its display sizes with the Watch 8: It measures 1.34 and 1.47 inches instead of 1.3 and 1.5, with a 326 pixels-per-inch ratio that's right in the usual ballpark. I doubt most people will notice that the display is different from previous years, aside from the extra brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-11" alt="The Galaxy Watch 8 (left) and Watch 8 Classic (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 8 (<em>left</em>) and Watch 8 Classic (<em>right</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is 1.1mm skinnier than the Watch 7, or 2mm thinner than the Watch 8 Classic.

Samsung superfans might dislike it, but since this squircle redesign is probably here to stay, you may want to try it out and see if you like it in person.</p><p>My colleague Andrew prefers the Watch 8 Classic look more and doesn't mind heavier watches, but he admitted that the Watch 8 is light enough to "forget" you're wearing it. With the default band attached, the Watch 8 40mm and 44mm will only weigh about 52–56g, very reasonable and comfortable for a smartwatch.</p><h2 id="no-other-smartwatch-looks-like-the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-except-the-ultra-2">No other smartwatch looks like the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (except the Ultra)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dWtbcgRrNYoq22gE4hH4vZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in a top-down view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dWtbcgRrNYoq22gE4hH4vZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Galaxy Watch 6 Classic owners may feel conflicted about the Watch 8 Classic look, because the Ultra chic runs directly counter to the idea of a "classic" smartwatch design.

In practice, both my Watch 8 Classic 46mm and Watch 6 Classic 47mm weigh 86g or 3oz. And the newer model is 0.3mm thinner, though you can barely tell the difference in person.</p><p>The bulk <em>does</em> have an impact, because Samsung gave its Watch 8 Classic a smaller 1.34-inch display; there's no 1.5-inch option this time because (presumably) it would be <em>way</em> too heavy. You'll have to accept that visual downgrade, though you get an extra 1,000 nits of brightness, the Quick Button, 64GB of storage, and the other Watch 8 upgrades as consolation.</p><p>It's clear that Samsung made the Classic a more affordable spin-off of the Ultra, without the benefit of an extra day of battery life. It's too heavy for casual smartwatch fans, but those willing to wear a heavier watch might want the Ultra, or a cheaper, long-lasting option like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, long-time Classic fans will have to accept these changes for the rotating bezel, which feels just as seamless and natural to use as it did with the Watch 6 Classic.</p><h2 id="your-watch-8-upgrade-decision-will-come-down-to-samsung-health-2">Your Watch 8 upgrade decision will come down to Samsung Health </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results with Samsung Health on Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 launches with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> running One UI 8 Watch, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/samsung-announces-one-ui-8-watch-beta-program">major new health metrics</a>: carotene levels for your Antioxidant Index, heart health with Vascular Load, personalized training plans with Running Coach, and circadian rhythm for Bedtime Guidance.</p><p>I assumed that because the Watch 8 and 7 share the same health sensor suite, the Watch 7 would track all of this data once it got the update in a few months.

As with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it feels like Samsung has something to prove with the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and its bold yet familiar design shows us that it does listen to consumers… at least somewhat.</p><p>There's certainly a lot to like about the Galaxy Z Flip 7, but there are some big question marks. This includes the move to another chipset despite Samsung's other phones this year using the latest from Qualcomm, as well as Samsung's insistence on not following Motorola's footsteps with regard to exactly how that newly expanded cover screen is handled.</p><p>So, should you buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>? Should you opt for the cheaper Galaxy Z Flip FE or maybe even last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>?

This is thanks in part to a redesigned hinge, which is thinner and more durable. In fact, Samsung says the Z Flip 7 is 1.1mm thinner than the Galaxy S23 when unfolded.

However, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 still doesn't let you use apps on the cover screen out of the box.

The Razr Ultra 2025, for example, doesn't seem to hit awe-inspiring benchmarking numbers compared to other 8 Elite devices, despite the phone performing very well in daily use. The compact Z Flip 7 may not require all that power, and Samsung may be more interested in efficiency than anything else.</p><p>I should note that I don't put much stock in benchmarking and instead rely solely on my experience using devices. The Razr Ultra 2025 can handle just about anything I throw at it, but I can't help but wonder if all that power is why Motorola stuffed a 4,700mAh battery into it. Meanwhile, Samsung seems content with a 4,300mAh battery for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and given the difference in how these two chips are configured, I imagine Samsung is able to etch out more battery life with less.</p><p>Of course, time will tell how the chip will perform, and you'll have to wait for our review for more details.</p><h2 id="verdict-2">Verdict</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in Blue Shadow hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 feels like a huge step in the right direction for Samsung. The improved design and larger cover screen make this a much more competitive flip phone, which should make Motorola nervous. That said, the jury is still out on whether the Exynos 2500 will shine or fall flat when compared to the competition.</p><p>The cheaper pricetag is something the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has over the Razr Ultra 2025. You can get it in a lower storage configuration than what Motorola offers, saving you about $200. Even at 512GB, it's still cheaper than Motorola's flagship, although that's with less RAM.</p><p>Overall, I think that anyone interested in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 should consider buying one.

Let's explore the significant changes in Android since Google's acquisition, focusing on the evolving relationship between devices and consumer demands, the inexorable rise of larger screens, and the groundbreaking advent of foldable phone technology.</p><h2 id="the-genesis-and-early-days-2005-2014-how-it-all-started-2">The genesis and early days (2005-2014): How it all started</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:965px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3MRppqfw3vkjXaFVqWbetm" name="t-mobile-g1-proper-landscape.JPG" alt="T-Mobile G1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MRppqfw3vkjXaFVqWbetm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="965" height="543" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The story of modern Android truly begins in July 2005, when Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/google-buys-android/" target="_blank">quietly acquired Android Inc</a>., a small startup founded by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White. July 11, 2005, is regarded by many as the official date when the Android team relocated to the Google campus and became part of the Google team.</p><p>Initially, Android Inc. was developing an operating system for digital cameras, but Google quickly pivoted its focus towards the burgeoning smartphone market, recognizing the immense potential. This acquisition laid the foundation for Google's entry into mobile software, setting the stage for a revolution.</p><p>The first commercially available Android device, the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1), launched in October 2008. At this time, smartphones were still a niche, dominated by BlackBerry. Early Android phones were characterized by physical keyboards, small resistive touchscreens (typically around 3.2 inches), and a focus on basic internet browsing, email, and communication. Consumer needs were relatively simple: a reliable device for calls, texts, some basic web access, and a handful of apps.</p><p>Android's open-source nature quickly attracted developers, leading to a rapid expansion of the app ecosystem. By the early 2010s, Android had begun its meteoric rise, with devices like the Motorola Droid and Samsung Galaxy S series pushing touchscreen-only designs and incrementally larger displays (around 4-5 inches), signing the death certificate for physical keyboards.</p><h2 id="growing-pains-2015-2017-refinement-and-the-rise-of-the-big-screen-2">Growing pains (2015-2017): Refinement and the rise of the big screen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qsuQSb7ouMb2R6KiKUSYFR" name="htc-one-nexus-4-04.jpg" alt="LG Nexus 4 versus HTC One." src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsuQSb7ouMb2R6KiKUSYFR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>By 2015, Android was a <em>mostly</em> mature and dominant platform, having surpassed its competitors in market share. Devices were becoming sleeker, and screen sizes had settled into a comfortable range, typically between 5 and 5.5 inches. The "phablet" category, once a novelty, was starting to influence mainstream design, with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-6p-specs">Nexus 6P</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-review">Galaxy Note</a> series pushing the upper limits. Consumer needs at this time revolved around reliable app performance, improved battery life, and access to a rapidly expanding and increasingly sophisticated app ecosystem for communication, social media, entertainment, and basic productivity.</p><p>Android's strength continued to be its open-source nature, fostering diverse hardware options from numerous manufacturers, which in turn catered to a wide range of budgets and preferences.</p><p>This period saw the solidification of core Android features, the refinement of Material Design for a more cohesive user interface, and significant improvements in camera technology. As users consumed more media, played more graphically intensive games, and engaged with more complex apps, the desire for slightly larger and more vibrant viewing areas began to subtly emerge, pushing screen sizes incrementally upwards and setting the stage for the next wave of innovation.</p><h2 id="the-era-of-edge-to-edge-displays-2018-2020-maximizing-screen-real-estate-2">The era of edge-to-edge displays (2018-2020): Maximizing screen real estate</h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="F6G2N7CAH334QDScAfamr4" name="google-pixel-3-xl-white-4.jpg" alt="Pixel 3 XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F6G2N7CAH334QDScAfamr4.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The years between 2018 and 2020 marked a pivotal shift towards truly expansive, edge-to-edge screens. Manufacturers, driven by consumer demand for more immersive content consumption and enhanced multitasking capabilities, began to minimize bezels aggressively. Innovations like the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-notch-add-screen-space-or-take-it-away">notch</a>," "punch-hole," and later under-display camera designs became common, pushing displays closer to the very edges of the device.</p><p>Screens grew significantly, with 6-inch and even 6.5-inch displays becoming standard, often in taller, narrower aspect ratios that made them more comfortable to hold despite their increased diagonal size.</p><p>Consumer needs evolved beyond basic functionality. Users now expected powerful multi-lens cameras capable of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/computational-photography">computational photography</a>, robust performance for demanding games and applications, and intelligent features powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> (although AI didn't quite mean what it means today).</p><p>Android responded with improvements in camera APIs, enhanced notification management, and deeper integration of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>. The larger, more immersive screens facilitated better split-screen multitasking and provided a superior canvas for media, gaming, and productivity apps, cementing the idea that a bigger display offered a more premium and functional experience.</p><p>This period also saw a greater emphasis on software updates, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-important-are-android-security-patches">security patches</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-privacy-location-data-collection">privacy controls</a>, as smartphones became increasingly central to users' personal and professional lives.</p><h2 id="the-foldable-frontier-2021-present-a-new-form-factor-2">The foldable frontier (2021-Present): A new form factor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PTZZY2kKG6QR9StcMURpS7" name="podcast-addict-android-central-podcast-z-fold-3-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Podcast Addict app playing Android Central podcast on a Galaxy Z Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTZZY2kKG6QR9StcMURpS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most radical change in Android's recent history has been the introduction and maturation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, beginning around 2019 but gaining significant traction and refinement from 2021 onwards. Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dont-want-to-spend-usd2k-on-the-fold-7-get-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-for-almost-40-percent-off-instead">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Z Flip</a> series, along with offerings from other manufacturers such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google's Pixel Fold</a>, shattered the traditional smartphone form factor. These devices directly addressed the desire for even larger screen real estate, offering a tablet-sized display when unfolded, while maintaining a pocketable form factor when closed.</p><p>This innovation necessitated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-is-google-getting-serious-about-foldables">significant adaptations within Android itself</a>. Google introduced specific optimizations for large screens, improved app continuity (seamless transitions between folded and unfolded states), and enhanced multitasking features tailored for the expansive inner displays, including better drag-and-drop and multi-window support. Consumer needs now include not just a large screen, but a versatile screen that can adapt to different use cases – from a compact phone to a mini-tablet, and even a laptop-like experience with external accessories.</p><p>Beyond foldables, the trend of large screens continued in traditional slab phones, with premium models routinely sporting displays well over 6.7 inches, often with high refresh rates for smoother scrolling and animations. Privacy and security have also become paramount consumer concerns, leading to more granular permission controls and transparency features within Android.</p><p>The platform continues to evolve, focusing on seamless connectivity, deeper integration with other devices (like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables">wearables</a> and smart home devices), and a more personalized, intelligent user experience, all while pushing the boundaries of hardware innovation with the foldable form factor leading the charge.</p><h2 id="evolving-android-2">Evolving Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iowDZd4ev9eQV6gdinVrbK" name="Android" alt="The Android sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iowDZd4ev9eQV6gdinVrbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4146" height="2332" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since Google's foresightful acquisition of Android Inc. in 2005, the Android ecosystem has undergone a remarkable and ongoing transformation.

The summer Galaxy Unpacked event brought the Galaxy Z Flip 7, Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip FE, and the Galaxy Watch 8 series. And that's not all, on the software front, these devices come packed with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/one-ui">One UI</a> 8, backed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a>. This means new Galaxy AI features debut on these devices along with Wear OS 6 quirks.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Z Fold 7</strong></p><p>Samsung is flexing its muscles with its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which arrives as the thinnest and almost creaseless foldable device yet. Measuring 8.9mm when folded and 4.2mm when unfolded while maintaining a 4,400mAh battery.</p><p>The Z Fold 7 arrives with a much wider 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X cover display, which Samsung says features a 21:9 aspect ratio, and an 8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen that achieves 2,600 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Samsung's new foldable is powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>, and gets the Galaxy Z series' first 200MP (wide-angle) primary lens, along with a 12MP ultra-wide and a 10MP telephoto lens. While the cover display and internal display both have 10MP selfie shooters.</p><p>The phone comes with three different storage options and colorways, with preorders now live, starting at $1,999 in Blue Shadow, Jet Black, and Silver Shadow.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-12" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Galaxy Z Flip 7</strong></p><p>Samsung outdid itself with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, launching with an all-new look and sporting a larger screen space than usual. To begin, it sheds its usual folder-like cover screen for the largest ever edge-to-edge external display on a Galaxy Z Flip series.</p><p>The 4.1-inch Super AMOLED FlexWindow enables users to perform more tasks directly from its cover screen when the device is closed. The Flip 7 gets a larger 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen and a 120 Hz refresh rate.</p><p>This pocket-sized dynamite of a phone comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500 SoC</a> and a 4,300mAh battery, delivering "up to 31 hours of video on a single charge."</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is available in two storage configurations: 12/256GB and 12/512GB, and in three colorways: Blue Shadow, Jet Black, and Coral Red. The Mint is reserved for online purchases only.</p><p>Preorders begin today, and it is set to hit stores on July 25, starting at $1,099.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Z Flip FE</strong></p><p>It looks like the Z Flip 6; it feels like the Z Flip 6... but it's the new Z Flip 7 Fan Edition. The device arrived at a lower price and with a different processor — aka the Exynos 2400.</p><p>This device features a smaller 3.4-inch cover display and a larger 6.7-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X main display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It has a 50MP main camera and a 12MP ultrawide, along with a 10MP selfie camera. Other than that, it comes packed with new Galaxy AI features and is available for $899 in black and white.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Galaxy Watch 8 series</strong></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">The Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic</a> are built upon the Watch Ultra aesthetic.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic arrives in a single 46mm (1.34-inch display) case and sports a "slimmer, brighter Classic screen." The Classic weighs about 63.5 grams and has a Sapphire Crystal display, making consumers' viewing experience much better.</p><p>With an ultra-like squaricle dial, Watch 8 Classic brings back the physical rotating bezel, making scrolling through your apps a breeze. The smartwatch gets a new "Quick Button" for "added convenience." The smartwatch arrives with a 445mAh battery, 2GB of memory, and 64GB of storage.</p><p>As for the standard Galaxy Watch 8, Samsung claims it features the thinnest build yet, approximately 11% thinner than previous models, and includes a "Dynamic Lug" system for enhanced comfort and fit. It comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes with 1.34-inch and 1.47-inch Super AMOLED displays, respectively. Brightness is increased by 50% to 3,000 nits. Design-wise, it features a cushion design inspired by the Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><h2 id="pixel-10-prototype-leaks-on-a-chinese-auction-site-2">Pixel 10 prototype leaks on a Chinese auction site</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-alleged-prototype-surfaces-chinese-auction-site-spotted"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Google Pixel 10 leaks have been coming in hot, with a Pixel 10 prototype model showing up on a Chinese <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goofish.com/item?spm=a21ybx.item.itemCnxh.26.301a3da6AshFjk&id=934114703133&categoryId=0" target="_blank">auction website</a>. The machine-translated description box indicates that the seller is offering the motherboard of the Pixel device, which resembles what we've seen in past leaks. The phone features the usual rounded corners and flat edges, similar to Google's past-generation models.</p><p>The back, which further emphasizes its prototype nature, displays the "G" logo and a horizontal camera bump with an additional lens. The photo of the motherboard features a bolded "G5," which likely indicates the phone's expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor G5</a> SoC.</p><p>The Pixel 10's camera island appears to consist of three lenses and its LED flash.

Leaked renders of smartglasses show off two alleged Ray-Ban Meta styles— 'Aperol' (sunglasses) and 'Bellini' (optical) — hinting at a shift from the one-style-fits-all approach by the company.</p><p>Both models are expected to offer significantly improved battery life and advanced AI features, including object detection, scene recognition, and possibly even facial recognition. The next-gen Ray-Ban Meta glasses could also feature an always-on mode that keeps cameras and sensors running continuously, allowing the AI to provide live reminders.</p><p>While there's conflicting news about when we might see these wearables launch, the XR Research Institute thinks these models might arrive before the year’s end, but The Information says we might have to wait until 2026.</p><h2 id="garmin-just-made-google-maps-legit-on-its-watches-2">Garmin just made Google Maps legit on its watches</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5G7qCDBU9T5m5DENL79P6G" name="Garmin-google-maps-integration" alt="Google Maps comes to select Garmin watches" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5G7qCDBU9T5m5DENL79P6G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/google-maps-arrives-on-select-garmin-smartwatches-for-easy-navigation"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Garmin announced on Tuesday (July 8) that some of its smartwatches will receive Google Maps via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15427076?sid=ac-ca-1137855206656005807&url=https://apps.garmin.com/apps/f140ff7f-d19e-49f1-b851-01c7e0009d6c" target="_blank">company's Connect IQ Store</a>.

It’s a notable shift from previous models."</p><p>While the reasoning behind this decision remains unknown, it is likely due to the phone's slim form factor (measuring 8.9mm when folded and about 4.2mm unfolded), which would make it challenging to integrate an S Pen without requiring more space on the device for the accessory.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Nowadays, things have mostly calmed down, with Amazon, Apple, Google, and Roku leading the charge. Last year, Google shifted its focus, as it introduced the Google TV Streamer 4K, while also retiring the beloved Chromecast line.</p><p>Now, the Google TV Streamer sits atop the mountain in Google's ecosystem, operating as both a smart home hub and an excellent 4K streaming device.

Google thankfully rectified that with the TV Streamer, as it includes 32GB of storage. And if that isn't enough, you can connect a USB-C hub and a thumb drive to expand it even further.</p><p>There are also a few AI features on board, but they aren't really intrusive and are more novelty than anything else. However, the biggest reason why I love the TV Streamer is that it can basically turn my TV into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">massive smart display</a>.</p><p>Google integrated both Matter and a Thread Border Router into the TV Streamer, ensuring that it would be compatible with just about any smart home ecosystem. Of course, it works best when you use the Google Home app, but if you take the time to set up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-one-app-has-made-my-life-so-much-easier">Home Assistant</a>, you can connect and control all of your smart home devices right from the Google Home app.</p><p>I'm not sure what the future holds for the Google TV Streamer, but it's still performing well enough that it's not something I've even thought about.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-7">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4573639154595610853-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1212356707565852129-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9376992827335726461-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1233177422277781313-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4012941798439036658-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide.</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Each plugs into an outlet with a tiny power brick that fits anywhere, and thanks to the diminutive size, the PTZ camera also fits on any shelf or dresser.</p><p>Since it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/"><strong>just $23</strong></a> for the rest of the day today, July 11, I can grab a few more to ensure I see every nook and cranny of my home while I'm away. That's $23 out the door, no subscription needed or strings to pull, and no garbage or hassles, and no worrying about someone spying on me since I only set them up when I'm away.</p><p>If you've got any other Blink cameras, these will tie right in with them in the Blink app, letting you monitor everything from one handy dashboard. Blink cameras don't require a subscription to work, and you can even pick up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ">Blink Sync Module</a> to configure local storage on an SD card.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ffc90257-7011-43ec-9d72-4f83dc0c7612" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension48="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension25="$23.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="uApUTnYB7nq2dT8wwMyFid" name="blink-mini-pan-tilt-official-product-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uApUTnYB7nq2dT8wwMyFid.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>There's no getting around it. For the price, it's nearly impossible to argue with what Blink offers. Great camera quality, a wider range of movement than Ring, a quick 360-degree pan button to scope out the whole room, and the ability to store footage locally or in the cloud. </p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/blink-ptz-vs-ring-ptz-cameras-which-amazon-brand-should-see-your-home" data-dimension112="ffc90257-7011-43ec-9d72-4f83dc0c7612" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension48="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension25="$23.99"><strong>Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison </strong></a>📷</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for an amazing indoor PTZ camera that has a full 360-degree range of movement, 135-degree tilt range, motion detection, and even a two-way speaker so you can hear what's going on in your house and speak to whoever is there, invited or not!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a camera with 4K resolution, AI-powered object detection, or something more advanced. This camera does a lot, but more expensive models will get you more options.</p><p><strong>Alternative deal ⭐:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/"><strong>Ring Pan-Tilt camera - </strong><del>$79.99</del><strong> $39.99 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ffc90257-7011-43ec-9d72-4f83dc0c7612" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension48="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension25="$23.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>As I've said in the past, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/never-ever-put-a-camera-inside-your-home">I never recommend</a> leaving cameras set up in your home while you're in it. It's a horrible security risk if anyone ever gains access to your account, but these cameras are so small and so easy to set up that it's never a hassle to pull them out when I want to use them.</p><p>It's worth noting that this camera is only designed for indoor use. It's not weather-rated at all, so it's definitely going to break if it gets soaked in a rainstorm or baked in the summer heat. Blink sells other cameras that are made for outdoor use. I actually have several of them in my chicken coop, and they do a great job of monitoring the temperature there and in the outdoor rabbit hutch we have.</p><p>Overall, I love Blink and use it for almost all my smart home cameras. It's especially handy that I can keep the footage on local SD cards and not have to pay for cloud storage, although that option is great for people who would rather skip the hassle of dealing with swapping out SD cards or changing video sources.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

If the wall adapter plugging into your outlet doesn't support a fast charging speed, nothing else matters.

This isn't some back alley deal, it's just the best smartphone deal you'll find today since it's so darn cheap. And yeah, I have four of them. Don't judge me.</p><p>The Nuu N20 is a surprisingly capable phone that'll do all the basics and then some. It's a great choice for your kid's first phone, a vacation phone (so you don't have to worry about something more expensive getting stolen), or even just as a backup device to keep in a drawer.</p><p>This one ramped up in price in May because of the lovely tariff situation in the U.S. but it's back down to pre-tariff pricing until the end of the day today, Friday, July 11.

This one doesn't look or feel cheap, despite what you might assume!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you have no interest in a cheap backup phone.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/NUU-T-Mobile-Teenagers-Octa-Core-Unlocked/dp/B0DLG4WKKG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="cb6b0bc0-78b0-459c-9174-4a1c21d75fa9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Coral" data-dimension48="Coral" data-dimension25="$109">View Deal</a></p></div><p>As you might imagine, the Nuu N20 isn't going to win any awards for best display, camera, or processing speed. But what it will win is the best Prime Day value award, because it gives you a full-fledged Android 14-powered experience without all the fluff that comes with other devices.</p><p>Nuu is based in Miami, Florida, and does an excellent job crafting a stock-like Android experience without the bloat or preinstalled nonsense that some other budget brands fill their phones with.</p><p>This one's got 6GB of RAM, which is 50% more than any Motorola phone at this price range, and the 90Hz display feels smoother than even the $1,000 iPhones. No, I'm dead serious there. The non-Pro iPhones use a paltry 60Hz screen, which feels just plain awful in 2025. Meanwhile, this $109 phone eclipses half of Apple's recent lineup in this one area. It's pretty wild.</p><p>Nuu also advertises that the N20 works perfectly with any parental control app, so you can keep your kids safe online. I personally use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bark.us/">Bark parental controls</a> for my son and love how it can catch even bad images that might appear on your child's phone, thanks to the "wonders" of the internet. Whatever you do with it, though, make sure you buy it before midnight tonight, otherwise this deal is gone.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While Nintendo doesn't sell an OLED-equipped model yet, you can get an OLED on the go when using a pair of smart glasses, but you'll need this clever battery pack to get the job done.</p><p>Thankfully, the Viture Pro Mobile Dock is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW"><strong>on sale for $98.10</strong></a> on the last day of Prime Day, which ends Friday, July 11. This 10,000mAh battery pack has a set of special USB-C ports that trick the Switch 2 into thinking it's docked to a TV, unlocking the full power of the system and making it possible to play it on a pair of OLED-equipped smart glasses. Not only that, but this supports <em>two</em> smart glasses at a time, so you and someone else can play at the same time with a giant virtual OLED.</p><p>See, with most handheld systems, you can just plug smart glasses into the USB-C port and your system thinks it's docked, but not the Switch 2. Nintendo locked down the USB-C port on this system just as with the original Switch, but Viture cleverly designed the Mobile Dock to work with Nintendo's security, making this the <em>only </em>way to play on a Switch 2 with smart glasses.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vitures-new-luma-glasses-are-incredible-and-this-viture-prime-day-sale-is-impossible-to-resist"><strong>Viture's new Luma glasses are incredible, and this Viture Prime Day sale is impossible to resist</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="03daf6d7-3403-4322-88d2-8268e68c337a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central review" data-dimension48="Android Central review" data-dimension25="$98.10" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HWLY3T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1425px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tUS3fEEJW9kcgoeZyj8NwR" name="viture-pro-mobile-dock-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tUS3fEEJW9kcgoeZyj8NwR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1425" height="1425" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Be sure to clip the </em><em><strong>10% off coupon</strong></em><em> on Amazon's page before checking out to get the full discount.</em></p><p>Plug the Viture Pro Mobile Dock into your Switch 2 and enjoy docked performance and quality on the go.

A departure from traditional open-ear designs, they look as much like jewelry as they do consumer technology, so much so that I’m considering buying some earcuffs now. But these earlobe adornments are so much more than just fashionable; they are highly functional.<em>" — Tshaka Armstrong for Android Central</em></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review"><strong>Android Central review</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2</a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you find in-ear headphones to be uncomfortable; you want a simple, fashionable pair of open earbuds with a great case; you need high-quality sound. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you love bass, because open earbuds don't excel in low-end reproduction; you need the longest battery life. </p><p><strong>Price check 💵: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/dp/B0CPFV77W4/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">$229 at Amazon </a>| <a href="https://www.bose.com/p/earbuds/bose-ultra-open-earbuds/ULT-HEADPHONEOPN.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">$229 at Bose</a></p><p><strong>Alternative deal 🪙: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Open-Ear-Headphones-Technology-Compatible/dp/B0DGLL5CWK/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Nothing Ear Open - </strong><del>$189</del><strong> $99 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/bose-ultra-open-ear-true-wireless-open-earbuds-lunar-blue/6593186.p?skuId=6593186" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="df2c76ad-756e-4903-9cc4-83a09fa81500" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was:  $299.00" data-dimension48="Was:  $299.00" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Oddly enough, I got my start with open earbuds by trying the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-accessories-under-usd25">which unfortunately aren't on sale for Prime Day</a>. Trying out these glasses, and their embedded speakers, showed me how freeing it is to listen to music on-the-go without clogging up your ears. Enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds" target="_blank">the best open-earbuds</a>, designed to provide a personal listening experience without the hassle.</p><p>Why might you want a pair of open earbuds? This style of audio gear might make sense if you're someone that has a hard time finding ear tips and buds that fit perfectly. Since the Bose Ultra Open earbuds sit outside your ear canal, this isn't a problem at all. They gently rest outside your ear canal while subtly clipping onto your earlobe for comfort and security.</p><p>The open design means you can also let ambient noise in, which can be desirable in a few kinds of situations. Maybe you're a runner or cyclist who needs to hear the world around you for a safe workout. Or, perhaps you work at a jobsite or office where it's necessary to hear what's going on nearby.</p><p>There are a few tradeoffs — without passive isolation, bass reproduction won't be at its best and you might need to crank the volume up in noisy environments. But for the right person, these are small sacrifices that become worthwhile to get the perfect fit. At the right price — under $200 at Best Buy for a limited time — the Bose Ultra Open earbuds are an excellent buy.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-32">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1247058908279972596-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE July 8-11: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1710879167675793923-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2723093340651576047-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1324054839394922680-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1144969634142208516-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Rumors suggest we might see one pretty soon.</p><p>A render of a fancy-looking Motorola Razr was posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-motorola-razr-swarovski-edition-is-launching-soon-first-look/">YTECHB</a> today (July 11), suggesting an incoming collaboration edition (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_is_working_on_a_blingedup_razr-news-68590.php">GSMArena</a>). The publication claims Motorola is preparing to bring a fancy new "crystal-studded" Razr 2025 foldable edition. From the rendering, the device looks mostly the same, save for the small crystals (kind of like diamonds) popped into its form factor.</p><p>On the cover display, there are supposedly three crystals implanted near the hinge, just above the screen. The back of the device is where the design is reportedly going to shine the most. It seems Motorola will implant crystal studs into a (seemingly) soft fabric material, which looks almost like a fancified purse.</p><p>Prominent X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1943538675964342466">Evan Blass</a> got in on things, stating this phone is looking at a debut on August 5; however, we might know who it's with. The tipster's post and the publication both claim Motorola is looking at Swarovski, a jewelry company, to bedazzle its foldable.</p><p>Moreover, it seems this collaboration edition will only concern the base Razr 2025 foldable. The rendering doubles down on this, furthered by the thicker border between the cover display and the hinge. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra</a> offers a slightly larger display (4-inch), so the border is much thinner on it.</p><h2 id="motorola-and-its-collabs-special-editions-2">Motorola and its collabs/special editions</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:591px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.49%;"><img id="7dpZ2q5aERYqm45FBGiMs8" name="motorola-razr-2025-swarovski-render-leak" alt="A leaked render of the Motorola Razr 2025 with a light blue color scheme for its rumored Swarovski jewelry collaboration." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7dpZ2q5aERYqm45FBGiMs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="591" height="588" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YTECHB)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The name Swarovski might sound familiar, and that's because Motorola collaborated with them once before (or you like their jewelry). Earlier this year, when the Razr 2025 series debuted, Motorola launched its first-ever open-earbuds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">the Buds Loop</a>. These buds are offered with 12mm drivers for rich sound, and they come in the following colors: Pantone-curated Trekking Green and a dazzling Pantone-curated French Oak.</p><p>However, there was a third option: a crystal-encrusted version, thanks to Swarovski. These buds are lighter in color, and the crystals are present along the band that connects the two halves of the device for each ear. It seems Motorola was pleased with the first round, so it's looking into the collaboration again for its foldable phone.</p><p>Motorola has always been one for unique collaborations and special editions. Back in February, the company launched a special edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-paris-pink-limited-edition-launch">Razr Plus 2024 with Paris Hilton</a>. The device was offered in a new Paris Pink with a vegan leather finish, as well as two wrist straps in Pink Sparkle and Pink Vegan Leather. Consumers could also grab a vegan leather case that continues the Paris Pink trend with her signature and iconic phrase, "That's Hot."</p><p>On a more subtle note, the Razr Plus 2024 also received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-2024-razr-plus-pantone-rich-mocha-shade">a Mocha Mousse color</a> from Pantone late last year.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Of course, immediately facing a lot of people is the main Android OS: Android 16. While Google has fast-tracked Android 16, moving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">into the "Trunk Stable" process</a> for quicker development cycles, Samat says the software's goal remains letting users "fit the ethos of what’s on your home screen with the rest of your phone."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is a noteworthy upgrade; however, Samat states the goal was to create an OS that felt “modern and delightful” without disrupting your muscle memory.</p><p>While Samat feels confident in his work at Google with Android, stating, “I think you see the future first on Android," there's more to do. Specifically, Samat is concerned about bridging the gap between iOS and Android for users who <em>want </em>to switch. Samat says, "...this should be simple. It's 2025." Currently, there's an issue when switching platforms, and risks.</p><p>Samat is interested in utilizing in using more modern "industry standards to move data between the two, and that is a lot of what we’re advocating for and pushing for."</p><p>Google is leaning into its large design changes in Android 16 (and likely the future) when it comes to statements like seeing the "future first" on the software. Android 16 adds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>, which largely changes animations, colors, and more.</p><h2 id="gemini-takes-center-stage-2">Gemini takes center stage</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum" name="Gemini-Era-Google.jpg" alt="The Gemini Era graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthering Android's future are plans to merge "ChromeOS and Android into a single platform." Samat teased that there's a strong curiosity behind understanding how users (such as those on iOS) are using their phones with their laptops.</p><p>TechRadar and Samat's discussions boiled down into another key Android area: Gemini. Per Samat, "...Gemini integrated in a phone really provides a much more helpful experience." The AI is a part of Google's plans for Android, and its assistance will likely only continue to progress and evolve. In their interview, Samat showed off Gemini's ability to summarize a YouTube video, equipped with timestamps for fact-checking.</p><p>The publication called it a "powerful demonstration," partly due to Apple's lack of such capabilities with its Intelligence/Siri software.</p><p>Samat praises Google's AI once more, highlighting its ease of use for consumers.

Android 16 also streamlined notifications, making it easier for alerts belonging to the same app to be displayed without overwhelming (or cluttering) your device.</p><p>Additionally, the OS added Advanced Protection software, a feature that better protects a user's phones from unsafe websites and "most sophisticated attacks."</p><p>Google has also been working with other OEMs like Samsung and OnePlus to help flesh out their features for Android 16 for a more cohesive OS.

You can find headphones that offer a better sound, but you're going to pay a lot of money for a relatively small gain in quality. In fact, these rank as one of my favorites, along with "budget" picks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E/ref=sr_1_9?th=1" target="_blank">from Sony</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-XS-Headphones-Audiophiles-Studio-Black/dp/B09PH1N67T/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank">Hifiman</a>. They sound a lot better than their price tag would indicate.</p><p>The perfect pair of headphones doesn't exist, but if it did, they would inflect nothing of their own into your music; reproducing it exactly as it comes from the source. With a THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) of less than 0.1% these come really close. Close enough that you probably wouldn't notice it at all.</p><p>Open-back headphones offer a unique experience, but come with drawbacks. If you are the type who carries around a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">portable headphone amp</a> for your phone, don't use these while out and about unless you want everyone to "enjoy" whatever you're listening to. Outside of that, open-back cans offer a wonderful sound stage and almost sound like you're listening at a concert instead of a chair.</p><p>Big over-ear headphones with wires aren't for everyone, and I get it. You should use whatever you love when you want to enjoy your music. If you really like what you hear from a good set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">wireless earbuds</a>, save your $100 and put it towards the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds Pro</a> model.</p><p>If you want to try something different, know you want something better, or are just curious, you'll be hard pressed to find a cheaper way to get started down the wonderfully frustrating and expensive path of the audiophile.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-47">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Arc Pulse case series says "you don't need all that nonsense," but usually doesn't give you a price break for its lack of materials. Thankfully, Prime Day changes that with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Arc-Pulse-Compatible-Minimalist-Protective/dp/B0FBMDPGW7/"><strong>rare 20% discount</strong></a> on what are otherwise pretty expensive phone cases.</p><p>Arc Pulse works by covering the area of your phone that most commonly come in contact with the ground when it's dropped. That's the top and bottom edges, as well as all four corners. It's even got protective lips around the front edge of the display, but the rest of the phone is totally exposed for the whole world to see.</p><p>Arc Pulse cases are often limited-run items. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-arc-pulse-case-impressions">Pixel 9 Arc Pulse case</a> can no longer be found on Amazon, even though the manufacturer sells them in limited quantities on its website.

For the test, I dropped the phone on three different flooring types: a wood floor, an area rug placed on concrete, and bare concrete. I dropped it at pocket height, roughly 3ft, and at head height, roughly 6ft, to simulate the two most common ways someone might drop their phone. To my surprise, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL was spotless after all these drops.

Over the years, I've slowly stopped wearing smart watches during the day and typically only wear them for working out, hiking, or other outdoor activities. Turns out, the Instinct 2X Solar was <em>made</em> for this kind of use and beyond, as its <strong>40-day battery life</strong> was a staggering improvement over my previous favorite Wear OS watches.</p><p>The Instinct 2X Solar has a dope solar panel on top, which can not only measure the UV intensity (letting you know when to put more sun coverage on), but it also charges the super bright flashlight built into the side. If that's not enough, its ability to understand which muscles you're working out while on the go feels like pure magic, and it will help you better log and train for specific fitness improvement.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ff418896-5e1d-4275-a82a-0a7040186f29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension48="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability-Multi-Band/dp/B0BW34M77J/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="v7uqQbSmikoXGmg4i53mS" name="Garmin Instinct 2x Solar" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v7uqQbSmikoXGmg4i53mS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability-Multi-Band/dp/B0BW34M77J/" data-dimension112="ff418896-5e1d-4275-a82a-0a7040186f29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension48="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$449.99</del><strong> $299.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>Price check 💵: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-smartwatch-50-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-gray-2023/6541150.p?skuId=6541150"><strong>$299 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>"I loved the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar when I reviewed it last year, but what a difference a year makes!

I sprained my ankle last week so I've been doing more upper-body stuff this week to give me ankle a rest (plus a lot less cardio since, you know, it hurts to use the ankle). All I did was set my Garmin Instinct 2X Solar to a HIIT workout and click the "go" button. It magically figured out what I was working out, all without me needing to tell it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:110.01%;"><img id="HmBDb8wjcLctzVr2uPtKoE" name="garmin-instinct-2x-solar-hiit-workout" alt="A HIIT workout with muscle usage as measured by a Garmin Instinct 2X Solar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmBDb8wjcLctzVr2uPtKoE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="2253" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Amazfit Balance 2 I've been using can do something similar, but it usually only assigns muscle usage based on specific workout types. For instance, I used it to log "strength training" and it was able to figure out that I was doing deadlifts, so it logged my legs as being heavily used. But selecting a HIIT workout on the Amazfit Balance 2 will only give me heart rate data, not muscle usage.</p><p>While this muscle data might seem superfluous at first, it's actually incredibly helpful for specific training. That way, you know exactly which muscles were used by each type of workout, even if you go to a CrossFit or WOD type of gym with a lot of variety. If I were in the market for another smartwatch right now, this is the deal I'd be buying today. There's absolutely no question.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Thinborne cases are sleek, svelte, and offer excellent protection thanks to the use of Aramid Fiber. Plus, since Samsung didn't include the magnetic element of Qi2.1, Thinborne picks up the slack by integrating MagSafe compatibility. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FDV764HR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="05f37a28-2b47-461e-a7b9-41a03437ee1c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Thinborne Aramid Fiber Galaxy Z Fold 7 Case:  $89.98" data-dimension48="Thinborne Aramid Fiber Galaxy Z Fold 7 Case:  $89.98" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're not really a fan of cases, or just prefer them to be ultra-thin while still offering excellent protection. Or you want a thin case that is actually compatible with MagSafe.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a phone case that protects your Fold 7 or Flip 7 from every angle, regardless of how hefty it is.</p><p>Something else to take into consideration when trying to find a case for the Fold 7 or Flip 7 is that neither offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-qi2-wireless-charging-support">full Qi2.1 support</a>. Instead, both of these phones meet the bare minimum requirements for Qi2.1 certification, but lack the internal hardware magnets. This is partially why Samsung is releasing a few of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-cases">its own</a> cases with the necessary magnetic ring built in.</p><p>I can only assume that Samsung didn't add magnets because that would potentially mean not being able to make these phones as thin as they are. And while that's definitely disappointing, having something like a Thinborne case more than makes up for it.</p><p>Nevertheless, I'm grateful that I don't have to deal with trying to get a dbrand skin aligned properly before trying to do the same with an adhesive MagSafe adapter. I can't tell you how many times I've thought that everything was lined up, only to find that the phone wouldn't charge when mounted on a MagSafe charger. Or even more annoying is trying to take off my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PopSockets-Compatible-Wireless-Charging-Wars-Long/dp/B0CZS4S32H/">MagSafe PopSocket</a>, only to pull the adapter off with it.</p><p>Thinborne solves all of those problems, while actually offering quite a bit more protection than a phone skin will. And like I mentioned above, both the Fold 7 and Flip 7 versions are on sale for 30% when using either code <strong>5ZOUHBLK</strong> or <strong>5ECY7ANJ </strong>at checkout.<strong> </strong></p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-57">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4671599217540639638-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1426801779885312155-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9718275238151007431-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1026980263717059872-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-6189443266861686266-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The thin and lightweight Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge just hit store shelves on May 30th, and yet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVL6DB5/"><strong>you can already score a record-smashing 29% discount on the phone</strong></a> if you buy it before Prime Day ends. </p><p>Deals on the S25 Edge have been few and far between since the phone was first announced, so I really didn&apos;t expect Amazon to go full throttle with the discounts right away. $100 off or something, sure, but a $315 discount? Totally bizarre for such a new device. Of course, who&apos;s complaining?

Despite the lightweight frame, the S25 Edge is still packed with a ton of flagship-level specs, such as the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 12GB of RAM, and a massive 200MP camera. The device also boasts a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a durable Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 construction, plus you get seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. </p><p>With its 3,900mAh battery, it&apos;s true that the S25 Edge may not last as long as other modern flagships, but it&apos;s a small price to pay if, like me, you want the sleekest Android phone on the market today. My only major concern with the Edge was its price, but thanks to this last-minute Prime Day deal, that&apos;s much less of a problem. </p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-x2014-quick-links-7">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

According to the post, the chip has received the codename "Aspen," it's known as "SW6100" internally for Qualcomm, and it's "testing phase." At the moment, the publication claims the chip is preparing a noticeable CPU upgrade, courtesy of a 1+4 core setup.</p><p>This core setup reportedly features one Arm Cortex-A78 alongside four Arm Cortex-A55 cores. Despite these cores being roughly a year old, speculation suggests this CPU upgrade could benefit the chip's "efficiency and performance."</p><p>Other alleged specs include the use of a TSMC node and a RAM controller upgrade. The chip will reportedly support LPDDR5X for a slight "battery life boost." There have also been whispers about a new coprocessor; however, the publication states concrete information about that hardware is still in the dark.</p><p>Rumors add that this Qualcomm chip for future Wear OS devices could debut sometime in 2026.</p><h2 id="take-a-step-back-into-2024-2">Take a step back into 2024</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5193px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MRmBQzMmweVwxvaQX2ZfQb" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-w5+-embedded-in-watch.jpg" alt="Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ on device up-close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MRmBQzMmweVwxvaQX2ZfQb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5193" height="2921" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's where things get interesting. Android Central's Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">sat down with Qualcomm's VP & GM of Wearables</a>, Dino Bekis, about the future of the company's Wear OS chips after previous disappointments. While Bekis stated the "next" chip would be more "feature-focused" for Wear OS devices, with AI and PC-like additions, it might need a little more time in the oven. Bekis mentions that Qualcomm was still working with Google to figure out its RISC-V cores.</p><p>Moreover, the company has thought about using its Oryon cores in this wearable chip (the same ones that power its flagship phone SoC), but there's no telling if this recently rumored chip is <em>that </em>chip.</p><p>These were all things talked about in 2024, and it seems we're still floating around the same bits of information. As Android Authority also speculates, this chip could be called the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 or, perhaps, something else, when it debuts.</p><p>The last chips to come from Qualcomm for wearables were the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 and W5 Plus Gen 1</a>. While they generally fixed some of the issues plaguing the Wear OS market, the chips provided a ~50% battery life boost based on a 4nm process. Considering the recent rumors, perhaps we'll see this improve to a 3nm process for the next iteration.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 has become my favorite tablet of the year, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/tablets/android-tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3/len103g0002"><strong>is now $120 off</strong></a> in a Lenovo Doorbuster deal.</p><p>When it was announced, I was already excited, seeing as it packs the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 behind a gorgeous 8.8-inch screen. It was also expected to be pretty affordable with a $499 launch price. However, the U.S. tariff situation resulted in the price being increased to $549 just days after it was released.</p><p>Since then, we've seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo/3-reasons-why-this-is-the-android-tablet-you-should-buy">Legion Tab Gen 3</a> drop as low as $449, but now, you can get it for even less.

Unlike many other premium tablets out there, Lenovo opted against using an OLED panel. This is great news for those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">who suffer from PWM</a>, such as my colleague Nick Sutrich.</p><p>While I could continue gushing about how great this tablet is, there are a couple of sticking points. The first of which is that you're stuck with one RAM and storage configuration (12GB/256GB), and there's no microSD card slot. Lenovo remedied this with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo/even-lenovo-knows-that-you-want-to-use-your-tablet-as-a-gaming-handheld">latest Y700 tablet</a>, but that has yet to see a release here in the States.</p><p>Another surprising omission is that the Legion Tab Gen 3 lacks a fingerprint scanner. When the tablet was announced, I just assumed it would be embedded in the power button. That's not the case, so you're left relying on the traditional unlock methods, and while there's Face Unlock, it's the rather basic version that adorned older and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/no-joke-this-is-the-cheap-android-phone-that-i-would-buy-right-now">cheaper phones</a>.</p><p>Despite those pitfalls, the Legion Tab Gen 3 is still my favorite tablet of the year, to this point. It's so good that I ended up picking up a second one that will be used for my various tinkering projects without needing to worry about something happening to the one I already have.

If you've found yourself in this situation more than once, I recommend picking up a pair of CMF Buds 2a from Amazon, as these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7"><strong>normally run $50 but are down to just $28</strong></a> for the final day of the 4-day Prime Day event. That sale <strong>ends today</strong>, Friday, July 11.</p><p>If you're not a fan of the overtly <em>radical</em> orange color I'm wearing in the picture above, don't worry. CMF sells these in black or white colorways, and they're the same price as the orange ones. These work just as well with Android phones as they do with iPhones, so don't worry about what phone you (or your friends) prefer.</p><p>CMF Buds 2a are from the Nothing brand, a UK company that sells design-forward products, normally at incredibly reasonable prices. These are already our favorite budget earbuds under $50, and this ridiculous Prime Day deal makes them a perfect impulse buy choice.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ca5d2fff-abe1-474f-9fe7-6017bfb8f60e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $49.99" data-dimension48="Was: $49.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLv22rJErGsQukJoobxGq9" name="CMF-Buds-2a" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLv22rJErGsQukJoobxGq9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>CMF Buds 2a 🎧</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7/" data-dimension112="ca5d2fff-abe1-474f-9fe7-6017bfb8f60e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $49.99" data-dimension48="Was: $49.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$49.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Now: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7/"><strong>$28 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>Price check 💵: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/CMF-Buds-2a-Wireless-Earbuds-Bluetooth-5-4-IP54-42-dB-ANC-12-4mm-Dynamic-Driver-for-Big-Bass-Up-to-35-5-Hours-of-Battery-Life-Orange/16550373168"><strong>$28 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p>"Honestly, the Buds 2 by itself is a fabulous choice considering it doesn't miss out on much. The buds have a glossy finish around the shell and a matte stalk, and the gesture recognition surface is decent enough. The lightweight design ensures they don't cause any fatigue even with extended use, and they're comfortable to wear; they're not bulky at all, and deliver a snug fit." — Harish Jonnalagadda for Android Central</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-cmf-buds-2-buds-2-plus-review"><strong>Android Central review</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐</a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you just need a cheap pair of earbuds with a charging case, active noise cancellation, and a unique style.

Don't let that make you think they're <em>garbage</em>, though. They're not. Harish was impressed with their quality and value, and he's an audiophile who reviews hundreds of audio products for Android Central.</p><p>CMF Buds 2a come with a charging case that has its own battery, ensuring your earbuds stay charged when they're inside the case. That case also has a wonderful fidget spinner wheel on the side that doubles as a lanyard holder, so you can keep it laced up in your pocket or bag so the case never falls out.</p><p>The buds themselves are super lightweight and comfortable, with different eartip sizes in the box and a design that looks as good as it feels.</p><p>If you're in the market for spending just a tad more, I recommend trying out CMF Buds Pro 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Pro-Cancelling-Technology/dp/B0D81S532L"><strong>at just $47 today</strong></a>. They upgrade the audio quality and turn that little fidget wheel into a volume rocker, complete with a customizable button and tons of enhanced ANC support. They're my personal favorite, and that little wheel and the sound quality bump is enough for me to recommend them over anything else because of the crazy good price.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

That's where a new face pad comes in, and Kiwi Design makes the best ones on the market. Meta Quest 3 gamers can get the Kiwi Design Quest 3 face pad <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098JTDPQChttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D48YLZJD"><strong>for under $20</strong></a> <em>for the first time ever</em>. Just make sure to clip that $5 coupon on Amazon's site to get the full discount.</p><p>If you've used a Quest but have never changed out the face pad, you don't know what you're missing. Kiwi makes its pads with a super supple, allergen-free PU leather that'll wick the sweat off your skin during these stupidly hot summer days. They're also <em>ultra-easy to clean</em>, so you can share your headset with someone else without needing to put it in a hazmat bag afterwards. Just remove the pad with the velcro backing, clean it with a cloth and a gentle cleaning agent, and it's good as new!</p><p>As a bonus, the plastic piece that snaps into the Meta Quest 3 itself has four ventilation holes on it that not only pull out all the face humidity to keep the lenses from fogging up all the time, but it also helps keep your face cool and somehow magically blocks out light.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-and-quest-3s-controller-upgrades-prime-day-2025"><strong>Meta Quest controller upgrades for under $20 on Prime Day</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4896e2e6-6d36-49da-8205-df7056c8ee41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get sweet relief for your sweating face with this Kiwi Design facial interface replacement for the Meta Quest 3.

It won't last forever, though. You only have today to take advantage of it, should you choose to.</p><p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox/dont-buy-a-kindle-this-prime-day-get-an-onyx-boox-instead">Onyx Boox e-paper tablets are superior</a> and come with unrestricted Android installed, they are also pretty darn expensive. If you don't need anything more than a high-quality E Ink display for reading and writing on, then the Kindle Scribe will serve you perfectly well. This deal includes the Premium Pen, increasing the value prospect even more.</p><p>This epic Prime Day drives down this e-reader's unjustifiable $420 going rate to a wonderfully affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe/dp/B0CZ9TDDN6"><strong>$280 on Amazon</strong></a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>You only have until tomorrow to shop all Amazon Prime Day deals!</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension25="$279.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe/dp/B0CZ9TDDN6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4219px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FRB8bq9d9iGLkwpu2gYMaK" name="Amazon-Kindle-Scribe-2024-render-metallic-jade.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FRB8bq9d9iGLkwpu2gYMaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4219" height="4219" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>It is largely agreed upon that there's nothing like a Kindle when it comes to reading. Therefore, one that comes with a stylus for handwriting input is twice as awesome as a regular one. Usually, the Kindle Scribe makes for a poor purchase. But with this deal, it is a lot cheaper, helping it rise to the top as one of the best e-readers and E Ink tablets that money can buy. This deal includes the Premium Pen with the Kindle Scribe.</p><p><strong>Alternative deal</strong> 🪙: Onyx Boox Go Color 7 - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Go-Color-Gen-II/dp/B0F58ZHCX2/" data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension25="$279.99"><strong>$279.99 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe/dp/B0CZ9TDDN6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension25="$279.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need stylus support, weeks upon weeks of battery life, and a large B&W e-paper display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want unfettered access to Android apps on the Play Store and prefer color e-paper devices.</p><p>I've always had mixed feelings about the Kindle Scribe. While the e-reader slash E Ink tablet is a good product for reading and writing, the $420 price tag is too high. I'd rather recommend more powerful and higher-spec-bearing color e-paper tablets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Color-ePaper-Notebook/dp/B0DT3Q52PN/"><strong>Onyx Boox Note Air 4C for $500</strong></a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Go-Color-Gen-II/dp/B0F58ZHCX2/"><strong>Boox Go Color 7 which is just $280</strong></a>.</p><p>Thanks to this Prime Day deal, though, the Kindle Scribe is finally worth buying. As expected from any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">great E Ink tablet</a>, it has a gorgeous e-paper display that looks just like real books and consumes very little power. The display is what makes a Kindle so stunning, because Amazon's e-paper screens are extremely crisp and lovely to look at. The 10.2-inch display is just the right size, neither too big nor too small. You can choose from 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB storage options.</p><p>Battery-wise, the Kindle Scribe lasts for weeks on a single charge and comes with a USB Type-C port. Unlike some other Kindle models, the Amazon Kindle Scribe does not have water resistance.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

I have a few thermal cameras on hand, and in the last two months, I relied on the handheld Thor 002 imaging camera by Thermal Master to monitor device thermals and identify hot spots.</p><p>The Thor 002 is an all-in-one device, and while the handheld is big ang bulky, it is packed with innovative tech. It has a 3.5-inch 60Hz panel, 5000mAh battery, and a new IR module that gives it a 521 x 384 resolution — considerably higher than other devices in this category. The thermal camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3">costs $284 on Amazon with code TMTHOR002</a>, but that's only until this weekend; after that, it will go up to $399. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-in-1089859931413247931-20">plenty of deals still live</a> if you're looking to buy tech this Prime Day.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4d97ce9a-674f-486b-8ae4-0b1b6108cf8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension48="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension25="$284" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="CziPE5QFjaezE9NpkNTAnJ" name="Thermal Master Thor 002 Handheld Thermal Camera" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CziPE5QFjaezE9NpkNTAnJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Thor 002 is a handheld thermal imaging camera that has the highest-resolution sensor in this category, making it the ideal choice if you need to monitor thermals of a tech gadget or locate any hot spots in your home. </p><p>✅Recommended if: You want a handheld thermal camera with the best sensor. The Thor 002 has a great IR sensor, and it overlays the thermal image over a real-time preview. There are plenty of filters available, and you'll only need to charge the battery once a week. </p><p>❌Skip this deal if: You need a smaller device. Thermal Master also makes a dongle-sized model called the P2 Pro that plugs into your phone, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-P2-Pro-Resolution-Lightning/dp/B0DYDZXCMC" data-dimension112="4d97ce9a-674f-486b-8ae4-0b1b6108cf8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension48="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension25="$284">that model is $239 right now</a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4d97ce9a-674f-486b-8ae4-0b1b6108cf8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension48="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension25="$284">View Deal</a></p></div><p>It's easy to hold and use the Thor 002, and it charges via a USB-C cable. What I like is that you can easily slot in a MicroSD card to store photos. The 3.5-inch panel is ideally suited to monitor thermals, and the 60Hz panel is fluid. The panel has a standard 640×480 resolution, and it uses a new IR sensor to boost the resolution of the image to 521 x 384.</p><p>It's incredibly accurate at monitoring minute changes in heat, and it has the ability to go up to 1,022 degrees F. You get a max/min range, color profiles, and the ability to transfer data to your phone. It even gets 4x digital zoom, and the resolution is usable at that distance. The 5,000mAh battery lasts ten hours between charges, and while there's no fast charging, that really isn't a big omission in this scenario.</p><p>It comes in a hard shell case that's rugged, and the camera itself is built like a tank. The lens has a protective cover that's handy, and you can easily save readings to a MicroSD card. Overall, this is a professional testing tool if you need to monitor thermals or identify leaks, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3">at $299 it is a good value</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

I use the brand's phone cases, and its PolarCircle charger is pretty cool; it has the Qi 2 standard and connects to the back of any phone with a magnetic case, and there's a built-in kickstand that lets you use the phone while it's charging.</p><p>But the best feature has to be the built-in cooling solution. There's a fan that blows cool air, and it also utilizes "TEC semiconductor cooling" to ensure the contact point stays cool. This allows consistent 15W charging, and after using it with my iPhone 16 Pro Max a few dozen times, I'll admit that there's no overheating whatsoever. I notice some heat while using other Qi 2 chargers, but that just isn't the case with the PolarCircle. The Qi 2 charger is usually $59, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV">you can still get it at $44</a> provided you act right now.

The innovative cooling system is the biggest advantage to this charger, and it ensures the phone doesn't overheat even while gaming. Oh, and there's a built-in kickstand as well. </p><p><strong>Other retailers: </strong><a href="https://torraslife.com/products/polarcircle-qi2" data-dimension112="3b6f12a6-eea5-4f7e-a389-eade5963487f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension25="$44"><strong>$49 at Torras</strong></a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a powerful Qi 2 charger that lets you play games while your phone is charging. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Qi 2 power bank instead. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3b6f12a6-eea5-4f7e-a389-eade5963487f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension25="$44">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The PolarCircle does a great job delivering a consistent 15W charge. While it is bulkier than other Qi 2 chargers I used, you can still take it around anywhere with ease. You get a 2m USB-C to USB-C cable in the package, and the built-in kickstand at the back is a welcome addition. The kickstand swivels 360 degrees, so you can easily position the charger as needed.</p><p>The unique cooling solution is designed to ensure there's no overheating, and I tested it while gaming. It does a terrific job ensuring the phone stays cool even during marathon gaming sessions, and that in itself is a huge deal. If nothing else, I'd suggest getting the PolarCircle just for its cooling abilities — the Qi 2 charging is just an added bonus. It is costlier than other Qi 2 chargers, but the cooling mechanism combined with the kickstand makes it worth the price — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV">particularly at the deal price</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Fortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a> is here to alleviate some of that financial pressure, and if you <em>can </em>afford multiple, then I suggest you go for it: one for everyday use, one for the gym, and one for special occasions.</p><p>Depending on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> you own, it's possible that it can play all roles, but some are better suited for certain situations than others.

The projector has one of the brightest projectors in this category, and the ultra short throw nature of the lens means you can put it right next to a wall and get a 150-inch projection — no ceiling mount necessary.</p><p>It has the best picture quality of any projector I used, and the software has exclusive extras, including ambient backgrounds. I used the Aura 2 daily for the last six months, and it has been incredible. While it's still a high-end purchase, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN">down to $2,149 on Amazon</a> until July 12, making it that much more affordable. With the last day of Prime Day rolling around, take a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-in-4117118656319645735-20">all the deals still available</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b0c558d4-7c4b-476a-9465-a1b819d05b4c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension25="$2149" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.93%;"><img id="BTNUmM35Qa8oYSTLumhJoK" name="XGIMI Aura 2" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BTNUmM35Qa8oYSTLumhJoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="839" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Aura 2 is the best UST projector I've used. It is considerably smaller than other models, has an elegant design, gets incredibly bright even in a well-lit room, and is extremely easy to set up and use. You get Android TV out of the box, and the only issue with this projector is that you don't get Netflix. But if you're willing to use a Google TV box, this is the best projector deal around. </p><p><strong>Other retailers: </strong><a href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/aura-2" data-dimension112="b0c558d4-7c4b-476a-9465-a1b819d05b4c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension25="$2149"><strong>$2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1887418-REG/xgimi_wm03b_aura_2_2300_lumen_uhd.html"><strong>$2,699 at B&H Photo</strong></a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a 4K laser projector with Dolby Vision. I used the Aura 2 for the better part of six months now, and it has been incredible. It's a considerable upgrade over the Aura, and it gets brighter than every other UST projector I used. You get auto keystone and autofocus, and it has an auto-closing cover that protects the lens when not in use. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want Netflix pre-installed, or don't need a UST model. If you want to set up a standard ceiling-mounted option, I suggest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Enhanced-Portable-Intelligent/dp/B0DDQ66B6L">getting the Horizon S Max at $1,519</a>. </p><p><strong>Alternate deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NexiGo-Tri-Color-Projector-Adoption-Speakers/dp/B0CHMMDJN7"><strong>NexiGo Aurora Pro</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NexiGo-Tri-Color-Projector-Adoption-Speakers/dp/B0CHMMDJN7"><strong>$1,999 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b0c558d4-7c4b-476a-9465-a1b819d05b4c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension25="$2149">View Deal</a></p></div><p>XGIMI did everything right with the Aura 2; the new design is striking, and it is smaller than the outdoing model. The best feature is a dust cover that prevents any dust ingress into the lens when it's not in use. This has made maintenance that much easier, and the motorized panel adds a decent flair to the design.</p><p>Picture quality is fantastic; I used the projector to see movies and TV shows, and it excels at Dolby Vision and HDR content. It goes up to 2300 lumens, and I didn't see any problems in a well-lit room — it's more than bright enough.</p><p>The Aura 2 is quite good at gaming as well, and I didn't see any issues playing games on the PS5 with the projector. It has latency of 20ms in the gaming mode, and if you want the best UST model in this area, Nexigo's Aurora Pro gets down to 8ms, and that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NexiGo-Tri-Color-Projector-Adoption-Speakers/dp/B0CHMMDJN7">model is also on sale at $1,999 now</a>.</p><p>I still prefer the Aura 2 because of the design, better color vibrancy, and the auto keystone correction. I'm setting up an ALR panel shortly, but I used the projector against a bare wall and didn't see any issues. XGIMI is using a new image engine with wall color switching, so it dynamically adjusts the color balance after taking the background wall color into account. The Amazon deal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN">bringing it down to $2,149 is only valid until July 12</a>, so if you like the look of this projector, I'd suggest acting now.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The network streaming amplifier is incredible; it delivers 60W of power per channel at 8 ohms — going up to 120W at 4 ohms — and it offers the easiest way to connect passive speakers to the internet.</p><p>But you can find plenty of other amps that do the same thing. Where WiiM stands out is its ability to deliver multi-room audio, and the ease of use; its mobile app is loaded with features, and it connects to just about every digital assistant and music platform out there. I used the WiiM Amp with bookshelf speakers for over a year, and I'm buying another two units to connect other speakers I have in the house.</p><p>The $299 asking price in and of itself is a bargain, but for Prime Day, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Amp-Multiroom-Streaming-Chromecast/dp/B0CGCLXH4H">get the Amp at just $239</a>, and that's just an unbeatable value. I have way too much tech and don't need yet another gadget, but the WiiM Amp is in a league of its own, and it's the next-gen Chromecast Audio alternative I didn't know I needed.

The extensive connectivity combined with the ease of use is why the WiiM Amp has dominated Amazon's best-seller lists following its debut a year ago, and it's the reason why I'm buying two units — it's just a great product.

The 4-bay F4-424 Max in particular is terrific; it has the beastly 10-core Intel Core i5 1235U platform, 8GB of RAM, and dual M.2 slots.</p><p>But where it has a clear advantage is with dual 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports. Basically, this is what you buy if you want to set up a high-end Plex NAS server that will last at least a decade. I used it for the better part of six months now, and it has been nothing short of astounding. While it usually retails for $899, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">Prime Day deal brings it down to $674</a>, making it a phenomenal value.

If you're using a NAS and want something with additional power or need a high-end Plex server, this is the one to get. </p><p><strong>Android Central review: ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2</strong></p><p><strong>Other retailers: </strong><a href="https://terramasterus.myshopify.com/products/terramaster-f4-424-max-nas-storage" data-dimension112="dee11c54-cf90-4c24-8f10-eed2971a3387" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $674 at TerraMaster" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $674 at TerraMaster" data-dimension25="$674"><strong>$674 at TerraMaster</strong></a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a high-end NAS. The F4-424 Max has the best hardware in its class, and with two 10 Gigabit ports, you won't have any bottlenecks in this area. This is what I use as my main Plex NAS server now, and it has been incredible. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't need 10GbE connectivity. </p><p><strong>Alternate deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB"><strong>UGREEN DXP4800 Plus</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB"><strong>$519 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="dee11c54-cf90-4c24-8f10-eed2971a3387" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $674 at TerraMaster" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $674 at TerraMaster" data-dimension25="$674">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The new design allows the F4-424 Max to blend into the background a little better, and it gets better active cooling. The minimal aesthetic is great, and it doesn't take up much room. I didn't see any issues with build quality either, and installing drives is about as easy as it gets.</p><p>It's the hardware where this NAS shines; the Intel Core i5 1235U platform is a powerhouse, and it unlocks hardware transcoding in Plex — if you have Plex Pass. There isn't another NAS that has the same caliber of power in this category, and if you want a high-end server to run Docker containers, Plex, and a dozen other utilities, you'll need to get this.</p><p>While most NAS systems now get a 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, you'll see two of these on the back of the F4-424 Max. What that essentially means is that even if you use the dual M.2 drives to slot in SSDs, the bandwidth won't be the bottleneck. The TOS 6 software is much better as well, and it has a modern design combined with plenty of useful additions, including a native Plex client.</p><p>I've tested dozens of NAS systems over the years, and the F4-424 Max is my go-to choice if you need a high-end server in 2025. There isn't anything missing on this NAS, and the $225 discount is highly enticing — but the deal won't last. This is your last chance to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">get the F4-424 Max at $674</a>, so you better act fast.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Govee's outdoor lighting products have been a runaway hit, so much so that it set up an entire division focused on creating new products in this category. I used the Outdoor String Lights and the String Lights 2 back when they launched, and they did a great job; that's why I was excited to see what the brand had to offer with its latest product, the Outdoor Clear Bulb String Lights.</p><p>As the name suggests, the Clear Bulb String Lights have a transparent housing that has better light transmittivity, and the new design looks much more elegant than the previous models. Thankfully, the casing itself is made out of polycarbonate and not glass, so they don't break; my two-year-old loves playing with these lights, and they've proven to be durable. They usually cost $99, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof/dp/B0DR1SHBT1">they're now down to $79</a>, a decent discount. Need other products? Take a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-in-6316728457549589357-20">all the deals live now</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="7f83e239-573d-4b66-9108-0602cc4f3347" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternate deal: Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft)" data-dimension48="Alternate deal: Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft)" data-dimension25="$79" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof/dp/B0DR1SHBT1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1448px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.59%;"><img id="4TpyJCmqvAkrHmME3YsvUY" name="Govee Outdoor Clear Bulb String Lights" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4TpyJCmqvAkrHmME3YsvUY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1448" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>These are Govee's best outdoor lights yet. They diffuse light well, go up to 80 lumen, the RGB LEDs have over a hundred built-in effects, and the polycarbonate shell is built to last. They have IP67 water resistance as well, so there are no issues using these lights outdoors. </p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need outdoor lights that can be easily controlled with your phone. Govee's app has standout features, and you also have the ability to pair these lights with Home Assistant. The lights have vibrant LEDs, great effects, and are durable. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't want clear lights. </p><p><strong>Alternate deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof-Assistant/dp/B0CT4ZR4Y9" data-dimension112="7f83e239-573d-4b66-9108-0602cc4f3347" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternate deal: Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft)" data-dimension48="Alternate deal: Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft)" data-dimension25="$79"><strong>Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft) </strong></a><strong>—</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof-Assistant/dp/B0CT4ZR4Y9"><strong> $109 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof/dp/B0DR1SHBT1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7f83e239-573d-4b66-9108-0602cc4f3347" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternate deal: Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft)" data-dimension48="Alternate deal: Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft)" data-dimension25="$79">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Govee did a great job with the design of the Clear Bulb String Lights; they look much better than their predecessors, and I like the polycarbonate housing — it diffuses light very well. I'm using the 48ft model, and that's adequate for my needs; if you've got a bigger backyard, Govee <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof/dp/B0F23QKYFY">sells a 96ft model of the same</a> — but there's no deal on that.</p><p>The lights are extremely easy to set up and use, and what I like the most is the built-in lighting effects; just connect the lights to the Govee Home app, and you can unlock over 100 lighting effects and presets. It's straightforward to change brightness, lighting modes, and set up schedules, and this is where Govee's products truly shine.</p><p>Each bulb has 80-lumen brightness, and if you don't want RGB lighting, they default to the standard 2700k warm white mode. They connect via Matter, and once set up, you can easily change lighting modes via Google Assistant or Alexa. The hassle-free usability and bright lighting makes these the ideal choice if you want backyard or patio lighting, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof/dp/B0DR1SHBT1">20% discount makes the lights that much more affordable</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Another patent outlined a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/next-galaxy-ring-could-come-with-sensors-to-measure-body-and-surface-temperatures">dual temperature sensor</a> that would still measure your skin temperature but also check the temperature of something else (like a child's forehead) with the <em>outside</em> of the ring. And other patents have suggested this ring could serve as a controller for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's VR headset</a>.</p><p>No patent is guaranteed to be used, but the Galaxy Ring 2 will definitely have upgrades over the first-gen model. And currently, Samsung is more focused on sleep tracking for its <em>smartwatches</em>, giving the Galaxy Watch 8 a Bedtime Guidance tool to analyze your circadian rhythm and suggest an ideal bedtime. Apparently, the Galaxy Ring won't support this, though we're still waiting on confirmation from Samsung.</p><p>That's why you may want to skip this compelling Galaxy Ring deal. Not because we think it'll get that much cheaper later, but because you may want to hold out another year for Samsung to nail the smart ring formula with the Ring 2, adding new sensors and tricks to make it stand out from its smart ring rivals.</p><p>If the Galaxy Ring doesn't appeal to you and you're not willing to wait, there are plenty of alternatives on sale for Prime Day that'll fall into the same price range, if not lower!

The problem is, wireless audio is also expensive. If you're on a tight budget, it's almost always smarter to pick up a great pair of wired earbuds or in-ear monitors (IEMs) rather than waste money on a cheap pair of truly wireless earbuds.</p><p>If you want to upgrade your audio during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Amazon Prime Day</a>, you can do so while spending less than $20 by picking up one of these in-ear monitors. You'll get excellent sound quality and a detachable cable on all three of my picks, and two of them have optional microphones. I love Prime Day deals that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sony-wf-1000xm5-under-usd200-prime-day-limited-time">cut the prices of the best wireless earbuds</a>, but it's still hard to beat good old-fashioned wired earbuds.</p><p>Whether you need wired headphones for traveling, gaming, or just streaming music on your phone, these are the Prime Day deals you NEED to see before they run out.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1124689220047358064-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends tomorrow!

Best of all, the 10mm dynamic driver inside the ZSN Pro X earbuds produce a ridiculous amount of bass for something of their size.</p><p>You can grab the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Monitors-Headphones-Fidelity-Detachable-Tangle-Free/dp/B08DNHYQTL/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">microphone-free version for just $19.19, </a>or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Monitors-Headphones-Fidelity-Detachable-Tangle-Free/dp/B08DNHTF69/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">get the microphone version for only 80 cents more.</a></p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a91d7db4-597e-4046-99cf-a79fe96e70d1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="KZ ZSN Pro X: $23.99" data-dimension48="KZ ZSN Pro X: $23.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Monitors-Headphones-Fidelity-Detachable-Tangle-Free/dp/B08DNHYQTL/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:679px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.83%;"><img id="YdDYWZT58L3dFJB8YNBYHG" name="KZ ZSN Pro X iem" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YdDYWZT58L3dFJB8YNBYHG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="679" height="705" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>KZ ZSN Pro X: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monitors-Headphones-Fidelity-Detachable-Tangle-Free/dp/B08DNHYQTL/?th=1" data-dimension112="a91d7db4-597e-4046-99cf-a79fe96e70d1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="KZ ZSN Pro X: $23.99" data-dimension48="KZ ZSN Pro X: $23.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$23.99</del> <strong>$19.19 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>KZ's ZSN Pro X set the bar for cheap, quality audio.

These are a lot smaller and lighter due to their plastic construction, but you still get a standout 10mm driver. You also have a sleek design with neat gold accents and a replaceable cable.

They're great for throwing in a bag as a backup plan in case you forget your primary audio gear at home. If you grab a microphone-equipped version, you can take Google Meet or Zoom calls on the go without relying on your phone or laptop's awful mic quality.</p><p>I also like wired earbuds because they're cheap — you can be a bit reckless with them, not worrying about damaging gear worth hundreds of dollars. Sometimes I'll take these on a run or hike, or while traveling, because it won't be the end of the world if they get lost or damaged. All three of these options have detachable cables, which is great for repairability.</p><p>After you've picked up a pair of wired IEMs, don't forget to buy a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter. I wish the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> still had a headphone jack, but that's a story for another day.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="46d68836-db15-44b7-8193-3d28b9f7b621" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension48="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Converter-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B082WG5VTK/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="dcJtXzMHdEVa5scBJi6SqF" name="UGreen-USBC-Audio-Adapter" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dcJtXzMHdEVa5scBJi6SqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Converter-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B082WG5VTK/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="46d68836-db15-44b7-8193-3d28b9f7b621" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension48="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$9.99</del> <strong>$7.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>This tiny and cheap adapter will turn your device's USB-C port into a 3.5mm port for easy, wired connection to any of the earbuds on this list. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Converter-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B082WG5VTK/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="46d68836-db15-44b7-8193-3d28b9f7b621" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension48="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-77">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-7144284460815907008-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day ENDS tomorrow: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1125421941494451889-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2331615209002580149-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9655087999259234463-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3558196267450012492-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>
