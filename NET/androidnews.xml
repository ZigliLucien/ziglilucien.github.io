                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google announced a slew of upgrades to YouTube and YouTube Music last week, including support for custom playlist thumbnails.</li><li>Previously, users could ask generative AI to create a thumbnail for them, but could not upload their own.</li><li>Now, users are starting to see the feature appear in the YouTube Music web player after verifying their phone number. Mobile app support seems to be coming later.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music" target="_blank">YouTube Music</a> are getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-and-youtube-music-gain-new-improvements">a few new features</a> this month, and a big one is starting to roll out: custom playlist thumbnails. YouTube Music is a formidable competitor to Apple Music and Spotify, especially if you already pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a>. However, it sometimes lacks core features that we take for granted in other music streaming apps. Now, YouTube Music is catching up to its competition by letting users upload their own photos and artwork as playlist thumbnails.</p><p>The feature is appearing widely for YouTube Music users on the platform's web player, found at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://music.youtube.com" target="_blank">music.youtube.com</a>. The rollout was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/21/youtube-music-playlist-thumbnail/" target="_blank">first spotted by 9to5Google</a>, and it appears to be limited to the YouTube Music web client for the time being. Additionally, YouTube seems to be requiring users to verify their phone numbers before uploading photos. If you're not seeing the option for custom thumbnails, check that your phone is verified.</p><p>After opening a playlist, you can tap on the pencil icon to select a photo from your phone, tablet, or computer. The web client offers a built-in cropping tool, allowing you to resize your custom image to fit the playlist's square aspect ratio. After that, you're all set — but you can tap the pencil icon and select <strong>Remove custom image</strong> to revert your changes at any time. </p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a>, like Apple Music and Spotify, have offered custom playlist thumbnails for quite a while, allowing users to personalize their playlists as they see fit. The custom playlist thumbnails are perhaps more useful to YouTube Music subscribers, but they're also available on YouTube, as Google showcases in the video below. </p>

<p>Oddly enough, YouTube has offered a way for users to personalize their playlist thumbnails since 2023, but it has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-generative-ai-art-experiment">limited to AI-generated artwork</a>. Being that playlists are always made with a personal touch, using your own photos feels like a natural choice. </p><p>Luckily, YouTube Music subscribers don't have to feel envious of other streaming services with the emergence of custom playlist thumbnails on the platform. Next, we'll be keeping our eye out to see if the feature makes its way to the YouTube Music mobile app, or if there are any limitations.</p>

We tested our Meta Quest 3S review unit for ourselves and found that it <em>does</em> last 2.5 hours in ideal conditions, such as standard gaming or streaming YouTube VR.</p>
<p>However, when playing a graphically intense, Quest 3-enhanced game, the Quest 3S battery life fell to 2 hours, closer to how long the Meta Quest 3 typically lasts. Heavily using mixed-reality passthrough, internet browsing, or other "productivity" software will burn through battery more quickly as well.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="why-the-meta-quest-3s-apos-s-battery-life-is-better-than-the-quest-3-apos-s-2">Why the Meta Quest 3S&apos;s battery life is better than the Quest 3&apos;s</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> (4,324mAh) has a smaller capacity than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> (5,060mAh), but the budget headset still lasts longer for day-to-day usage while using the same Snapdragon XR2 CPU and 8GB of RAM.</p><p>It&apos;s one of the rare <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 3S vs. 3</a> differences that points in the cheaper headset&apos;s favor. We suspect it lasts longer because the Quest 3S has a lower-resolution display and last-gen Fresnel lenses that don&apos;t require as much brightness as the Quest 3&apos;s pancake lenses.</p><p>Our Quest 3S tester Nick Sutrich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-one-week-impressions">spent one week with the Quest 3S</a> and will be publishing his full review soon. Having run the headset through several power cycles, he agrees with Meta&apos;s assessment that the Quest 3S is more efficient than the Quest 3. But he also found that when playing a AAA Quest game that we can&apos;t discuss publicly yet, it cancelled out the Quest 3S&apos; battery advantage.</p><p>For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Oculus Quest 2</a> also had a battery-life max of 2.5 hours with a last-gen Snapdragon XR2 CPU, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-2">same lenses & resolution as the Quest 3S</a> but a smaller capacity (3,640mAh). However, most of these old headsets have lost battery capacity over the last few years, making the Quest 3S a return to the norm.</p><p>While 2–2.5 hours of playtime is enough for many Quest gamers, others will find it insufficient for long, immersive play sessions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-extend-the-meta-quest-3-battery-life-2">How to extend the Meta Quest 3 battery life</h2>
<p>The Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v59-update-adds-battery-saver-mode-fix">Quest v59 update</a> added a Battery Saver mode that sets a fixed refresh rate (72Hz), brightness (50% of max), and reduced foveated rendering. You can find it in the full settings menu under Power if you need to stretch your limited Quest 3S battery life in a pinch.</p><p>This is a temporary compromise, not a long-term solution. If battery life is a regular issue, we recommend buying a replacement head strap with a built-in battery pack. Meta sells an official one for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/elite-strap-battery/" rel="nofollow"><strong>costly $130</strong></a>.</p><p>Among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best 3rd-party Quest 3S accessories</a>, our favorite is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR"><strong>BOBOVR M3 Pro</strong></a>, which costs significantly less. It&apos;s a huge comfort upgrade over the default Quest 3S cloth strap and adds another 5,200mAh of battery capacity, more than the Quest 3S itself has. It&apos;ll add another couple hours of playtime to the headset. It even has a quick-swap battery design, so if you pay extra for a second battery you can keep it charged and swap it in when the first battery dies.</p><p>You probably don&apos;t need the total 4–7 hours of playtime it potentially offers, but it gives you a buffer in case you forget to keep your Quest 3S charged and don&apos;t want to wait two hours to start.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S uses the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 and 4MP RGB cameras, enabling enhanced games and mixed-reality experiences that the Quest 2 can't handle.

<p>AI has become a trend that has taken the world by storm. Tech bigwigs like Samsung, Google, and Apple all made AI an integral part of their latest flagship phones. Unsurprisingly, accessory brands like Logitech are now bringing AI into the peripherals and accessories space as well.</p><p>Logitech just launched a brand new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-bluetooth-keyboard-for-android">Bluetooth keyboard</a> as an extension of its POP lineup. The latest entrant to this stylish family of peripherals is named the POP Icon Keys, and it has AI features baked in. AI on a Bluetooth keyboard might sound outlandish and ridiculous, but Logitech doesn't fool around, so I decided to go into this review with an open mind.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CyB4NaD39pJfU6XCHbR7kc" name="Logitech-POP-ICON-Combo-lifestyle-5.jpeg" alt="Logitech POP ICON Keys keyboard and POP mouse in pink" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CyB4NaD39pJfU6XCHbR7kc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pop series features peripherals with compact form factors and splashy color combinations like orange and white or hot pink and rose gold. Up until now, the POP lineup consisted of the tiny POP Mouse and the compact POP Keys mechanical keyboard. Both devices are compatible with various platforms, including Android.</p><p>You can get the Logitech POP ICON Keys keyboard standalone for $50 or with the POP Mouse as part of the POP Combo for $70. It is much more compact than the POP Keys mechanical keyboard, but the colorways are the same, and it stays consistent with the design language and color story of the POP series.</p>

<p>For the sake of intense testing, I typed out this entire hands-on review using the POP Icon Keys keyboard. And get this: I actually typed on three different devices while switching mediums to finish the entire article. This includes my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-review">Lenovo Duet 5 Chromebook</a>, and HP Victus 16 laptop.</p><p>The initial setup took hardly a few seconds on my laptop. I proceeded to add two more devices, which took about 10 to 15 seconds each, which is mind-blowingly fast. Even my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TV</a> paired with the keyboard in under 30 seconds. Thanks to the three dedicated Easy Switch buttons on the keyboard, connecting to and switching between three devices is blazing quick. I am obliged to say that multi-platform connectivity was seamless and superbly good fun.</p><p>While it isn't a new release, I decided to use the POP mouse with the keyboard as they are part of the same family and are meant to be used together. I found that the keyboard switches much faster than the mouse since it has dedicated keys for each of the three devices connected simultaneously. With the mouse, you need to turn it around and click a button to switch.</p>

<p>Typing with the new Logitech POP Icon Keys keyboard takes some getting used to, as is the case with any new keyboard. The low profile of the compact keyboard isn’t always ideal for fast and accurate typing, but it’s not fair to compare such a slim and affordable keyboard with the prowess of a 100% full-sized keyboard, of course. After an hour or so of typing, I got used to its layout and size.</p><p>Its compact size works in its favor when traveling because the Logitech POP ICON Keys is lightweight and impressively slim. It's almost as slim as my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-review">Duet 5 Chromebook</a>. I had no trouble fitting both the POP Icon Keys and POP Mouse in a tote bag, along with the Duet 5 Chromebook. The bag wasn't too heavy either, so I know I'll be taking it out on the go with me again.</p>

<p>At first glance, you could say the fun begins with the design of the keyboard. The color combinations are bold and highly attractive. You can't help but want to own the POP series of peripherals for purely superficial reasons. But the good part comes afterward when you actually start to use the keyboard.</p><p>The Logitech POP Icon Keys keyboard is one of the most versatile wireless keyboards I have ever used. It works with almost every single popular operating system, be it iOS, Windows, Android, Linux, Chrome OS, or Google TV. I suspect it will connect with anything at this point.</p>

<p>There are a total of 15 customizable keys on the Logitech POP Icon Keys keyboard. What's really cool is that Logitech added an AI prompt builder to the companion application, Logi Options Plus. You can customize any key to do a number of things via this computer app, broadly categorized into two main groups: Smart Actions and Other Actions.</p>
<p>Smart Actions include actions like <strong>Open AI Prompt Builder</strong>, <strong>Open ChatGPT</strong>, and <strong>Ask Perplexity</strong>. These functions can be further customized by editing every step that makes up each action. You can do this through the Logi Options Plus app by heading into the Smart Actions and selecting an option to customize further.</p><p>And if that level of control isn't enough, you can even create your own Smart Actions from scratch. It's almost like programming an algorithm, where you create conditions, triggers, and step-by-step actions to happen sequentially.</p><p>Unfortunately, these cool shortcuts don't work with every device. If you truly want to enjoy the best features of the Logitech POP ICON Keys, you have to use it with a laptop or a PC. I also highly suggest using the POP Mouse along with the Logitech POP Icon Keys keyboard because it has similarly customizable buttons that can be used with the Logi Options Plus app and can be assigned Smart Actions, too.</p>

<p>Using both the POP Mouse and ICON Keys together with an Android phone, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> transforms your mobile device into a productivity machine. I can see students as well as working professionals using this bundle, especially while traveling. These battery-powered accessories last for years before needing their batteries changed. You need AAA batteries for both, which isn't exactly eco-friendly, but since they last so long, you won't need to change them very often.</p><p>The multi-device connectivity and smooth operation of both Bluetooth accessories even convinced me to actually use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/why-im-switching-from-chromebook-to-surface-tablet">my Chromebook, with which I have a love-hate relationship</a>. It goes to show that with the right accessories, you can maximize your productivity to a new level.</p><p>The POP Mouse and its former partner, the POP Keys mechanical keyboard, have always been really popular. I can see why Logitech has introduced a regular non-mechanical keyboard to the POP series. It is so much more compact and quieter than the POP Keys mechanical keyboard, making it attractive to a wider audience. Not everyone wants a loud keyboard, especially if you're a student sitting in a library or a working person typing in a shared office.</p><p>If you ask me whether you should buy the Logitech POP ICON Keys keyboard, it's a very passionate yes from me. The only thing I'd add is that if you can afford it, pay another $20 and get the Logitech POP ICON Combo instead. It comes with the POP Mouse, which adds a lot of functionality to your workflow, especially when used in tandem with the POP Icon Keys.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Find My Device app is finally letting you log in with biometrics for faster and safer access on Android.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/find-my-device-biometric-login-3492571/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reports that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> is rolling out the much-anticipated biometric login support in version 3.1.173-1 of the app on Android. Now, you can easily access the app using facial recognition or fingerprint scanning on top of your regular PIN.</p><p>Before this, the only way in was through your Google account password. There were already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-extra-user-security-spotted">reports in May of this year that Google was planning a biometric login</a> for the Find My Device app, so its arrival now isn’t shocking. More importantly, this update beefs up the app’s security even more.</p><p>Before biometric authentication came along, users could skip the password prompt for future logins by checking the 'Don't ask again' box. While this made things easier, it also raised security concerns. If someone had access to an unlocked device, they could easily get into Find My Device, risking the privacy and security of the user's devices.</p><p>Thanks to biometric authentication, the 'Don't ask again' option becomes a thing of the past. Now, users will have to confirm their identity each time they launch the app.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that biometric login seems to be turned on by default in the Find My Device app. This is a shift from when the feature was first spotted earlier this year, where it was just an optional setting that users could turn off.</p><p>Besides the new biometric login, Find My Device is also getting a tablet-friendly makeover. The current version has a bottom sheet menu that you can expand or collapse, but a fresh update will switch to a side panel layout, giving you more space for the map display.</p><p>The side panel will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">all the same handy options as the bottom menu</a>. But as for when we can expect this tablet-friendly update, that's still a bit of a mystery.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp users will soon be able to save contacts from WhatsApp Web and Windows devices.</li><li>Until now, people could only save contacts for WhatsApp on their primary phone.</li><li>The ultimate aim of the messaging platform is to soon add usernames instead of phone numbers and the ability to sync them irrespective of the device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta has revealed some exciting new features coming to WhatsApp, making it simpler to add and manage contacts. Soon, users will be able to privately add and manage their contacts, no matter what device they’re using.</p><p>While the messaging platform already offers cross-platform support, users were able to add a new contact only via the primary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> or iOS handset—by adding a phone number or scanning a QR code.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="FZ9gNWt29dNvPWQhGWoord" name="WhatsApp-logo.jpg" alt="Whatsapp logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZ9gNWt29dNvPWQhGWoord.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a press release, WhatsApp notes that users will soon be able to add and manage contacts through WhatsApp Web and also through Windows platforms or their preferred device, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a>.</p><p>In some cases, users would want a certain contact only on WhatsApp and not as a contact on their phone contacts list. The messaging platform also adds such possibility, making handling personal and business numbers easier. It helps when people have more than one account on their device.</p>
<p>WhatsApp adds that contacts saved on the messaging platform can be readily restored when a user switches devices, which will be useful if they lose their smartphones and phone numbers.</p><p>The messaging platform's primary aim with the introduction of these new capabilities is to eventually "manage and save contacts by usernames." </p><p>Usernames aren't new, and most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android apps</a> and even Meta-owned apps like Instagram utilize them. They create a unique identity for a person, irrespective of their phone number. This is an extra layer of privacy on the platform, which is likely to be coming soon to WhatsApp.</p>
<p>It is encouraging to see WhatsApp add such functionality. Hopefully, it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-spam-india">prevent people from spam</a>, which rely heavily on phone numbers shared with businesses. </p><p>WhatsApp has also shared that the new feature to manage contacts across platforms is specifically designed for a new encrypted storage system dubbed Identity Proof Linked Storage (IPLS) that allows users to store contacts directly on WhatsApp, as mentioned. </p><p>It further allows new contacts to get synced to their phone even if saved from another WhatsApp-linked device. The IPLS also assures that stored contact names are encrypted within the platform, which is seen only by the user. </p>

<ul><li>Songs are a key part of Instagram: they can be added to posts, stories, and Reels on the platform.</li><li>Now, when a user hears a song they like on Instagram, they can save it to their Spotify account with just a few tops.</li><li>For the time being, this integration only works with Spotify. TikTok, meanwhile, offers a similar feature that works with Spotify, Amazon Music, and Apple Music.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Music discovery happens differently today than it did a few decades ago. Instead of people finding their favorite songs on the radio or in movies, they're discovering the latest hits on social media sites like TikTok and Instagram.</p><p>Last year, TikTok added an <strong>Add to Music app</strong> feature that made it easier to save songs heard on the platform to a streaming service. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram">Instagram</a> is catching up — users will be able to save songs heard on posts, stories, and Reels to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify">Spotify</a> music library.</p><p>Without music-saving integration in social media apps, there can be friction in the music discovery process. Users hear a song they like and then have to click on the sound in the post, story, or Reel to learn more about it, like the song title and artist. Previously, they'd have to open the music streaming service of their choice manually, find the song they heard, and add it to their library. It was a cumbersome process, and people in a rush might have neglected to add a song they liked simply due to how many steps it required.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">find a song on Instagram ➡️ save to your @Spotify 🎧 pic.twitter.com/dP0ycYR3rI<a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1846947780008305075">October 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Now, the whole experience is streamlined. All you have to do is tap the song you heard in a post, story, or Reel to open up its song card in the Instagram app. From there, you'll see an <strong>Add</strong> button next to the scrubber with a Spotify logo. After you've tapped that button, it'll change to <strong>Added</strong>, and that's it — the song will be in your <strong>Liked Songs </strong>playlist.</p><p>To use the feature, make sure both of your Instagram and Spotify apps are updated. You'll need to link your accounts the first time you add a song, but the experience will require only two taps afterward.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sZWCx7PCbnLqWCYegRx2ak" name="Instagram-Save-To-Spotify.jpg" alt="The Save to Spotify process in the Instagram app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sZWCx7PCbnLqWCYegRx2ak.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It'll be much easier to add Instagram songs to Spotify now that you don't have to leave the Instagram app to do it. Spotify is the largest music streaming service in the world, so many users will be able to take advantage of this feature. Unfortunately, no other music streaming services are supported. If you happen to use something like YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Apple Music, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-vs-tidal">Tidal</a>, you will be out of luck.</p><p>TikTok added the similar <strong>Add to Music app</strong> feature about a year ago, and it does support more music streaming platforms. When it launched, TikTok supported Spotify, Amazon Music, or Apple Music. In that way, TikTok is still ahead in compatibility, and Amazon Music or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music</a> subscribers will still find the video-first platform better for music discovery.</p>

While Xiaomi and OPPO do this on a standard basis, Vivo has been consistent with bringing its entire portfolio to global markets, and I was particularly keen on the X100 Ultra, as it was positioned as Vivo&apos;s ultimate camera phone of 2024.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> have been really great this year, and I&apos;m glad to say that the X100 Ultra follows in a similar fashion. If anything, Vivo&apos;s Chinese-exclusive Origin OS software is better than what we usually get on the brand&apos;s global models, and while it wasn&apos;t the most straightforward to use out of the box, it became easier once I had the Play Store installed.</p><p>Vivo isn&apos;t waiting around either; it launched the V40 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v40-pro-review">V40 Pro</a> to take on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">X200 series</a> has made its debut in China and should be available globally sometime early next week. But the X100 Ultra continues to be my go-to choice, and if I can only pick one device as the best overall in 2024, then it would be this one — so it&apos;s a shame, really, that you can&apos;t actually buy it.</p>

<p>Vivo unveiled the X100 Ultra at an event in China on May 13, and the phone went on sale in the country starting May 28. The device costs 7,099 RMB ($996) for the version with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, and it is also available in 12GB/256GB editions and a 16GB/1TB model, which is what I&apos;m using.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x100-ultra-design"><span>Vivo X100 Ultra: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xscbNXVRFLwPsofUqoymMM" name="vivo-x100-ultra-4.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xscbNXVRFLwPsofUqoymMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo has a distinct design language, and while the X100 Ultra shares similarities to the X100 Pro, it does a few things differently. The camera design at the back is much more distinctive; the X100 Ultra has an even larger island, and the groove that encircles it has greater definition, making it stand out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RSKGU5vw42daTzKo45vuqN" name="vivo-x100-ultra-15.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RSKGU5vw42daTzKo45vuqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m using the white color variant, and it looks elegant in its own right — even though it doesn&apos;t have the Find X7 Ultra&apos;s flamboyant leather designs. The silver-accented camera island along with the black around the individual modules create enough contrast to distinguish the design, and while it is one of the biggest camera modules on a phone today, there are no issues with usability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5rJv2doyopskL53qduVLiM" name="vivo-x100-ultra-11.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rJv2doyopskL53qduVLiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the island extends to cover most of the width at the back, it essentially props up the device at a subtle angle when it&apos;s on a tablet, so you don&apos;t get any wobble. The X100 Ultra is also a little thicker around the sides than the X100 Pro, and this makes a sizeable difference in usability. Vivo thankfully isn&apos;t getting on the trend of boxy sides, and the X100 Ultra has smooth curves and rounded edges, and the matte aluminum mid-fame feels great to hold and use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TY7EhKCF7tDZqLzhj5be5N" name="vivo-x100-ultra-14.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TY7EhKCF7tDZqLzhj5be5N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The glass back is protected by Vivo&apos;s custom solution (instead of Gorilla Glass), and while the X100 Ultra has a satin texture at the back, the white color option does a good job hiding smudges, and while it is one of the heaviest phones around at 229g, you don&apos;t notice the heft — it has excellent weight distribution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jvnAjxCXnM8EPDMifzAUHP" name="vivo-x100-ultra-13.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jvnAjxCXnM8EPDMifzAUHP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cumulatively, the X100 Ultra has gotten over four months of use, all without a case. After a dozen tumbles — some from nearly six feet — the device is still pristine, and that should serve as a testament to Vivo&apos;s build quality. While the brand bundles a silicone case in the box, I didn&apos;t feel the need to use it, and given the long-term durability, I don&apos;t think you need one with this phone — I can&apos;t say the same of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DvL26oz2csHzvt25MKemeN" name="vivo-x100-ultra-12.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DvL26oz2csHzvt25MKemeN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X100 Ultra has IP68 ingress protection, and the device has no issues in this area. While the Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra have issues with condensation getting into the camera island, I didn&apos;t notice those problems on any other brands. Overall, the X100 Ultra has one of the best designs of 2024, and it has proven durability.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x100-ultra-display"><span>Vivo X100 Ultra: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6tKfbPbaXrvdFD4vHjCMJQ" name="vivo-x100-ultra-16.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6tKfbPbaXrvdFD4vHjCMJQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo didn&apos;t change the panel, and the X100 Ultra uses the same 6.78-inch LTPO OLED as the X100 Pro. The key difference is that you get increased resolution — 3200 x 1440 — but otherwise, it has the same 120Hz dynamic refresh, 1440Hz PWM dimming, and 3000-nit maximum brightness.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9sdxYrskxSzq5nSK6zWehS" name="vivo-x100-ultra-19.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9sdxYrskxSzq5nSK6zWehS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In real-world use, the X100 Ultra gets incredibly bright; in fact, only the Pixel 9 Pro XL gets brighter than the device in auto mode. There are absolutely no issues in this area, and the panel outshines its rivals with ease. It has Dolby Vision integration as well, and it does a great job with HDR content in general.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QbiT3UUsaAsZuisymdh6AR" name="vivo-x100-ultra-20.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbiT3UUsaAsZuisymdh6AR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Colors are predictably vivid, and the subtle curves around the sides make it that much more immersive. I didn&apos;t have any problems while streaming content or playing games, and if you need a vibrant OLED panel that gets bright and is highly customizable, the X100 Ultra is an easy recommendation. Vivo did a good job with the built-in sound as well, and it gets as loud as the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — no small feat.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x100-ultra-hardware"><span>Vivo X100 Ultra: Hardware</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nNY7Fmvh89SqLMChiXrTyP" name="vivo-x100-ultra-21.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nNY7Fmvh89SqLMChiXrTyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Vivo went with Dimensity 9300 in the X100 series, the X100 Ultra uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. The variant I&apos;m using has 16GB of RAM and 1TB storage, and it is among the fastest devices I used this year. It is fluid in regular use, the interface is optimized to take advantage of the hardware, and there are no slowdowns.</p>
<p>It holds up incredible well at gaming as well, and there are no issues in demanding titles. The only problem is that it gets hotter than the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and the X100 Pro; I measured 44 degrees at the back of the unit after extended gaming sessions, and that&apos;s on the higher end of the scale.</p>

<p>In 3DMark&apos;s Solar Bay stress test, the device went up to 57 degrees, and I had to set it aside as it became too hot. The stability score of 71% is average, but it&apos;s clear that Vivo didn&apos;t set any aggressive thermal limits on the device — as evidenced by the overheating.</p>
<p>I didn&apos;t see any problems in other areas; the X100 Ultra delivered a strong cellular and Wi-Fi signal, Bluetooth connectivity was rock-solid, and you get the full suite of AptX codecs. I dislike ultrasonic fingerprint sensors as they tend to be slow and not as easy to use as the optical modules, but Vivo does a great job with these modules, and that&apos;s no different on the X100 Ultra, with the device using Goodix&apos;s latest solution. The recognition area is suitably large, and it is fast to authenticate.</p>

<p>The X100 Ultra isn&apos;t the fastest-charging phone I used this year by any margin, but it has incredible battery life, and just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a>, it uses a silicon-carbon battery that increases density while ensuring the device isn&apos;t bulky. The result is that you get a 5500mAh battery, and the phone lasts a day and a half between charges.</p><p>I usually get better battery life when using phones with Chinese skins; they have more aggressive memory management, and the same is true of the X100 Ultra as well. As there&apos;s no global version of the phone, it comes with Vivo&apos;s China-only software, and the battery lasts longer than the Find X7 Ultra, Xiaomi 14 Ultra, and the X100 Pro.</p><p>Charging takes just over 50 minutes via the bundled 80W charger, and while this is slower than what you get on the likes of the OnePlus 12, it is much better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x100-ultra-cameras"><span>Vivo X100 Ultra: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RMAKcRXYPtVNThvfyaL6TN" name="vivo-x100-ultra-9.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMAKcRXYPtVNThvfyaL6TN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The main reason to consider the X100 Ultra is the cameras; Vivo already did a great job with the camera package on the X100 Pro, but the X100 Ultra takes things to a whole new level. The phone uses the same 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-900 main camera with the massive 1/0.98-inch module and 1.6um pixels, and it gets Vivo&apos;s gimbal-based OIS.</p><p>It&apos;s joined by a 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-600 f/2.2 wide-angle with a modest 116-degree FoV, and the star of the show is the 200MP Samsung HP9 telephoto, which uses a 1/1.4-inch lens, goes up to 3.7x optical zoom, and has OIS. You get a 50MP camera at the front, and it has autofocus and the ability to shoot 4K60 video. In fact, all four cameras can shoot 4K60 video, and you even get the ability to do so at 10x zoom.</p><p>Vivo has Dolby Vision video at 4K60 as well with the rear cameras, and the device does an excellent job in this area. You get good stabilization even at a high zoom level, and if you don&apos;t need HDR video, you can go up to 4K120 and 8K30 on this device. Similar to Xiaomi with its Leica partnership, Vivo has a long-standing collaboration with Zeiss, and the X100 Ultra uses three styles — Vivid, Textured, and Natural. The Natural style adds vignetting and creates moody shots, so I went with the Vivid option.</p><p>The Lytia LYT-900 module is a known quantity by this point, and it delivers outstanding photos in any scenario. The X100 Ultra delivers the same caliber of shots as the X100 Pro in daylight situations, with great color rendition and white balance. Because of the switch to Qualcomm, you get minute differences in image quality, and I prefer the shots taken with the X100 Ultra over the Pro model.</p>

<p>The main camera takes the best low-light shots of any device, with excellent detail retrieval and minimal noise. Like the X100 Pro, the Ultra tends to deliver overly-bright images with vibrant colors, and while not necessarily accurate, the resultant shots look great when shared on social media. The wide-angle lens does a great job in this area as well, and while I don&apos;t take as many wide-angle shots, I use this mode quite a lot with videos, and it is better than other phones I used this year.</p><p>But it&apos;s the telephoto lens that&apos;s been a revelation. It takes fabulous photos at up to 3.7x zoom, and you get usable shots at 10x — if anything, it does a better job than the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Galaxy S24 Ultra in this regard. Where it truly shines is with portrait shots; the X100 Ultra takes the best portrait shots of any phone, and what&apos;s particularly great is that it does so across various focal lengths.</p>
<p>I thought the Find X7 Ultra would be unchallenged in this category, but the X100 Ultra consistently delivers better portrait shots, and it is in a league of its own — no other flagship has the same consistency or detail. You also get terrific macro shots, and while I don&apos;t take many macros, it was fun to use the mode to shoot photos of artisan keys on my keyboards.</p><p>After taking thousands of photos and hundreds of videos, I can confidently say that the X100 Ultra is the best camera I used this year. It does a better job than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, Xiaomi 14 Ultra, Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Only the Find X7 Ultra comes close to the device, and it&apos;s annoying that two of the best camera phones of 2024 are limited to China.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="caAZbPMxXUHLYSz4K8NfZQ" name="vivo-x100-ultra-22.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/caAZbPMxXUHLYSz4K8NfZQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used dozens of phones with Vivo&apos;s Funtouch OS over the years, but the X100 Ultra comes with the brand&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based OriginOS instead, which it uses exclusively in China. There&apos;s quite a lot of differences between the two, and if anything, I think I prefer the OriginOS interface. It looks cleaner, and has an exhaustive feature-set.</p><p>The UI has better fluidity than Funtouch OS, and you get a great level of customizability. The notification pane is split into a Control Center and notification section, and there&apos;s no way to switch to a unified pane. The overview menu allows you to stack horizontally or vertically — similar to MIUI — and the app grid is somehow wider.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p5kn8ufSt8Q3beN9o8DaTR" name="vivo-x100-ultra-23.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p5kn8ufSt8Q3beN9o8DaTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like other Chinese-only devices, you don&apos;t get Google Play Services out of the box, but that can be easily addressed. Vivo has its own app store, and you can install the Play Store from there and go into the phone&apos;s settings to enable basic Google services. Doing so lets you sign in to the Play Store (you&apos;ll get a server issue otherwise), and then you can easily install apps just like any other device.</p><p>While there aren&apos;t many issues with OriginOS as a whole, notifications continue to be a problem. I guess this has something to do with the requisite Google hooks not being present, but all phones I use with Chinese skins have issues with notification management. I just don&apos;t get most notifications, and I have to manually go into an app to see whatever notifications I missed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ifSJQRWq5j9ZgXMG75n26S" name="vivo-x100-ultra-17.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ifSJQRWq5j9ZgXMG75n26S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X100 Ultra is also constrained in this area, and while it isn&apos;t as limiting as the Find X7 Ultra, I had plenty of instances where video calls or even regular calls — when using Google&apos;s Phone dialer — would trigger a notification. It got to a point where I had to switch to the bundled Vivo dialer so I wouldn&apos;t miss phone calls, but WhatsApp calls were always an issue.</p><p>That said, changing background memory settings to unrestricted made a difference in this regard, and there was only the occasional video call that went awry. Other than that, using the phone is similar to the global build.</p><p>Vivo rolled out software updates consistently to the X100 Ultra (I counted four updates), and the device will pick up four Android OS updates along with six years of security patches. While that&apos;s not as much as what Google and Samsung provide, it is adequate.</p>

<p>The standard X100 Pro is pretty great in its own right, and I recommend getting this instead of the X100 Ultra; it has terrific cameras, and takes great photos and videos in challenging situations. The design is nearly identical, and you get powerful hardware with a long-lasting battery. I used the X100 Pro alongside the X100 Ultra, and while the latter ultimately wins out on the camera front, the software hassle makes the X100 Pro the better choice globally.</p><p>The phone that comes closest to the X100 Ultra is its BBK sibling, the Find X7 Ultra, with that device also featuring a stunning design and outstanding cameras. Annoyingly, that device is also limited to China, and you can&apos;t buy it outside the country.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra is also good, and while its cameras are amazing, there are inconsistencies with the resultant photos and videos that&apos;s making me reconsider my recommendation. This hasn&apos;t been an issue in previous years, but the 14 Ultra just doesn&apos;t have the same consistency as other devices in this category.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x100-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>Vivo X100 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h2>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the phone with the best cameras</li><li>You want the best hardware currently available</li><li>You need excellent battery life and reliable charging</li><li>You want a vibrant OLED that's among the brightest around</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want hassle-free software</li><li>You need a phone with Google services pre-installed</li></ul>
<p>If I had to pick just one device as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phone of 2024</a>, it would be the X100 Ultra — Vivo did a fantastic job overall. The phone has a great design, one of the brightest OLED panels available today, and top-notch hardware. Battery life is among the best of any phone around, and 80W charging is reliable.</p><p>Where the X100 Ultra has an edge over other flagships is the cameras. The main camera is identical to what you get on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, Find X7 Ultra, and the X100 Pro, but the resultant images are marginally better thanks to Vivo&apos;s tuning efforts. The portrait camera is the best around, and there isn&apos;t another phone today that matches the X100 Ultra in this regard.</p><p>While that&apos;s great, the biggest limitation with the X100 Ultra is that it isn&apos;t available globally. Vivo needs to change its strategy in 2025 and bring the Ultra model to global markets — it&apos;s too good to be sold in just one country.</p>

<p>Rugged smartphone maker DOOGEE has just launched its latest model, the S200. This tough little device isn’t just built to last; it's also the first 5G smartphone in the DOOGEE S lineup.</p><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-phones">leading rugged smartphones</a> on the market, the DOOGEE S200 is built to handle harsh conditions. With its tough components and aerospace-grade aluminum body, it’s earned the MIL-STD-810H certification and IP69/IP69K ratings, making it resistant to water, dust, sand, and impacts. This means the phone has been put through rigorous drop tests to prove it can withstand just about anything.</p><p>The S200 sports a 6.72-inch 120Hz main display and a handy 1.32-inch rear screen that quietly shows you the time and other quick info. Its rear camera setup includes a 100MP sensor boosted by AI and Morpho Imaging tech, plus a 20MP night vision mode and the ability to shoot 4K video.</p><p>Doogee claims this rugged phone can take photos underwater at depths of up to 5 feet (1.5 meters), making it perfect for your aquatic escapades. Plus, with its AI doing all the heavy lifting on the settings, you can just point and shoot and pretend you're a professional photographer.</p><p>Armed with the MediaTek Dimensity 7050 processor, the S200 delivers performance that won’t make you want to throw it against the wall in frustration (though it can probably take that beating since it's a rugged device, after all).</p><p>It’s got Wi-Fi 6 for those who need speed and up to 32GB of RAM with 256GB of storage, so multitasking is as easy as pie. Its gigantic 10,100mAh battery supports 33W fast charging and reverse charging, meaning you can keep your phone alive all day.</p><p>The S200 is rocking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, so you know it’s got performance, stability, and energy efficiency on lock. It also comes with some privacy features like fingerprint recognition.</p><p>The device retails for £260 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DCSKGG6X?&linkCode=sl1&tag=tablet022-21" target="_blank">Amazon UK</a>, and DOOGEE is currently offering a sweet £70 discount. This deal is expected to make its way to Amazon.com by the end of October. You’ll also be able to snag it from the DOOGEE website and AliExpress.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Google TV Home panel is now available on more devices from various brands  like TCL and Hisense.</li><li>You can control your smart home devices right from your TV, adjusting lights, thermostats, and security cameras with just the remote.</li><li>Make sure to set up your compatible smart devices in the Google Home app to use the new Home panel.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google TV Home panel, first launched on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a>, is apparently now available on a wider range of Google TV devices from various brands.</p><p>Google’s long-awaited TV Streamer went on sale last month, along with some useful upgrades for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>. The big changes include easier smart home control, AI-created custom screensavers, and a new way to organize your content.</p><p>The new Home panel, in particular, lets you control <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-home-compatible-devices">smart home devices</a> right from your TV. You can adjust lights, tweak the thermostat, and check security cameras with just your remote. Plus, it gives you notifications from smart doorbells and lets you manage locks, plugs, and speakers—all without lifting a finger.</p><p>Basically, the Home panel gives you full control of all your smart home devices on the Google TV Streamer, but you can't assign these functions to specific buttons.</p><p>Alongside the market launch of its new streaming device, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">confirmed that the Home panel would roll out</a> to existing Google TV devices. Chromecast with Google TV recently got it through a public preview, and now more Google TV devices from brands like TCL, Hisense, Xiaomi, and others are picking up the feature too (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/19/google-tv-home-panel-widely-available/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/15158065#:~:text=Set%20up%20devices%20in%20the%20Google%20Home%20app" target="_blank">support page</a>, users need to set up their compatible smart devices through the Google Home app before they can use the new Home panel on their TV.</p><p>The Home panel appears in the upper right corner of the screen, giving users a clear snapshot of their smart home tech. From this panel, you can get a full view of your devices and dive into individual settings to make changes.</p><p>If the Home panel isn't showing up on your Google TV, try checking for updates to the Google TV Home app in the Play Store. To see if the Home panel is already operational, just hold the home button on your remote to pull up the quick settings, then look for the Google Home tile.</p>
