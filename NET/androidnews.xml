<p>Read more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">here</a>.</p><p>After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> launched in 2021, the Finnish company is back with the Oura Ring 4. While it may not look too different from the Gen 3 Horizon style, there are plenty of improvements underneath that make it a worthy upgrade. Thanks to a new all-titanium design, upgraded sensors, and a new Smart Sensing technology, the Oura Ring 4 is more accurate than its predecessor.</p><p>Improvements to automatic activity detection allow the ring to monitor heart rate, too. Instead of the five exercises you can manually track, this increases the number of activities with heart rate monitoring to about 40.</p><p>There have also been improvements to stress monitoring, menstrual tracking, and battery life. The ring can last up to eight days on a single charge, which isn&apos;t the longest battery life we&apos;ve seen on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a>, but it&apos;s still impressive.</p><p>With this comes an improved app experience, with a new UI and simpler navagation. There&apos;s also a new timeline feature that will provide a glanceable view of your day, such as your automatically tracked activities and other entries you can manually input. For Android users, Oura is finally launching its Labs experience, which allows users to try new features like the AI advisor and meal tracking.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 is available for preorder and will ship on October 15. It starts at $349, depending on the color, and comes in sizes from 4 to 15.</p>

This week at SDC 2024, Samsung revealed that the One UI 7 update will arrive alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series, meaning we can expect it sometime in early 2025.</p><p>It seems like quite a delay compared to recent years, with Samsung pushing major Android updates before the year&apos;s end. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, for example, started rolling out on Samsung phones in October 2023, not long after Pixel&apos;s got the update.</p><p>It&apos;s not clear why Samsung is pushing the update back, but the company did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">show off One UI 7</a> during its developer conference, revealing the many visual changes coming with the update. For example, there will be a separation between the notification shade and the quick settings panel, which will show up depending on which side of the phone you swipe down from. There are also some changes that make it easier to use phones with one hand, such as the placement of the search bar in the app drawer at the bottom of the display.</p><p>But while we have to wait longer for stable One UI 7, Samsung also revealed that the beta will be available before the end of the year, meaning there will still be a chance to try it out before it reaches everyone. We hope you&apos;re patient!</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-codename-sooner-launch-speculation"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Android 15 isn&apos;t even out yet, but we&apos;re already getting some information about the next version of the OS. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-codename-3486221/">Android Authority</a> dove into some code and revealed that Google may be changing up the Android codename a bit by starting back at the beginning of the alphabet, giving Android 16 the codename "Baklava."</p><p>While it sticks to the dessert theme, Android 15 is codenamed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-dessert-codename-revealed">Vanilla Ice Cream</a>," meaning we would still have a few letters left before having gone through the full alphabet, more or less.</p><p>But beyond the new codename, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-release-date-rumor-3486336/">Android Authority</a> also discovered references to the Android 16 release window, which may point to the update launching in Q2 of 2025. If this is the case, it would be much easier than normal, as major Android releases usually roll out in the second half of the year. Android 15 is already seemingly behind schedule a bit, so it would be quite surprising if Google pushed Android 16 in the Spring, although it would coincide with Google I/O.</p><p>And given Samsung&apos;s delayed Android 15 update, it would mean the company would have some catching up to do. For now, we&apos;ll have to wait and see if this release window pans out.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/is-verizon-down-for-you-youre-not-alone"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>This week, in the wake of Hurricane Helene&apos;s devastation, Verizon experienced a massive outage that left many people without cell service for nearly an entire day. Problems started around 10 a.m. ET, with Verizon addressing the outage on its official X account hours later, stating that it was working on identifying and fixing the issue.</p><p>Hours after that, Verizon said its engineers were making progress on restoring its network, which was eventually fully restored just after 7 p.m. that same day.</p>
<p>The outage came at a very inconvenient time, as many people on the East Coast were no doubt relying on the network to contact emergency services or their loved ones in the aftermath of the hurricane.</p><p>Fortunately, as Android Central&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">Jerry Hildenbrand pointed out</a>, there were other options affected users could rely on, such as "disaster roaming" and even satellite communication on phones that support the feature. However, he stressed that these features were more important than ever in times like this, and hopefully we&apos;ll see more phones support satellite communication.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsung-lenovo-debut-chromebooks-google-update-details"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>On Tuesday (Oct. 1), Google unveiled two new Chromebooks, including a detachable from Lenovo and a Chromebook Plus model from Samsung. Android Central&apos;s Andrew Myrick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-2024samsung-lenovo-chromebooks-hands-on">went hands-on with both</a>.</p><p>The new Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 features an 11-inch display 2K display and comes with a keyboard/kickstand combination. It&apos;s powered by a MediaTek Kompanio 838 chip, which unfortunately makes it ineligible for the Chromebook Plus branding but comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Still, users should have plenty of power to work with, and the device will be available this month starting at $349.<br></p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s new Galaxy Chromebook Plus is a bit more on the high-end side, powered by an Intel Core 3 100U with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The device features a 15.6-inch OLED and is touted as the "thinnest Chromebook Plus ever." The laptop is the first to feature Google&apos;s new Quick Insert Key, which opens a drop-down menu with access to various tools such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">Help Me Write</a>. And while this new key is currently only available on Samsung&apos;s new laptop, others will be able to access the functionality using the <strong>Launcher Key + F </strong>shortcut.</p><p>The Galaxy Chromebook Plus will be available in October for $799.</p>
<p>Lastly, Google announced several new features heading to ChromeOS machines, including an on-screen "Chat with Gemini" button, a "Welcome Recap" screen that will offer suggestions on what users should do based on their last session, a new Focus mode, and more. Acer Chromebook models will pick up a number of new AI features, followed by other Chromebook machines in the coming months.</p>

Outside of Black Friday, Amazon Prime Days are when you will find some of the best prices on the things you&apos;ve been looking for and even the things you had no idea you wanted or needed.</p><p>The temptation to buy is going to be high. The whole experience is designed to be that way, and with pressure on tech websites to point consumers to the best deals, it&apos;s going to be everywhere. There is no escaping Amazon this week unless you turn off your internet.</p>

<p>Not everything is bad about Amazon Prime deal days, and I don&apos;t mean to sound like it is. You are probably in need of something, especially something tech-related, and there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;ll find it on sale this week. I need some rechargeable flashlight batteries for my nighttime mischief, for example, and I know I&apos;ll find a set on sale to buy at Amazon. </p><p>I also know that while I look for batteries, I&apos;ll see a gazillion other things designed to catch my eye, so I think about buying all of them. I will probably resist that temptation for the most part, and I&apos;m here to help you.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember is that Amazon and other online retailers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ftc-amazon-monopolist-lawsuit">track your internet habits</a> almost as much as Google does. It especially knows everything you do while visiting its website; it knows what you buy, what you "save for later," what you look at and don&apos;t buy, and how long you spend looking at every item you click on. </p><p>This builds a profile so the company can show you exactly what it thinks you can be enticed into buying, especially during a time like Amazon Prime Day. Honestly, this can be good, too. Not having to wade through items you have zero interest in is helpful, and it makes it easier to find what you want to find. </p><p>You&apos;re going to see things you were not planning on buying at prices that grab your attention—lots of them. It&apos;s helpful to know what you&apos;re looking for and what else you might be interested in, and try to stick to those items until you see if buying something extra is in your budget.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2046px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="A4fRHnJoXJddm7j9ebUgVR" name="USB-C-chargers-Aukey-Ravpower-Oneplus-Samsung.jpg" alt="USB-C chargers from Aukey, Ravpower, Oneplus, and Samsung" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A4fRHnJoXJddm7j9ebUgVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2046" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Only you know what you can afford to buy and what you want. Every website on the internet will tell you about stuff that&apos;s on sale and why buying it is a good idea. It&apos;s usually true—if an item is something everyone loves and it&apos;s at a low price, buying it can be a good decision. But only <em>you</em> can make that decision.</p><p>I might tell you why I think you should buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> (I will be). I&apos;ll tell you why I spent my own money on one and that I think it&apos;s the best phone for the money available. Don&apos;t buy a Pixel 8a unless you want or need a Pixel 8a, though, no matter what I say. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Articles like this</a> are meant to help you decide if you know you need something but are unsure which to buy. </p>
<p>Install a tool that helps you track prices, or use a website that does the same. Unfortunately, slowly ramping up the price of an item on the lead-up to a big sale day and then slashing it for the sale is too common. It means you&apos;re not really saving much money, even if the listing says you&apos;re getting it at 40% off. I wish Amazon, in particular, would crack down on the sellers who do it.</p><p>You usually don&apos;t have to worry about more established companies doing this. Amazon or Samsung aren&apos;t going to try this one, for example. But a tool like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.joinhoney.com/">Honey</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> is something you should use before you click the buy button.</p>
<p>Amazon is not the only game in town. The company may have the trademark on "Prime Day," but everyone is going to get in on the action because every other company knows you&apos;re online and shopping.</p><p>Great places to look for tech deals are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-4693586370059157921&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals">Walmart</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1209067442414402478&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Felectronics%2Ftop-deals%2Fpcmcat1563299784494.c&article_name=Prime%20Day%20returns%20in%20just%20ONE%20WEEK%20%E2%80%94%20see%20our%20FAQ%20and%20some%20handpicked%20discounts%20ahead%20of%20Big%20Deal%20Days%202024&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fprime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Best Buy</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=44583&u1=ac-us-1051954877895106511&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2F">Newegg</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/">B&H Photo</a>. All these places have a good reputation, and I&apos;ve actually purchased items from them without any issues. Comparison shopping, especially during something like Prime Day, is an excellent way to save money.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5057px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R" name="google-pixel-8a-blue-with-flowers-03.jpg" alt="The blue Google Pixel 8a on a tea tray with blue hydrangeas above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5057" height="2848" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cheapest thing isn&apos;t always the best deal. In fact, buying the cheapest thing in any category is <em>usually</em> not a good deal. Building and selling a quality product isn&apos;t cheap. Since there&apos;s no tactful way to say it, cheap junk is going to cost less than something worth buying. You will not get your money&apos;s worth when you buy cheap junk.</p><p>This is especially true when it comes to tech accessories. My wife loves her <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch</a>, and it never leaves her wrist. She has an envelope with 10 watch straps in it that she can&apos;t wear because they turn her wrist different colors. Those watch straps were cheaper than others, but they were also junk. Don&apos;t buy junk because it&apos;s cheap.</p><p>Reviews can help but know that a lot of the Amazon reviews you see are just more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ftc-fight-against-ai-scammers-why-it-matters">junk written by AI bots</a> and mean nothing. If you&apos;ve never heard of the brand, Google it and see what you find. Always.</p><p>Some cheap things are worth buying. Most aren&apos;t.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nmj9QzsAtKafiFf76tzvDH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-bezel.jpeg" alt="A close-up side-view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, focused on the rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nmj9QzsAtKafiFf76tzvDH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, remember you don&apos;t have to buy anything. All of this stuff will still be there come the week after next, and though it might not be on sale, you can still pick up anything you like anytime you like.</p><p>There&apos;s another potentially bigger sale coming on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-black-friday">Black Friday</a>, too. There&apos;s no guarantee something will be cheaper then, but it may be worth waiting for if you can.</p><p>I hope you walk away from another Prime Day sale happy with yourself and anything you bought. With a little bit of planning and thinking before you click a buy button, it&apos;s easier.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly starting a limited test in Search that could aid in user safety when surfing the web.</p><p>A small number of results in Google Search have been spotted with a familiar blue checkmark beside the name of a given website. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261877/google-search-verified-checkmarks-experiment-feature">The Verge</a>, Google is considering bringing a version of BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) to Search. The publication discovered that hovering over the blue mark delivers a brief explanation.</p><p>The test marker reads, "this icon is being shown because Google&apos;s signals suggest that this business is the business that it says it is." Google then backs out of any responsibility regarding the "reliability" of said business.</p><p>The publication reached out to Google and received the following statement from a spokesperson: "... we are currently running a small experiment showing checkmarks next to certain businesses on Google."</p><p>So far, this test&apos;s appearance is limited to not just users, but also websites. The report states the checkmarks only appear for high-profile websites like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when/if Google will roll this out for <em>everyone</em>. However, we have Gmail to look at as a baseline.</p>

<p>Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-gets-blue-verification-checkmarks-to-prevent-phishing">the BIMI indicators in Gmail</a> last year, which were symbols that actually bear weight. The markers are designed to give users peace of mind when receiving emails. Only those with the blue marker were verified as the real deal as the company looked to combat phishing and other malicious attacks. The BIMI system ensures that the sender owns the website it claims and the logo featured.</p><p>These are aspects explained in Gmail and echoed in this recent Search results test.</p><p>BIMI&apos;s arrival in Search could help Google reduce scams and other attacks, something it sought legal charges for in 2023. Last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-sues-bard-scammers">the company sued scammers</a> attempting to harm users through social media and ads. The ads and posts stated that users would&apos;ve received Google Bard access (remember Bard?). Unfortunately, those who interacted with the fake download buttons were exposed to malware and other viruses.</p>

<p>Much to the chagrin of some of those in the Android space, Apple has largely been considered the "measuring stick" for both hardware and software. Arguments have been made that the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei, and Samsung, among others surpassed Apple in the hardware department long ago. </p><p>The same can&apos;t be said about the software, despite Apple locking down iOS and iPadOS in the most frustrating ways. However, after seeing what&apos;s happened in 2024, I can&apos;t help but wonder if Apple lost its touch.</p><p>Over the past year, Apple has entered a new product category with the Vision Pro headset while releasing refreshes of practically every other device in its lineup. Plus, we&apos;re expecting at least one more announcement as rumors suggest Apple has an event planned this month to unveil new Macs and hopefully a refreshed iPad Mini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-iphone-15-pro-max-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple has proven that companies don&apos;t need to reinvent the hardware wheel when releasing a refreshed device. For instance, the only major differences between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and iPhone 16 Pro are a new "Camera Control" button and bezels that are ever-so-slightly slimmer than before. </p><p>The majority of the focus from Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16-series-has-me-convinced-apple-needs-a-foldable">iPhone 16</a> event was showcasing the various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-outsourcing-openai-feels-unapple-but-unsurprising">AI-powered features</a> slated to come to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. There&apos;s just one problem though — none of the exciting features are actually available yet. So basically, Apple just took the same approach that we used to lambast other companies in that it announced features that won&apos;t actually be available at launch. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cwzcPjjSGaom2cFv4uLqNh" name="iphone-16-pro-max-render-showing-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="iPhone 16 Pro in hand glowing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cwzcPjjSGaom2cFv4uLqNh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hardly any of these features were available with the final release of iOS 18, which arrived alongside the iPhone 16 series. Instead, it seems that Apple will be rolling out features in waves, starting with iOS 18.1. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/22/apple-intelligence-features-timing/">MacRumors </a>laid out the rumors of when to expect features to arrive pretty well, and here&apos;s how things are looking:</p>

<p>If Apple sticks to this rumored timeline, it means that the company&apos;s latest device won&apos;t have all of the new features until it&apos;s already been on the market for six months. There&apos;s also the potential of even more frustration as you can&apos;t watch TV for more than an hour without seeing an iPhone commercial touting Apple Intelligence. </p>

<p>Just a little bit of good old-fashioned deception because we know Apple doesn&apos;t want to miss out on the holiday shopping season. </p><p>While delaying features isn&apos;t great, it&apos;s not as bad as what iPad Pro owners have had to endure. Apple introduced and released the M4-powered iPad Pro back in May 2024. This remains the only device in Apple&apos;s lineup to be powered by the M4 chip, which is likely to be rectified later in October. </p><p>The problem is that iPadOS 18 was released in mid-September, and the update was removed for those with the M4 iPad Pro the next day. Some found that after installing the update, the iPad Pro would essentially be turned into a very expensive metal and glass brick. It wasn&apos;t until today (October 4) that Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18-release-notes">released</a> iPadOS 18.0.1, which should include the fix for whatever the original issue was. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK" name="ipad-pro-2024-imore.jpg" alt="2024 iPad Pro M4 on desk with Magic Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gerald Lynch / iMore)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s more than two weeks without being able to use Apple&apos;s latest software with its more powerful (and expensive) iPad model. As someone who has an M4 iPad Pro, this has been one of the few times that I&apos;m thankful to be on the "beta train," as I haven&apos;t come across any of those problems. </p><p>Originally, I thought this was rather unprecedented for Apple, and then I remembered the iPhone 14 launch. This is when Apple made the move to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">eSIM only</a> in the U.S., but the company had to rush out a day-one software update as many were unable to actually register an eSIM. So, I guess things have been out of whack for longer than I thought.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-camera-2.jpg" alt="Camera app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m not ignorant of what&apos;s happened in the Android space, but I would argue that at least Samsung and even Google have leapfrogged Apple when it comes to updates. Both companies announced a plethora of new AI features for its respective devices, and the majority of those features were available as soon as you could download the update. The most obvious exception to this is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lesson-learned-with-google-zoom-enhance-feature">Zoom Enhance</a>, a feature Google announced for the Pixel 8 Pro, but it didn&apos;t actually arrive until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. </p><p>But as far as hardware goes, I think Apple&apos;s basically run out of ideas. First, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">Action Button</a> was added, and now we have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">Camera Control</a> button. Besides that, how much more does Apple think it can slim down the bezels and use that as a selling point? Oh, and I forgot that the non-Pro iPhones now have a rearranged camera module. Woo-hoo. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LSsPjMuKnyq2HWhrp8LD9C" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Fold-2-vs-Honor-Magic-v3-09.jpg" alt="Comparing the TECNO Phantom V Fold 2 with the Honor Magic V3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LSsPjMuKnyq2HWhrp8LD9C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Apple is sticking to the slab design, almost every other Android phone maker is either working on or has released a foldable phone. Some, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola</a>, have stuck to the flip phone form factor, while the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Xiaomi</a>, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Tecno</a> have multiple foldable phone options. </p><p>I have no doubt that Apple already has a foldable iPhone prototype, regardless of whether it flips or folds. The problem is that rumors indicate Apple continues to push back the release of a foldable device. Back in 2022, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-apple-waiting-too-long-to-make-a-foldable-phone">we pondered</a> whether Apple was already waiting too long, and currently, the rumor mill points to 2027 as the year that we&apos;ll finally see Apple get into the game. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HzjSRkNW25JJUjuQLCszCW" name="apple-foldable-hero.jpg" alt="Holding a mockup of a potential iPhone foldable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HzjSRkNW25JJUjuQLCszCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can only surmise that this is because Apple wants to do everything it can to avoid the backlash that other phone makers have seen with folding screens that break unexpectedly. Even in 2024, it&apos;s still a problem that occasionally crops up with new devices and is more common with older models. But at some point, when is Apple just going to take the leap?</p><p>Taking a leap is exactly what Apple did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-pro">Vision Pro</a>, its first foray into the world of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a>. Supposedly, this is meant to be Apple CEO Tim Cook&apos;s "legacy," and while that may be true, the current iteration is simply out of reach for many, especially at a time when you can walk into practically any big box store and walk out with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest headset</a> and don&apos;t need to sell a kidney to do so. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-front-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Vision Pro was always going to be quite expensive, not just because of the R&D that went into it but also because of the hardware and technology it packs. For reference, the Vision Pro features a per-eye resolution of 3660 x 3200, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> is equipped with a per-eye resolution of 2064 x 2208. Plus, Apple relies on micro-OLED displays, whereas Meta&apos;s headset utilizes LCD displays. </p><p>I know it&apos;s not really fair to compare a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/october-prime-day-meta-quest-deals-2024-should-you-wait-for-big-deal-days-or-buy-now">$500 headset</a> with one that <em>starts </em>at $3,500. But that&apos;s part of the point that I&apos;m trying to make, as Apple is already so far behind in its appeal to the general consumer that I don&apos;t know if future iterations will be able to capture the masses. </p><p>The longer Apple waits to release a foldable phone, the more likely it will end up being far too expensive compared to the competition. I don&apos;t have a crystal ball, and we have no idea what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone market</a> will look like three years from now. But it&apos;s 2024, and we already have tri-foldable phones with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei Mate XT</a>. Plus, companies have been working on phones with rollable displays, although I think those will be even less popular than the current crop of foldables. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Hf5aoDyaQK5sonvTkf2Wib" name="huawei-mate-xt-tri-fold-screen-unfolded.jpeg" alt="The Huawei Mate XT tri-fold offers a 10-2.inch display experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hf5aoDyaQK5sonvTkf2Wib.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1406" height="791" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of me thinks that Apple is just coasting as much as it can. The company probably didn&apos;t expect to see the explosion in the popularity of AI, so the "brain trust" came up with ideas and announced them, even though they were nowhere near being ready for primetime. </p><p>Another aspect is that Tim Cook has been CEO of Apple for more than 13 years, and there are rumblings that he may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/who-is-john-ternus-the-man-most-likely-to-replace-tim-cook-as-apples-ceo-when-he-steps-down-13769379.html">eyeing retirement</a>. With much of the focus being put on trying to leave a lasting impression in the form of a hardware release, I can&apos;t help but wonder if we won&apos;t see anything revolutionary again until after someone else takes up the mantle. </p><p>As someone who spent time as an iPhone fanboy before pivoting to Android (and now dual-wielding), I&apos;m just kind of disappointed. There are still some things I think an iPhone and iPad offer over their Android equivalents, but that list has never been smaller. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s Developer Conference (SDC 2024) highlighted a few upcoming additions to improve its smart home ecosystem.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-celebrates-10-years-of-sdc-and-spotlights-ai-based-innovation-at-sdc24#:~:text=debugging%20and%20profiling.-,SmartThings,-Takes%20New%20Leap">Newsroom post</a>, SDC 2024 held a brief glimpse into Samsung&apos;s upcoming "Home Insight" feature for SmartThings (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/smartthings-home-insight-ai-suggestions/">SamMobil</a>e). The update is said to arrive "this month" with ways to promote better optimization for your smart home devices. Samsung states Home Insight will turn off idle devices "at specific times" or if the user is away from home.</p><p>Home Insight is also able to collect and analyze data such as device usage, history, and other "home statistics." All of this likely contributes to its optimization features for a seamless smart home. The publication spotted during the SDC 2024 keynote that Home Insight can remind users to turn off a device accidentally left active.</p><p>The conference teased that Home Insight can also leverage dates in your calendar, such as birthdays, and suggest fun activities using your devices.</p><p>Moreover, all of Samsung&apos;s devices with a screen will run SmartThings Hub and receive Edge AI technology. This software will "embed" AI into a consumer&apos;s devices for a better experience and usability.</p><p>Samsung highlighted its partnership with Kohler, which will help monitor a user&apos;s water usage within SmartThings. Additionally, the software&apos;s Door Lock is set to debut in Digital Home Key in Samsung Wallet in 2025.</p><p>The company teased further integration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-underrated-feature-device-files-upload">YouTube Music</a> during SDC 2024. According to SamMobile, users can pair lights connected to SmartThings to a set of songs from YouTube Music. The integration will reportedly pair well with Philips Hue lights, Wiz, Yeelight, and Lifx.</p>

<p>With so much ahead for Samsung&apos;s SmartThings, the company will build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/samsung-smartthings-matter-1-2-support-update">upon a previous major update</a> from this summer. In July, the company rolled out an update that let users pair refrigerators, air conditioners, dishwashers, and laundry washing machines to SmartThings.</p><p>The update included "Shareable Routines," a new Hub Manager introduced to the app. Users could share routines that involved a singular device or multiple devices in a home with others. These routines can be easily handed out via a QR code for family members and guests.</p><p>Specifically for device pairing, those updates concerned Matter 1.2-ready smart home devices.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 ups the ante with serious advancements in baseband security, building on years of solid protection.</li><li>Exploiting baseband firmware flaws could let attackers break in, gain control, and even install hidden backdoors, putting user data in danger.</li><li>Google’s tech updates, like the upgraded Bound Sanitizer and integer overflow sanitizer, help block harmful code and ensure accurate calculations.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google breaks down how it keeps the Pixel 9&apos;s baseband security locked tight, basically claiming that it&apos;s now a fortress against modem vulnerabilities.</p><p>For years, Pixel devices have been equipped with solid baseband security. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> takes it up a notch, showcasing some serious advancements in baseband protection, as noted in Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/pixel-proactive-security-cellular-modems.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>The baseband is a weak spot for malicious attacks, so it’s been a major focus for Google’s security team. </p><p>Google points out that exploiting flaws in the baseband firmware could let attackers break into device security, gain higher privileges, run arbitrary code, and install hidden backdoors, putting user data at risk.</p><p>With the Pixel 9, the company&apos;s security team has hit a turning point, completely revamping the baseband architecture.</p><p>Google mentioned cases where attackers use cloned base stations to send manipulated network packets that can be executed from different locations. These attacks are a big threat to smartphone security, especially since the baseband is more vulnerable within the device&apos;s attack surface.</p><p>However, users often overlook the complex software that powers smartphones, Google pointed out, making baseband security a top priority that shouldn&apos;t come at the cost of performance.</p><p>While Google&apos;s updates might sound too technical, they&apos;re all aimed at keeping users safe from all sorts of nasty attacks. One key improvement is the upgraded Bound Sanitizer, which blocks unauthorized code from accessing the phone&apos;s memory, making it much harder for attackers to run harmful code.</p><p>Plus, Google has also improved the integer overflow sanitizer to ensure numbers are read correctly, stopping attackers from messing with the phone&apos;s internal calculations.</p><p>The search giant has beefed up security even more by adding stack canaries—kind of like digital tripwires that catch malicious code trying to sneak in. This tweak helps keep things on track by restricting code to specific paths, making it way harder for hackers to mess with how info flows inside the device.</p><p>Lastly, Google has upgraded Auto-initialized stack variables, allowing the device to make better use of all available memory. This change lowers the risk of hackers exploiting leftover data to leak sensitive information.</p><p>Even if the tech lingo sounds complicated, the gist of Google&apos;s updates is a big step up in baseband security for the Pixel 9, cementing its status as being among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android smartphones</a> on the market.</p>

<ul><li>At SDC 2024, Samsung had a Galaxy S24 Ultra on deck that rocked its upcoming One UI 7 (Android 15) software.</li><li>From the demo, it was discovered that the notifications and Quick Settings panel will be separated, giving users a full view of both areas.</li><li>One UI 7 is also shifting the search bar to the bottom of the app drawer UI.</li><li>Samsung confirmed One UI 7 will arrive in 2025 alongside the Galaxy S25 and the beta is likely to begin "by the end of" 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung had more in store during its Developers Conference this week, which involved a close look at One UI 7&apos;s changes.</p><p>One UI 7 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>) has been rumored to feature a "major" shift in Samsung&apos;s software design all year. Images captured by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/one-ui-7-simple-impactful-and-emotive-ui-changes-explored/">SammyGuru</a> show Samsung&apos;s teasers of a few One UI 7 changes that bring the OS into an Apple-like world (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/04/samsung-one-ui-7-ios-copy-preview/">9to5Google</a>). Kicking off those changes is the Quick Settings menu, which offers a much curvier appearance with pill-shaped options.</p><p>It seems Samsung is looking to feature smaller, fatter sliders for your device&apos;s brightness level. The publication noted in Samsung&apos;s demo that you can move the "blocks" featured on the updated Quick Settings menu. Moreover, the icons in the larger "block" with airplane mode, flashlight, etc., can be swapped out and customized further.</p><p>The Korean OEM is moving toward more customization with One UI 7 and moving the options/icons within blocks would give users agency over <em>how </em>their settings should look.</p>

<p>Another sharp change is the notification panel. The upcoming OS update separates a user&apos;s alerts from the Quick Settings panel. What was shown during SDC 2024 was a panel that stacks your notifications in a pill-shaped design with an arrow to expand for more information. Much like the Quick Settings panel (and other screens), the notification center has a low depth of field.</p><p>The time and date are listed at the top left with a "settings" button and "clear" on the bottom. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRM91R0EveE&ab_channel=SamMobile">SamMobile</a> went into detail about this separation, revealing that One UI 7 lets users swipe down the left side of their display for notifications, leaving the right side for Quick Settings.</p><p>Some other smaller changes in One UI 7 include a "Side button" options page redesign. Users will find options unified under the "Double Press" and "Press and hold" choices. The app drawer has picked up a welcome change as its search bar drops to the bottom of the UI.</p><p>What this early glimpse from SDC 2024 does is (essentially) confirm many of the rumors about One UI 7. It seems Samsung is truly moving toward a more HyperOS (Xiaomi) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-one-ui-7-might-take-a-big-page-out-of-apples-ios-playbook">iOS-inspired design</a> with its Android 15 skin, as evidenced by the Quick Settings panel changes, notifications, and other refreshed elements.</p><p>While several aspects of One UI 7 are changing, and likely looping in more Galaxy AI, we&apos;re still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">staring at a massive delay</a>. It was reported that Samsung was still holding internal discussions about the software&apos;s features and working through "stability problems" in September. However, Samsung confirmed One UI 7 (Android 15) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">won&apos;t arrive until 2025</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s expected to drop alongside the Galaxy S25 series, marking an extreme departure from the company&apos;s typical update cadence. Despite that, the company is expected to begin its One UI 7  beta "before the year ends."</p>

Go pick up the Galaxy Watch 7 right now, for instance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML"><strong>you&apos;ll score up to 20% off your purchase</strong></a>, no strings attached. This is the biggest discount that the flagship smartwatch has EVER received, and all you have to do is hit that Add to Cart button. Don&apos;t mind a last-gen device? 2023&apos;s Galaxy Watch 6 is also receiving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C797946T"><strong>a record-smashing 43% discount</strong></a> at Amazon. </p><p>It&apos;s unusual to see such major discounts before Big Deal Days kicks off, and it makes me wonder if the smartwatches are going to sell out quickly when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-early-samsung-galaxy-deals-phones-tablets-and-more">Prime Day Samsung deals</a> officially go live next week. Needless to say, if you&apos;d rather be safe than sorry, I&apos;d place your order as soon as possible. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Epic Games is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-sues-google-and-samsung-anti-competitive-case">suing Google again</a> along with Samsung, claiming that unfair practices make it hard to get exposure to its third-party software offerings. In this claim, Epic takes issue with Samsung&apos;s Auto Blocker feature, which stops the installation of software that is not from official trusted sources. Specifically, Epic claims that it&apos;s anti-competitive that auto-blocker is on by default and that Google strong-armed Samsung into making it that way.</p><p>This feels very much like the last time Epic sued Google, claiming the company was anti-competitive and abusing monopoly power. That&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">a lawsuit Epic won</a>, even if it didn&apos;t have the results Epic had hoped for. What&apos;s not being mentioned is that this all stems from the fact that Epic doesn&apos;t want to pay Google (or Apple) fees to process payments and transactions.</p>
<p>I don&apos;t blame Epic for not wanting to pay 30% of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-finalizes-order-requiring-fortnite-maker-epic-games-pay-245-million-tricking-users-making">mountain of money it makes</a> from players when it thinks it could find a way to keep that cash for itself. I also want companies to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-its-good-that-companies-like-google-face-antitrust-cases">hold Google accountable</a> and challenge all of its policies anytime there is even a hint of anti-competitive behavior. </p><p>I&apos;m just tired of this particular case because one side is as bad as the other.</p>
<p>Google says it had nothing to do with Samsung&apos;s decision to build and deploy the auto-blocker feature. I&apos;ve reached out to see if Google has more to say but in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DaveKSecure/status/1840925172691583003">statement posted to X</a> Google Security and privacy team member David Kleidermacher says:</p><p><em>"Epic’s latest lawsuit is a meritless and dangerous move. Google did not request that Samsung create their Auto Blocker feature. </em></p><p><em>While Android allows sideloading, Google and the security community have warned users for years about the real risks associated with downloading apps directly from the web. In the U.S., federal agencies, NGOs, and fintech associations have guidance underscoring this issue. </em></p><p><em>Governments around the world have requested additional solutions to help further protect users from the fraud, theft, and abuse from sideloaded apps that are causing real harm to people’s lives. That’s why Google offers its own safety features such as Google Play Protect, which checks for harmful apps on a user’s device, regardless of where the app was downloaded. </em></p><p><em>Android device makers are free to innovate and design additional safety features for their devices. To make this about access to a game is deliberately misleading; this is about user safety. And Epic’s lawsuit puts their corporate interests above user protections."</em></p>

<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeny replied:</p><p><em>"The 21 steps required to install Epic Games Store on new Samsung Android devices are full of intentional dead ends and misleading scare screens characterizing Epic as an “unknown” source (y’all know us) and our software as dangerous (y’all know it’s not).</em></p><p><em>Windows and MacOS demonstrate multiple successful and proportionate approaches to blocking malware. None involve blocking safe software from reputable companies or portraying known software as unknown as Google and Samsung are doing. Google’s scheme is dishonest and misleading."</em></p>
<p>Obviously, social media is no place for meaningful discourse, and this is just another back-and-forth of two companies trying to one-up with each other.</p><p>I have no idea if Google asked Samsung to implement the Auto Blocker feature. I do know that Google allows phone makers to implement security solutions if they want to do so.</p><p>Saying the steps to disable the Auto Blocker feature are difficult is subjective. Trying to claim Epic is a trusted source in the security sense is absurd (Samsung can not verify Epic&apos;s code), and claiming that Windows and macOS don&apos;t block "safe" companies from installing unsigned system-level code without user interaction is even more absurd.</p><p>I can&apos;t take either statement as proof of anything and neither should you. That&apos;s because every company involved has shown it will do and say anything to sway public opinion. </p><p>So here&apos;s what we actually know.</p>
<ul><li>Having trust doesn't mean "y'all know us." It means being able to verify in-house that the code is doing exactly what it claims to do and nothing more. Instances of software overstepping and allowing potentially problematic behavior happen every day and even <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/epic-games-first-fortnite-installer-allowed-hackers-download-install-silently">happened to Epic with this very same application</a>. No company can call another company a trusted source without a clear and specific arrangement.</li><li>There are a lot of good reasons to want to install software on your phone that didn't come from Google's Play Store. Doing so shouldn't be automatic but it can be confusing if you aren't willing to follow the right steps.</li><li>Samsung is allowed to add extra software security features to Android and there is nothing wrong with the Auto Blocker feature. Not enabling it by default would mean that to be protected would require a process "<em>full of intentional dead ends and misleading scare screens</em>" so making it enabled by default is a fair decision.</li><li>None of this would be an issue if the Epic Games transactions went through Google Play, but Epic would be forced to pay money to Google for every transaction.</li></ul>

<p>None of the companies involved want to infect your phone with malware or wish any ill will on you in any way. They want you to be happy with your purchase (whether that be a phone or an app) and be willing to buy again.</p><p>Mobile operating systems are not like the ones you might use on a desktop, and anyone trying to equate them is being silly. You can install an "app store" on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-convert-windows-laptop-chromebook">Windows computer</a> because that app store isn&apos;t doing anything critical with system files; if it wants even rudimentary access to certain folders it requires you to approve it. MacOS is the same, and Linux distributions are even worse/better when it comes to permissions. What works on Windows does not work on Android, and it&apos;s time we all stopped thinking like that.</p>
