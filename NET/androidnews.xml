It's not because I need one, but it's always good to have one, just in case. For nearly two years, I've relied on an Anker Nano Power Bank (A1259), which has been very reliable. Now, there's a newer version, and I finally got my hands on it.</p><p>There are several notable differences between the two chargers, ranging from design to cable, charging speed, capabilities, and more. Overall, it's a fantastic charger that I would recommend to anyone, especially if you can find a great deal on it. Here's what I like and what could be improved (which, frankly, isn't much).</p><p>Enjoy our content?

It's not too bulky, and it has a built-in USB-C cable that acts as a loop, making it easy to carry around. It's a pretty strong cable, and in my years of owning the charger, the cable has never faltered.</p><p>The new Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) switches things up quite a bit, and I'm not fully convinced that I like it. It's still relatively small, but it features a bulkier design than before. It's not quite something you can slide into a pocket like the previous model, and it feels a bit like a small brick or a large rock in my hand, weighing roughly 231.3g, whereas the older model weighs just 215g.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="VzdR5mdD6fegjNxxvskDcb" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1259" alt="The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1259) USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VzdR5mdD6fegjNxxvskDcb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1259) USB-C cable. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Gcs5wsYWdQtsm3iG5x7oCc" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1638-1" alt="A hand pulling the Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) retractable USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gcs5wsYWdQtsm3iG5x7oCc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) has a retractable USB-C cable that hides in the body. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>And while I may not care too much about the new design, there's actually a good reason for it: the new, retractable USB-C cable no longer functions as a loop and is instead hidden inside the charger. This way, not only do you get a built-in cable, but it's also much longer than the previous model when fully extended, at 2.3 feet, making it much more useful.</p><p>Anker says that it weighs about the same as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-max-review">iPhone 17 Pro Max</a>, which is the heaviest model of the lineup. It's not terrible, but it's a bit of a surprise coming from the smaller and lighter A1259.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3942px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ieak25cPHD3ee6VREXUb6c" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1638-2" alt="The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) with the cable fully extended" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ieak25cPHD3ee6VREXUb6c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3942" height="2217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a neat design that is starting to appear in more power banks, but the downside is that it makes it bulkier. Frankly, it's a fair trade-off, and Anker claims it's still 16% smaller than other models with retractable cables.</p><p>Additionally, the newer Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) still has a loop, although it's a more traditional one attached to one corner of the device.</p><h2 id="faster-charging-same-large-battery-2">Faster charging, same large battery</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="guc84Mqzqoub95GS8XYufc" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1638-4" alt="The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) charging a Motorola Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guc84Mqzqoub95GS8XYufc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While both chargers feature 10,000mAh batteries, the A1638 model supports speeds of up to 45W. This is great, because phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> top out at 45W wired charging. While there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> with even faster charging speeds, the speed bump should still prove useful for these phones.</p><p>As an example, I've been using it to charge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, which supports a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-charging-speed">68W charging speed</a>. With a 100W+ wall charger, the Razr’s 4,700mAh battery tops up in just 40 minutes. Here's how quickly the phone charges from 0% to 100% using both the older and newer Anker Nano portable chargers:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Anker Power Bank</p></th><th  ><p>A1638</p></th><th  ><p>A1259</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>0-50%</p></td><td  ><p>22 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>30 minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>0-100%</p></td><td  ><p>49 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>1h 5m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Remaining</p></td><td  ><p>49%</p></td><td  ><p>42%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see, the newer model charges the Razr battery in less than an hour, while I have to wait over an hour with the older model. It's not a huge difference, but any charging speed improvements are welcome, especially when dealing with larger batteries.</p><p>Both models also differed in the amount of capacity they had left after providing the Razr with a full charge, with a difference of 7%. Of course, this could also be due to the age of the older charger, resulting in a reduced capacity. Therefore, don't expect two full charges on phones with larger batteries, but you will still get a decent second charge.</p><p>Of course, you can charge multiple devices at once, which is also convenient, but the charging speed is significantly reduced, especially when charging three devices simultaneously. Therefore, I would only utilize this option as a last resort.</p><p>And if you don't have a particularly fast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">wall charger</a> with you, you can use the A1638 as a sort of intermediary, charging it with whatever wall adapter you have while charging your smartphone with the power bank for faster speeds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="2sEy9oiCFSRgz8frqjNZSc" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1638-3" alt="The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) charging a Motorola Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2sEy9oiCFSRgz8frqjNZSc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to charging both power banks themselves, that will take significantly longer, given their capacities and the fact that they top out at 30W input. The A1638 takes a bit longer to reach a full charge, taking just under two hours to go from 0% to 100%, while the older A1259 model takes only an hour and a half.</p><p>However, this could once again be a result of reduced capacity thanks to two years of usage, but it is a significant difference. That said, I feel it hardly matters when these are used as backups; therefore, I can leave them to charge overnight and not have to worry about charging them again until they're depleted.</p><h2 id="check-your-charge-2">Check your charge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3933px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HdpUENYJuLKF3xEV88uPPb" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1638-5" alt="The Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638) displaying battery health" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HdpUENYJuLKF3xEV88uPPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3933" height="2212" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The older model came with a handy display that showed how much time you had left to charge. The newer model has this too, but the display is actually much more useful. It displays the port you're using and the amount of charge it's providing (or receiving) in real-time, allowing you to observe how it fluctuates as you charge a device for an extended period.</p><p>You can also cycle through different screens to view the battery health of the power bank, the number of charging cycles it has undergone, and its battery temperature/charging performance. Anker says its ActiveShield safety system conducts 6 million daily temperature checks "to prevent overheating and extend battery life."</p><p>Given how long I've owned the A1259 model, I believe that additional display information would be helpful in assessing its performance over the years.</p><h2 id="both-are-great-2">Both are great</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tBaBVo3QmyREUhX3KPXjJc" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-A1638-and-A1259-3" alt="The Anker Nano Power Bank A1638 and A1259" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tBaBVo3QmyREUhX3KPXjJc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're looking for a portable charger and your phone doesn't support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2 magnetic charging</a>, then you can't go wrong with the Anker Nano Power Bank (A1638). Naturally, I would recommend the newer option, primarily due to its faster charging speeds, longer built-in USB-C cable, and more useful display. If your phone supports faster charging speeds, this is one of the better options to take advantage of those speeds.</p><p>That said, the older Anker Nano Power Bank (A1259) remains a great choice, as it offers the same battery capacity, a built-in USB-C cable, and a display to monitor your charging progress. And given that some flagship phones like the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> support 25W to 30W wired charging or less, this will be a good option.</p><p>Fortunately, both chargers are regularly on sale, and you can already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGKWTQQC/">grab the newer model for 33% off</a>, while the older model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9CJKCH3">$10 cheaper right now</a>. You can also wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> to see if their prices will dip further, but if you're going to buy something during holiday sales, either of these chargers should be on your list.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What are the main differences between the Anker Nano A1259 and A1638 power banks?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The A1259 power bank has a slimmer design, while the A1638 is shorter and bulkier.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nothing's sub-brand CMF makes affordable tech products with a twist, and it recently released its first pair of over-ear headphones, the CMF Headphone Pro. It follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Nothing Headphone 1</a> launch earlier this year, but with a subdued design and a much lower price tag. The CMF Headphone Pro retails for just $99, and its latest sale knocks down the price to just $84.</p><p>I tend to consider the sweet spot in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">over-ear headphone</a> pricing to be around $300, which is what Nothing's mainline headphones cost. I lowered my expectations for Headphone Pro accordingly, but as I started testing them, I quickly realized they come with far fewer compromises than their competitors. They also align perfectly with Nothing's ethos, thanks to a thoughtful design and tactile controls, physical ports, and modularity.</p><p>Switching from pricier cans like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-one-feature-convinced-me-to-use-the-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-gen-2-instead-of-sonys-wh-1000xm6">Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2</a> and buds like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a>, I was surprised to discover how easy the CMF Headphone Pro could become my daily driver.</p><h2 id="cmf-headphone-pro-have-a-comfortable-design-with-tactile-input-2">CMF Headphone Pro have a comfortable design with tactile input</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="imJNjv46wtgqtrXZuUyFW9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-6" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imJNjv46wtgqtrXZuUyFW9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing is all about design, whether we're looking at mainline products or CMF variants. The CMF Headphone Pro sport a glossy plastic finish with a metal slider that helps adjust the headband. That glossy plastic material will look better on some colorways than others — I tested the light green model that ends up looking like teal or blue — but I think it works on Headphone Pro. It's iPod plastic, not cheap plastic.</p><p>The ear cushions and headband are both soft, and the former are interchangeable with a twist-lock system. You need to buy the replacements separately, though. There is a gap between the headphone chassis and the cushions that makes Headphone Pro feel slightly unfinished, and could cause confusion while changing styles.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LoVf4G65kYPDAvWVdH8zS9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-8" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LoVf4G65kYPDAvWVdH8zS9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In typical Nothing fashion, there are plenty of ports and buttons here — a USB-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack, two buttons, a slider, and a roller. The Energy Slider is essentially an on-headphone EQ that can adjust bass or treble intensity in real time. While the Nothing X is great for customization, it is a nice touch that you can tweak your sound signature without the app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nJ2zbQSYLorkG5tGuxX8a9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-9" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nJ2zbQSYLorkG5tGuxX8a9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most of the controls you'll use most are within the "multi-function roller," which handles volume, ANC modes, and playback controls. Would dedicated buttons for each have been better than the EQ slider? Probably, but to CMF's credit, the roller works well. It's more reliable and useful than the capacitive controls shipped on premium headphones I've tested.</p><h2 id="sound-quality-is-superb-for-the-price-i-could-use-them-daily-2">Sound quality is superb for the price — I could use them daily </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ipcwwuEgbN7WqJEtPmvBX9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-3" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipcwwuEgbN7WqJEtPmvBX9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I think of sound quality for sub-$100 headphones, a tinny profile without clear separation or booming bass comes to mind. The CMF Headphone Pro couldn't do more to dispel that image if it tried. The headphones have 40mm drivers equipped with nickel-plated diaphragms that Nothing says reduce distortion and add clarity. They're paired with a 16.5 mm copper voice coil, precision bass duct, and dual-chamber design, according to the company.</p><p>The hardware creates a sound signature that's more balanced than what I've come to expect from Nothing. The bass is certainly present, but it's not overwhelming like Headphone 1 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-3-review">Ear 3</a>. Sounds in the middle or high frequencies may not be as crisp as on pricier headphones, although they are crucially not piercing or overly bright.</p><p>The best way I could describe the Headphone Pro's sound is by reinforcing that I have all the top wireless headphones around, and I switched to CMF's $100 pair with no problem. Sure, I'd take the superior sound quality and ANC of more expensive models, but I didn't feel like I was missing out by using Headphone Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QJnKqgPiRoEkxxT3v73Cb9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-4" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QJnKqgPiRoEkxxT3v73Cb9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With LDAC support up to 990 kbps over Bluetooth, these headphones do support high-res audio. There's also a feature that builds a Personal Sound profile specific to your ears, based on the way you hear individual audio frequencies.</p><p>CMF's Headphone Pro also support "Hybrid Adaptive ANC" with three levels of active noise-canceling intensity. ANC is pretty good for the price, dampening external noise and making it imperceptible when your music is above 75% volume. Transparency mode is less helpful, as voices aren't as clear as I'd like. Still, you can get through a quick conversation with transparency mode on — but only with the music off.</p><p>Battery life is perhaps most impressive of all, hitting the 100-hour mark with ANC off. It drops to half that with ANC on, but 50 hours is decent in its own right.</p><h2 id="are-the-cmf-headphone-pro-headphones-worth-it-2">Are the CMF Headphone Pro headphones worth it?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XuLo5zoujvtiL27h9epgc9" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-2" alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in blue with interchangeable ear cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XuLo5zoujvtiL27h9epgc9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who loves superb sound quality (and is willing to pay for it), I'll never fault anyone for wanting to spend on better audio. However, the CMF Headphone Pro do cover the basics, and at $100, offer a baseline set of features that are all most people need. Decent sound quality, ANC, Spatial Audio, Hi-Res Audio, long battery life, and a headphone jack — the necessities are here.</p><p>I've tested headphones cheaper than the CMF Headphone Pro, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/its-your-last-day-to-get-bluetooth-over-ear-headphones-with-anc-and-hi-res-audio-for-usd55">OneOdio Focus A6</a>,  and many pricier ones. For those on a tight budget, Headphone Pro finds the perfect balance. There is room for improvement, but no major compromises or dealbreakers. That's hard to find in a sub-$100 pair of over-ear ANC headphones.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3c98779d-6889-49ae-b6fa-54976c941c09">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Headphone-Canceling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0FLK83CMY/" data-model-name="Headphone Pro" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nar4CX7iXBX559gBKAvKu9.jpg' alt="The CMF Headphone Pro in light green."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>CMF</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Headphone Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best on a budget</strong></em></p><p>CMF Headphone Pro will impress budget buyers with a comfortable and colorful design, solid sound quality and ANC, and long battery life.

Here's what I see.</p><p>Google aims to generate more revenue by hosting Disney's content. It won't likely carry any savings on to the subscriber, and it will all go in the vault somewhere (Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-december-2024-price-hike-reported">passes "rising content costs" to the consumer</a>).</p><p>Disney wants to generate more revenue from selling its streaming content and knows "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calls-the-us-department-of-justices-antitrust-remedies-extreme">market abuse</a>" is a hot term to throw out whenever Google is involved. That's Google's own fault for not being good enough to get away with it, I guess.</p><p>My tip of the week — guaranteed lock, bet the whole damn farm — is that neither company has any interest in making your monthly bill any cheaper.</p><p>Maybe I'm too cynical, but from what I can see, it's always that way. How much better are things for you now that Tim Sweeny and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-total-victory-doesnt-mean-as-much-as-it-wants-you-to-think">Epic had a big win</a>? Did prices go down? Are lions lying with lambs?</p><p>The same can be said about every fight, courtroom or otherwise, between companies that spend more on toilet paper every year than we'll ever earn. That's because we're simply the pawns in their game.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t6tgdBJLw25pPcYrbHJahS" name="Gemini_Generated_Image_h1dd9wh1dd9wh1dd" alt="An AI generated image of a chessboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t6tgdBJLw25pPcYrbHJahS.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The pawn is important in a chess match because there are so many of them that they become expendable assets. You can sacrifice a few if it helps you get closer to your goal.</p><p>Google and Disney love knowing that around 10 million people watch Disney content on YouTube TV, but they would be just as happy if the same amount of money were spread among just 9 million people. The money is what's important, not each subscriber.</p><p>I say things like this a lot, and people often think I'm some sort of lunatic communist who is one more magic mushroom away from screaming anarchy and burning things down. Now that sounds kind of cool, but it's not entirely true; I'm okay with knowing that this is how big business works.</p><p>People invest with the notion that they will earn from it, and the business world turns. I just want them all to admit to it; Google and Disney aren't charities or humanitarian when it comes to streaming football games or princess movies, after all.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="isjGcKtXArcr87cxJ9vkua" name="YouTube-TV-Disney-Plus-apps" alt="YouTube TV and Disney Plus apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/isjGcKtXArcr87cxJ9vkua.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's our responsibility to remember this.

Others leverage the fact that we enjoy their creations, and the time spent watching them makes us happier.</p><p>This is all true, but it overlooks the primary reason the companies exist and why they are willing to use you in their disputes. Money. Disney would never give us another Star Wars movie or send a Nat Geo team to film something amazing if it thought it wouldn't make a ton of cash. Google would never build another service or product if it didn't think it could use them to drive more revenue.</p><h2 id="we-can-fight-back-2">We can fight back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXcrZwfzk2M2rzeMv2kqtQ" name="google-tv-streamer-review-free-live-tv-2.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer Free Live TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXcrZwfzk2M2rzeMv2kqtQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Remember when I said a pawn was useful because there are so many of them?

Don't pay to stream Disney content. Wean yourself from American football or watch highlights on free YouTube channels.

One thing to note is that the patch is arriving first for users in India. Users in other regions, like the U.S. and Europe, should start seeing it next week, if not a couple more weeks into November (not unusual). For those in India, the company states the patch bears firmware vCPH2573_16.0.0.201(EX01).</p><p>The changelog is massive, as is an update of this caliber. We'll highlight some of the major talking points, but the remainder of the changelog can be viewed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1987323204254826498#:~:text=IN%3A%20CPH2573_16.0.0.201(EX01)-,Changelog,-Fast%20%26%20Smooth">via the community forum</a>.</p><p>A major change OnePlus 12 owners are in for is a much smoother OS experience. The post states that "apps now display animations that begin and end at intuitive places." Moreover, dragging and dropping UI elements to different spots on your phone should be much smoother/fluid. To make this happen, OnePlus states OxygenOS 16 introduces the Trinity Engine, which "optimizes workload and resources on the fly, maintaining smooth performance across videos, gaming, and extended camera use."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/mind-space-app-in-oxygenos-16-bridges-oneplus-ai-with-gemini-for-inspiration">Mind Space</a> is another big feature getting some new goodies in OxygenOS 16. OnePlus says users will find the Mind Assistant on its homepage, capable of getting you to your saved content quicker. The OnePlus 12's camera is getting some TLC, as it introduces motion photos through Master mode. An enhanced portrait mode facilitates more "creative control," alongside a text scanner mode.</p><p>Here are a few more notable highlights in OxygenOS 16:</p><ul><li>New visual update for Photos brings an immersive, seamless browsing experience</li><li>Photo albums are now easier to navigate with clearer categories and personalized sorting for frequently used ones</li><li>New Home screen icons showcase lifelike visuals and intricate detail through light field styling</li><li>Enjoy a cleaner, more organized Home screen with optimized grid and layout—making icons, folders, and widgets look tidier than ever</li><li>Introduces an uncluttered Home screen design by removing text beneath icons</li></ul><h2 id="right-on-schedule-2">Right on Schedule</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZvaqeXhwBnRUeDTvFUHLwE" name="oneplus-open-18.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZvaqeXhwBnRUeDTvFUHLwE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth mentioning that the OnePlus Open, the company's first foldable, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1987911901429891079">receiving the OxygenOS 16 update</a> this week in India, too.</p><p>While the OnePlus 15 already launched with OxygenOS 16 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/a-redefining-global-launch-for-the-oneplus-15-lands-in-the-us-in-november">U.S. debut confirmed in November</a>), consumers with the company's past-gen phones were patiently waiting for their turn.

These devices have already started receiving the update, which means users in more regions should start seeing it soon, as November continues.</p><p>Devices slated for December include the OnePlus 11 5G, 11R 5G, Nord 5, Nord CE5, Nord 4, and Nord 3 5G.</p><p>When OxygenOS 16 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">was first revealed</a>, it was touted as a software that truly knows the user.

You must be American, 22 years or older, and fill out a questionnaire in English for eligibility. Google will use your responses to decide whether to include you in the study.</p><p>Google also launched a second study this week called "Unusual Trend Detection," which will give you a "heads-up if your health metrics look different" from normal and "contribute to a research study."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bXS8CytaQUg3u69UdBpZBU" name="Fitbit-Labs-Unusual-Trend-Detection" alt="A photo of an Android phone showing an "Unusual Trend Detection" sign-up page in the Fitbit app for Fitbit Labs, sitting next to a Google Pixel Watch 4 atop colorful pillows." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bXS8CytaQUg3u69UdBpZBU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To find these studies, tap your profile icon in the Fitbit app, agree to "allow your data to be used for research and development," and then see which Fitbit Labs you're eligible for.</p><p>Sign up for the Fitbit Hypertension Study, and you may be sent a blood pressure cuff, which you'll be asked to wear for 24 hours in tandem with your smartwatch before sending it back. Google will give this select group $25 gift cards as an incentive; every other participant won't be compensated.</p><p>Google warns that activating the hypertension study will cause a "slight, temporary change in your watch’s battery life," but "should still last a full day on a single charge."

Google will notify you directly if it detects abnormal trends and ask you to "log possible causes and symptoms." It'll then give you "tips for rest and recovery," and once you've returned to your "typical patterns," the Fitbit app will let you know.</p><p>In theory, Google will be able to build out a database of physiological responses by detecting a specific health trend and then asking you what caused it — such as if you appear more stressed than usual and attribute it to drinking extra coffee.</p><p>Google is also in the midst of testing its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/new-fitbit-personal-health-coach-preview-arrives-tomorrow-heres-how-it-works">Fitbit Personal Health Coach</a>, which gives you "Insights" on your recent health trends and answers questions about health and fitness using your smartwatch data for context. These new Fitbit Labs studies seem to intersect with this goal, as it will allow future versions of the Fitbit Coach to describe possible causes for negative health data — such as hypertension.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster claims that Samsung has started testing some "early firmware" for the Galaxy S27 Ultra, which reportedly directly cites "Polar ID v1.0." The tipster's X post states they came across this mention within the software's early biometric security framework.</p><p>Nothing's confirmed (as there's nothing to see specifically); however, the tipster's discovery leveraged some early details, such as this potentially becoming "full-face authentication."</p><p>The company's software suggests that this new software could reduce unlock latency severely, while also improving its "spoof-resistance." It also appears that Samsung is working on a new "ISOCELL Vizion" camera sensor to make this possible on its future Galaxy phone, if/when this happens.</p><h2 id="not-even-2026-and-we-re-looking-at-2027-2">Not even 2026 and we're looking at 2027</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: Early test firmware for the Galaxy S27 Ultra references something called “Polar ID v1.0” under the biometric security framework.

Rumors claim the S26 Ultra could feature a 6.89-inch M14 OLED display that might hide its contents for added privacy. A dive into One UI 8.5. suggests Samsung's working on a privacy feature that could limit how much of your display is visible to prying eyes around you (notably from the side).</p><p>There are some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protectors">third-party privacy screen protectors</a> that do this for the Galaxy, but Samsung seems interested in making it a part of the device, instead.</p><p>Other S26 Ultra-related rumors claim Samsung could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-ultra-s-pen-might-ditch-the-boxy-look-for-softer-curves">make changes to its S Pen</a> by making it softer, not boxy.

Ultra-fast charging phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> charge up to 100W with the brick included in the box, while most phones from Google and Samsung don't realistically charge faster than 45W for more than a few minutes, even with a special charger.</p><p>That's led to many people believing that Apple, Google, and Samsung have kept charging slower to prolong battery health over time. One YouTuber was tired of the baseless debate and decided to put 40 phones to a series of three tests over a 2-year time span, and he came away with one conclusion: "charge however you like."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kLS5Cg_yNdM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Check out the video for specific stats, but the gist is this: fast charging does not negatively affect battery life in any measurable way. The automated testbed he created charged phones up then drained them again for over 500 cycles. The main test took over 6 months to get all phones to this 500 cycle mark, while the other two tests were mostly inconclusive due to testing issues.</p><p>HTX found that Android phones using 120W charging only showed an average of 0.3% difference in battery health compared to the 18W charging by the end of this 500 cycle test. In other words, it's far more convenient to fast charge your phone than to worry about a fraction of a percentage of battery health loss over time.</p><p>A second series of tests aimed to prove whether or not keeping your phone between 30-80% could improve battery health over time. The results showed a 2.5% difference in battery health between phones that were regularly charged to 100% and drained to 0% battery compared with phones kept in the 30-80% range, giving the latter the edge.</p><p>Of course, purposefully limiting your phone's battery capacity <em>to 50%</em> doesn't seem to make much sense if you're only saving 2.5% battery health over the course of 2 years. Once again, HTX's statement rings true: just use the phone as you'd like. It doesn't really make a difference.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This has left several YouTube TV users in limbo, without access to ESPN, ABC, and other Disney channels.</p><p>The ongoing issue resulted in subscribers missing both a football game and the election day coverage that occurred earlier this week.

With a goal for hands-free navigation, Gemini will allow you to ask for things while on the go, like "Find a budget-friendly restaurant with vegan options along my route," or follow up with questions like, "What's the parking like there?"</p><p>Additionally, users will also be able to report traffic disruptions more naturally, simply saying things like, "I see an accident," or "Watch out for that slowdown," instead of tapping on the screen whilst driving.</p><p>The most exciting update is that Google Lens is directly built in with Gemini at its core. Users arriving at a restaurant can open Lens and ask about the establishment. They will be able to voice their query or type it, and let Gemini explain "what's so popular" about the place they're at.</p><h2 id="qualcomm-s-ai-powered-double-digit-q4-earnings-2">Qualcomm's AI powered double digit Q4 earnings</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GydEHdpR5yRDRoLdAfAouQ" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-Agentic-AI-2.JPG" alt="Agentic AI example" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GydEHdpR5yRDRoLdAfAouQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-fy-q4-2025-earnings"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Qualcomm ended its year reporting a Q4 revenue of $11.3 billion, with a 10% year-over-year increase.

In the video, the presenter goes over the various visible phone specs.</p><p>Regarding the display, the tri-fold could have a 6.5-inch display, similar to a regular smartphone; however, when unfolded, it will feature a 10-inch display. The video also reveals that the display's bezels appear thick, which could limit usable screen space.</p><p>You can also see that the camera placement of the trifold is similar to that of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, as the lenses are placed vertically on an elevated camera bump with the flash off to the side.

The search giant has teamed up with Reliance Intelligence, and is just giving away an 18-month subscription of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro</a> plan to all Jio customers. Jio is India's second-largest carrier, and it has over 500 million subscribers as of writing; and yes, all eligible customers get the AI Pro plan without having to pay anything.</p><p>Obviously, as deals go, this is quite good. All you need to do is have a Jio connection to claim the offer. The deal was initially limited to 18 - 25 year-old users, and it is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/partnering-with-reliance-to-bring-the-best-of-google-ai-to-more-people-across-india/">rolling out to all Jio customers</a> in India. Google did a similar deal in the past where it gave away its AI services to college students, and what's notable this time is that it isn't just targeted at students.</p><p>The Google AI Pro plan includes 2TB of storage as standard, and comes with full access to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model. You also get the Veo 3.1 AI video generator utility, Nano Banana AI image-editing tool, and the AI-based NotebookLLM research tool. Now, if you're not a Jio user, the best way to get in on the action is to buy a new SIM — this is what I just did.</p><p>When it comes to eligibility, you'll just need to have a valid Jio SIM card, and an active 5G plan that costs at least ₹349 ($4) a month or more — that's all. If you're an eligible Jio user, you can just head on over to the MyJio app and claim the offer, and get 18 months of Google AI Pro. The plan costs ₹1,950 ($22) a month in the country, so you're getting ₹35,100 ($396) worth of storage and AI credits without paying anything.</p><p>Google isn't the only one giving away AI tools in India; the country's largest carrier Airtel is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.airtel.in/perplexity-pro/">giving away one year of Perplexity Pro</a> to all customers. Regardless of what carrier you use in India, there's a good chance of getting the latest AI models without shelling out any cash. And while I'm ambivalent towards AI in general, I'll admit that Google's AI Pro plan has quite the feature-set, and I've been using Gemini regularly over the course of the last year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung is expected to unveil its newest flagship lineup during an Unpacked announcement event in Q1 2026, and if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026">latest leaks and rumors</a> are correct, we'll finally get our hands on the phones sometime in March. That's significantly later than Samsung's usual release timeline, but if it means that the S26 will get more time in the oven, then I'm all for it.</p><p>While we wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> to drop, many folks are wondering what the release will mean for the Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup. Will the best-selling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> get a permanent price drop or will they simply disappear from shelves? Should you wait for the Galaxy S26 lineup or buy a S25 during this month's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Black Friday sales</a>? Let's break it all down.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>According to the latest rumors, the next Galaxy Unpacked event will be held on February 25th in San Francisco, California. This means that, since new Samsung phones usually hit store shelves about two weeks after their unveiling, we can expect that the Galaxy S26 series will finally be available for purchase around March 12th or 13th.</p><p>Along with the Galaxy S26 Plus and S26 Ultra, the base model Galaxy S26 (which might be renamed the Galaxy S26 Pro), is expected to come equipped with a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, some meaningful camera upgrades, and all of the latest AI software tricks.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-lockscreen-widgets-neon" alt="A Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with a widget-covered lockscreen on a rainy neon-soaked street" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't know a lot about the flagship phones yet, so comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-vs-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S26 vs Galaxy S25</a> is a bit tricky, but suffice to say that the S26 devices are expected to be slimmer, faster, and more feature-packed than their predecessors. They're also expected to be a bit more expensive, starting around $899 for the base model and going up to around $1,400 for the S26 Ultra.</p><p>Will the improvements justify the price hike? It's tough to say, but it wouldn't be unreasonable for someone to buy the tried-and-tested Samsung Galaxy S25 instead of the newer model, especially if you can get a good price. Speaking of which..</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Samsung Galaxy S25 get cheaper?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-6" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>So will the Samsung Galaxy S25 get a price drop when the S26 arrives?</strong> Not exactly.</p><p>Although it does happen on occasion, it's pretty unusual for flagship phones to get a permanent price decrease when they reach last-gen status. It's <em>more</em> likely that they'll get discounted once their successors are released, but it's just as possible that the S25 will simply run out of stock once the S26 arrives. Think about it this way: how often do you see a discounted Galaxy S24 that isn't refurbished? Sure, it happens (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced/dp/B0D7HWJDQM"><strong>Google Pixel 9 is 38% off</strong></a> today, for instance), but it's not as common as you might think.</p><p>On the bright side, price tracking data indicates that devices tend to get the cheapest <em>right before</em> the next generation arrives. And with Black Friday sales just around the corner, you can fully expect the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra to receive some record-smashing discounts in the coming weeks. For a little context, the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DP3FNTRP"><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 dropped to $699.99</strong></a> during last month's October Prime Day sale event.

A key Google Messages feature allows users to pin conversations to the top of their inbox for easy access. This can come in handy if you have a contact you message often, or are saving a chat to respond to later. However, the Google Messages app previously only let users pin 10 chats at a time.</p><p>Now, Google Messages will let Android users pin up to 20 conversations at once. The change was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-20-pinned-conversations-3613658/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> while testing a beta version of the Google Messages app. Android Central confirmed the expanded pin limit is available in version <strong>messages.android_20251103_00_RC00</strong> of the Google Messages beta, and it appears to have made its way to the public version of the app as well.</p><p>It's unlikely many users were running into the ten-chat limit for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> pins very often. Depending on your device and its screen size, Google Messages can fit anywhere between eight and ten conversations on the inbox view at a time. With the expanded 20-pin limit, users will need to scroll through two pages of pinned chats to get to their newest conversations — assuming they max out the number of pins.</p><p>Google Messages started out only supporting three pinned conversations at a time. Then, it subsequently expanded the limit to five and ten pinned chats. After doubling the limit twice, Google Messages can now handle 20 pinned conversations.</p><h2 id="how-to-pin-chats-in-google-messages-2">How to pin chats in Google Messages</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AhnPQzMsnENqgC4TinR4Wi" name="Google-Messages-Pinned-Conversations" alt="The pinned conversation limit showing in Google Messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhnPQzMsnENqgC4TinR4Wi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pinning conversations in Google Messages is simple.

Over the past year, it has evolved from being an overly complicated emulator for the most dedicated of enthusiasts to offering significantly more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uRe42W4eMJYigHJzaUzheY" name="hollow-knight-silksong-winlator-pixel-10-pro-fold" alt="Hollow Knight: Silksong via Winlator on Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uRe42W4eMJYigHJzaUzheY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One such example, and arguably one of the most popular options currently in the community, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gamehub.xiaoji.com/">GameSir GameHub</a>. I've written about it a few times, but this takes Winlator, puts it in a user-friendly wrapper, and lets you download compatible games right from your Steam library. Recently, I was able to go from installing GameHub to running Hollow Knight: Silksong within 15-20 minutes, without fiddling with any settings besides signing into my Steam account.</p><p>Some of that speed can also be attributed to GameHub's ability to identify the device you're using and the game you're trying to play, and automatically apply settings known to work. Whereas, if you were to fire up Winlator, you'll probably be spending quite a bit of time trying to find the right settings, only for the game to not load or work properly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="psjqgjqyuGdy28cK8JHF8K" name="rocknix-odin-2-portal-ayaneo-pocket-evo-2" alt="ROCKNIX booting on the AYN Odin 2 Portal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psjqgjqyuGdy28cK8JHF8K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Plus, we already know that the Snapdragon 8 Elite is more than capable of emulating other consoles, including Switch games. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-cant-believe-it-theres-actually-a-switch-emulator-on-the-play-store">Eden</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://citron-emu.org/">Citron</a> have both recently released major updates to their respective emulators, introducing better performance and compatibility.

We just have to hope that development continues to flourish, uninterrupted.</p><p>With all of that in mind, how did I manage to perform the mental gymnastics of comparing these two Android-based handhelds to the Steam Deck, an x86 handheld? It's actually quite simple. Both AYANEO and AYN are releasing handhelds that look to offer the same price-to-performance ratio that the Steam Deck still does to this day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v8nToka5jbpAdGZAY2zY5C" name="retroid-pocket-g2-colors" alt="Retroid Pocket G2 Color Options render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8nToka5jbpAdGZAY2zY5C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You could even toss the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/retroid-just-announced-the-pocket-6-but-the-community-wanted-something-different-and-thats-exactly-what-it-got">Retroid Pocket G2</a> into the mix, with its Snapdragon G2 Gen 2, offering excellent emulation and gaming performance for around $200. Ultimately, the point is that the Steam Deck revolutionized the x86 handheld space by lowering the price barrier, and now AYANEO, AYN, and Retroid are doing the same.</p><p>You can always fall back on using the phone or tablet you already own to play games on the go.

Now, while this number seems high, the post notes that Drive Research is a market research firm that polled 1,100 U.S. consumers with a YouTube TV subscription.</p><p>This 82% are "likely" to cancel; however, 24% of those surveyed claim that they have "already cancelled" or are at least "planning to" at some point.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, as noted in the firm's research, people have subscribed to YouTube TV to obtain the content they want to see (channels from Disney). Over half state they did so to view sports on ESPN, like the NFL. Nearly half claim that they've purchased a YouTube TV subscription because "they value the ability to share the service with household members or use multiple streams," per Variety.</p><p>YouTube TV reportedly chimed in, as Variety notes, a spokesperson offered comment about Drive Research's survey. YouTube TV throws shade, stating, "We’re not familiar with this firm and can’t speak to their credibility or methodology." The spokesperson adds that while it doesn't love "subscriber churn," what's been happening recently has been "manageable" and "does not align with the findings of this survey."</p><p>Advancing the narrative, roughly 30% of Drive Research's findings state that people are already looking to directly subscribe to ESPN Unlimited and Hulu Plus Live TV just to get what they're missing.</p><h2 id="it-s-been-a-rough-going-and-the-viewer-is-tired-2">It's been a rough going, and the viewer is tired</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i6QjyoxxpBNsRJAwNjHMyU" name="youtube-tv-169.jpg" alt="YouTube TV home page with TV screen in background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i6QjyoxxpBNsRJAwNjHMyU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is probably a wealth of emotions and takes that can arise from a situation like this, especially from the consumers, but the fact of the matter is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-disney-stalemate-continues-as-neither-side-agrees-to-end-the-blackout">we're stuck in a deadlock</a>.

So when you see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/are-garmin-watches-like-fenix-8-pro-getting-too-expensive">how expensive new Garmin watches</a> are getting, a years-old Garmin at a steep discount will look mighty tempting. Since Garmin likes to clear out old stock during Black Friday, it's worth deciding now whether a last-gen Garmin watch is right for you, or if newer is better.</p><p>I've covered Garmin watch deals for years, and I always have to weigh whether I should recommend deals on models like the Forerunner 55 or 745 that are years out of date and have noticeable flaws, but let you buy into the Garmin ecosystem for $150 instead of $500.</p><p>Then you have Garmin's old flagships. Right now, you can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-fenix-7x-sapphire-solar-gps-smartwatch-51-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-carbon-gray-dlc-titanium-2022/JXF9YFWZXX"><strong>Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar for $599 ($300 off)</strong> </a>or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Multisport-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability/dp/B0BYFCW2GR"><strong>7X Pro Sapphire Solar for $659 ($340 off</strong></a>).

But if you're planning to make your watch last for years, can you live without the quality-of-life improvements Garmin has introduced recently?</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e5c584f5-a0c5-4f47-ac51-1b1adda120a2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features." data-dimension48="With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features." data-dimension25="$599.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-fenix-7x-sapphire-solar-gps-smartwatch-51-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-carbon-gray-dlc-titanium-2022/JXF9YFWZXX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:817px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.55%;"><img id="amkHwd84SVifpoLX8GNPsg" name="garmin-fenix-7x-solar-watch-render-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/amkHwd84SVifpoLX8GNPsg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="817" height="846" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-fenix-7x-sapphire-solar-gps-smartwatch-51-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-carbon-gray-dlc-titanium-2022/JXF9YFWZXX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e5c584f5-a0c5-4f47-ac51-1b1adda120a2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features." data-dimension48="With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features." data-dimension25="$599.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Garmin's most recent generation has focused on what I'd call "mainstream" upgrades. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> added an AMOLED display, ECG and skin temperature data, and a mic & speaker for calls and commands. Those same features trickled down to cheaper Garmin models, along with the flashlight. Eventually, I'd bet that the Fenix 8 Pro's LTE-M and satellite tools will come to more watches, too.</p><p>The question becomes, do you <em>need</em> these? I don't use many of these new features especially often, but I strongly prefer AMOLED to MIP and would have trouble going back. For anyone tempted by smartwatches, you might prefer a much cheaper Vivoactive or Venu to a bulky Fenix 7X that hasn't modernized.</p><p>For people who use their old Garmin watch for basic workout tracking and glancing at notifications, though, splurging on a last-gen Fenix deal is smarter, because you're only paying for the fitness perks you'll care about, not the bells and whistles.</p><h2 id="don-t-let-software-fomo-make-you-pay-extra-2">Don't let software FOMO make you pay extra</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jUNVoitpCtXTVbsvFDP6oX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-voice-assistant" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 showing "Listening" for the new voice assistant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUNVoitpCtXTVbsvFDP6oX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We also have to discuss Garmin's software gatekeeping. Even if Garmin watch hardware has a reputation for lasting years, they do so as closed-circuit artifacts of their time. At a certain point, Garmin locks off the OS and refuses to add any new features that might disrupt the delicate equilibrium.</p><p>Unfortunately, that tends to happen within 1–2 years, even for Garmin's Fenix flagships. There was plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1ihbdr6/garmin_abandoned_fenix_7_pro_after_15_years/">controversy</a> when Garmin stopped giving the Fenix 7 series new features after the Fenix 8 launch; now, anyone buying the Fenix 7X today won't get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running economy</a>, evening reports, Strength or Triathlon Coaching, a rucking mode, or other new features that've impressed me over the last year.</p><p>But that can't be helped! Garmin's strategy is to weaponize FOMO so that you feel tempted to buy the newest model. Then you feel entitled to cutting-edge features, and when they run out, you upgrade again. I guarantee Fenix 8 owners will be complaining about this in 2026, after the Fenix 9 launches.</p><p>Maybe buying an older model that's already cut off from feature updates is a good way to make sure you don't pay attention to shiny new Garmin toys, and remain happy with what you have for longer.</p><h2 id="buying-last-gen-is-fine-focus-more-on-what-you-need-2">Buying last-gen is fine; focus more on what you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WmVVuJaLkpeaxLmnW386XD" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review" alt="The Garmin Venu 4 on a marble surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WmVVuJaLkpeaxLmnW386XD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> are more expensive than ever. Mid-range models like the $550 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-fitness-heart-rate-steps">Venu 4</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> are impressive, but why buy either of them when you can get an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-epix-pro-gen-2-sapphire-edition-47mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-carbon-gray-dlc-titanium-with-black-band-2024/JXF9YF4LFS"><strong>Epix Pro (Gen 2) for $499 ($250 off)</strong></a>? It's a question of whether last year's best features (like offline maps) or 2025's newest upgrades (like doubled AMOLED brightness) are more important to you.</p><p>It's an entirely different discussion if you're looking at lower-end Garmin watches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Venu Sq 2</a> is frequently one of the cheapest models available during deal events, but it's quite limited in several ways. I'd much rather spend slightly more on a <em>new</em> cheap Garmin like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a> (currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-vivoactive-6-gps-smartwatch-42-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-slate-with-black-band-2025/JXF9YF5F9G/sku/10871976">$50 off on Best Buy</a>) than buy a model that will feel obsolete out of the box.</p><p>Otherwise, if you're really tempted by some of the best new Garmin watches, you'll have to be patient. Based on Garmin's typical deals timeline, we probably won't see a Fenix 8 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a> for $300 off until 2027 or 2028.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, ahead of the next major Pixel update, Google has released new Theme Packs on the Play Store.</p><p>Late last month, a tipster on Telegram reported that Google is working on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-leak-says-some-wicked-theme-packs-vip-alerts-pixels-next-month">major November Pixel Drop update</a> that will bring many new features to Pixel smartphones. Features such as "Pixel VIPs," which allow special alerts for your closest contacts, as well as improvements to the Pixel Studio app, are on the way. However, the biggest update is system theming support coming to Pixel devices.</p><p>Many Android devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-17-series-pro-pro-max-launch">Xiaomi 17</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-tested-the-oppo-find-x9-pros-camera-i-cant-believe-how-good-it-is">Oppo's Find X9</a> series, and OnePlus phones have enjoyed theming for a long time. However, Google has stuck to its own Material 3 Expressive design, which draws colors from the phone's wallpaper and applies them across the system. It looks like we're now in for a major revamp as a new Theme Packs app has been spotted on the Play Store (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/05/pixel-theme-packs/">9to5Google</a>).</p><h2 id="google-s-new-theme-packs-hint-at-big-pixel-changes-2">Google's new Theme Packs hint at big Pixel changes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1884px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.92%;"><img id="H9ioDLGsjP9XKH28mWVbnQ" name="pixel-theme-app-screenshots" alt="Screenshots from Theme Packs app's Play Store listing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H9ioDLGsjP9XKH28mWVbnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1884" height="1110" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Play Store)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.pixel.customizationbundle">Play Store listing</a>, these theme packs will allow users to "Personalize your Pixel in one tap." "Instantly unlock a complete refresh that updates your wallpaper, icons, sounds, GIFs, and more with seasonal theme packs," reads the app's description.</p><p>And it's not just the listing, we also have our first look at the first Pixel theme, which is based on the Wicked: For Good! movie. There are three options: For Good, Glinda, and Elphaba. As expected, applying a theme adjusts your Pixel's wallpaper, system colors, sounds, and more throughout.</p><p>The app shows a preview of how your phone will look once applied, with a download button in the top-right corner.

The company first previewed the switch around the time of Google I/O, saying that Gemini would arrive on Android Auto  "in the coming months" and "this fall." Now, there are signs that Gemini is finally arriving for your car, and it's rolling out for some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto">Android Auto</a> users as of this week.</p><p>Multiple Android Auto users are seeing Gemini replace Google Assistant in their cars starting late Wednesday, Nov. 5, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1opoieb/got_gemini_tonight/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> (via 9to5Google). It's a server-side update that was spotted on Android Auto versions 15.6 and 15.7, per users in the Reddit thread. Those two Android Auto builds are currently in beta, and it isn't apparent yet whether the server-side rollout is only for beta testers, or if it'll soon expand to public builds.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1opoieb/got_gemini_tonight">Got Gemini tonight</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto">r/AndroidAuto</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Gemini on Android Auto completely replaces <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistan</a>t, but it keeps support for the "Hey Google" wake word. Key upgrades that come with Gemini for Android Auto include better natural-language understanding and Gemini Live support. With the latter, users can have a fluid conversation in real-time with Gemini Live while driving. The Gemini interface lives either at the bottom or side of the Android Auto view, depending on the car's screen size and aspect ratio.</p><p>Android Auto users also get Gemini's expanded integration with Google apps and services, like Home for smart home management, Keep for quick notes, Maps for directions, and more. Just this week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps/google-maps-gets-a-gemini-boost-to-help-you-navigate-the-roads-like-a-pro">Google brought Gemini to Google Maps</a> to give smarter directions based on AI and Google Lens analysis.</p><p>Gemini will be able to translate text messages in Android Auto in over 40 languages, and you can edit a translated message's content without having to completely start the command over.</p><h2 id="what-it-s-like-to-use-android-auto-and-gemini-together-2">What it's like to use Android Auto and Gemini together</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9" name="Android-Auto-Gemini-Live" alt="Gemini Live and Google Maps on Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Central <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/i-tried-a-google-built-in-car-and-its-a-sneak-peek-at-gemini-on-android-auto">tested Gemini in Android Auto at Google I/O 2025</a> earlier this year. Compared to Google Assistant, Gemini handles complicated requests better and is great at deciphering multiple follow-ups. For example, Gemini users can start a navigation session with Android Auto while also asking what time a restaurant closes and how far it is from the nearest gas station — all with their voice.</p><p>Like other Gemini versions, Gemini for Android Auto understands and remembers things with personal context, like knowing to always text a particular context in Spanish.</p><p>Android Auto is supported by 250 million cars, and they'll soon get an AI boost with Gemini. The AI-powered digital assistant is already rolling out now for some Android Auto users, with wider availability expected to follow.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The highlights include AI-generated flashcards and quizzes that can be customized to a user's liking.

Aside from customizing the topic, difficulty, or size of the flashcards or quiz, these can be guided in a particular direction with a text prompt. After a flashcard set or quiz is generated in the Studio tab of the NotebookLM app, a full-screen UI appears, similar to other study apps like Quizlet.</p><h2 id="everything-you-can-do-with-study-tools-in-notebooklm-2">Everything you can do with study tools in NotebookLM</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="npu4ARaczaXZ3YqUsGah6L" name="Notebook-LM-Quiz" alt="Flashcard and quiz support in the NotebookLM." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npu4ARaczaXZ3YqUsGah6L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's everything you can do with flashcards and quizzes in the NotebookLM app for iOS and Android, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-app-quizzes-flashcards/" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p><ul><li>Memorize key terms, important dates and core concepts from your sources with flashcards.</li><li>Test your comprehension and challenge yourself with quizzes.</li><li>Customize the topic, set the difficulty and choose the number of cards or questions.</li><li>Temporarily select and unselect sources while chatting or creating outputs in the Studio tab, so the response is only based on the sources you care about right now.</li></ul><p>Flashcards and quizzes leverage NotebookLM's core research capabilities.

While there have been new additions to this segment, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nuu-b40-5g-hands-on">Nuu B40 5G</a>, which ships with a secondary OLED display on the back that not even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> offer, Samsung and Motorola continue to dominate this space.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and the holiday season approaching, more people are looking to upgrade their phones this fall, and just in time, Motorola has introduced the new Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026. Both smartphones continue to follow budget-friendly traits established previously, while incorporating new features to meet the expectations of users in 2025.</p><p>If you've been wondering about the key differences between these two Moto G smartphones and which one suits you better, let's see how they compare.</p><h2 id="moto-g-2026-vs-moto-g-play-2026-price-color-and-availability-2">Moto G 2026 vs. Moto G Play 2026: Price, color, and availability</h2><p>Motorola unveiled the new Moto G smartphones on November 4, 2025. Similar to the previous Moto G series phones, these models target the budget segment for users seeking the best value for their money.</p><p>The Moto G 2026 is the pricier of the two, starting at $200 in the U.S. It comes with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. There's no higher storage option, but it's available in two beautiful Pantone colors: Slipstream and Cattleya Orchid. The phone isn't available for purchase right away, with sales in North America beginning on December 11, 2025.</p><p>The Moto G Play 2026, on the other hand, is the more affordable of the two and costs just $170. It will be available sooner, starting November 13, 2025, through Motorola's online store, other online retailers, and carrier outlets. The Moto G Play 2026 offers 64GB of onboard storage and, unlike its pricier sibling, comes in only one color: Pantone Tapestry.</p><h2 id="moto-g-2026-vs-moto-g-play-2026-design-and-display-2">Moto G 2026 vs. Moto G Play 2026: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKwAjrcuiW4RbYgzhz3SVU" name="Moto-G-2026-colors" alt="Moto G 2026 colors next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKwAjrcuiW4RbYgzhz3SVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola has settled into a consistent design language for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">budget phones</a>, and the new Moto G models are no exception. Both the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 feature a similar design, characterized by a plain back, a slightly raised camera module that blends seamlessly into the rear panel, and the Motorola 'M' dimple in the center.</p><p>Design-wise, both smartphones appear nearly identical and share the same materials, including an eco-leather back and a plastic frame. They even share the same dimensions of 167.15 x 76.40 x 8.44 mm and weight of 202g. Both phones also have the same button placement with volume rocks and a power button on the right side of the phones, and a USB-C port and a headphone jack at the bottom.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FKxFRxnntbK9FvdqRYFANU" name="Moto-G-2026-display" alt="Moto G 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FKxFRxnntbK9FvdqRYFANU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8000" height="4500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola display showing clouds in the sky)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the camera module may appear to house a triple-camera setup with a flash, the actual camera hardware differs between the two devices, but more on that later.</p><p>Overall, there are a few design differences, except for color options. The Moto G 2026 comes in a vibrant purple hue and a light bluish tone, while the Moto G Play 2026 is available only in a muted blue variant.</p><p>Although the design may seem a little plain and uninspiring, Motorola has prioritized practicality by equipping both phones with an IP52 dust and water resistance rating. While it's no match for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP68 rating</a> found on modern flagships, it's still reassuring to know your phone can handle light rain and splashes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tsEuZLHJKzs7inoNiZ4f5D" name="Moto-G-Play-lifestyle-2-pantone-tapestry" alt="A man using a Moto G Play 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tsEuZLHJKzs7inoNiZ4f5D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4599" height="2587" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moving to the front, both phones are similar here, too. Both Moto G models feature a 6.7-inch LCD display with HD+ resolution and up to a 120Hz refresh rate. The screens reach up to 1,000 nits of peak brightness, which, while not extreme, should ensure good outdoor visibility.</p><p>For protection, Motorola has used Gorilla Glass 3, which, although not as tough as the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 used in many modern high-end phones, is reasonable for the price.</p><h2 id="moto-g-2026-vs-moto-g-play-2026-hardware-and-specs-2">Moto G 2026 vs. Moto G Play 2026: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3106px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SxLdwrSRptfHVF8ueUEZfT" name="Moto-G-2026-lifestyle-1-Pantone-Cattleya-Orchid" alt="Moto G 2026 on a table next to a cup of coffee" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SxLdwrSRptfHVF8ueUEZfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3106" height="1747" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moto G smartphones have never been known for top-tier processors, and the same applies here. Both the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 ship with the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset. For those unaware, the Dimensity 6300 is an octa-core processor featuring two Cortex-A76 cores clocked at 2.4 GHz and six Cortex-A55 cores at 2 GHz. The chipset is manufactured by TSMC using a 6nm process and is approximately a year old at this point. Graphics are handled by the Mali-G57 MP2 GPU.</p><p>It's not a high-end chipset that will blow you away, but it should handle daily tasks just fine. What's good, however, is that it brings 5G support to the Moto G Play series for the first time.</p><p>Motorola has used this chipset before in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>, and if things remain similar on the software side, performance should not "be as big of an issue as one might think," in the words of our own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/derrek-lee">Derrek Lee</a>.</p><p>Speaking of software, both the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16" target="_blank">Android 16</a> pre-installed.

The main difference lies in storage: the extra $30 for the Moto G 2026 gets you 128GB of internal storage, while the Moto G Play comes with just 64GB. Both phones support microSD expansion up to 1TB, which should be plenty for most of your apps, photos, games, and videos.</p><p>When it comes to battery life and charging, both models feature a 5,200mAh cell, with Motorola claiming up to two days on a single charge.</p><p>The difference is in charging speed: the Moto G 2026 supports 30W USB-C fast charging, while the Moto G Play caps at 18W. This could result in noticeable differences in real-world use, but we'll need more testing to confirm.

Kicking off the party is OnePlus with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/a-redefining-global-launch-for-the-oneplus-15-lands-in-the-us-in-november">global launch</a> of the OnePlus 15, expected to take place on November 13. Besides sporting the new Qualcomm chip, this new flagship also features a new design for the series, a much larger battery, and the latest software with more AI improvements. This large-screened phone then competes nicely with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, an equally premium flagship.</p><p>In the battle for being the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android smartphone</a>, the Galaxy S25 Ultra already has an edge with the S Pen, more years of OS upgrades, and a brighter display. It's more expensive, though, which is where the OnePlus 15 comes in with equally compelling features but at a lower price. The official global specs of the 15 shouldn't be too different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-new-oneplus-15-launches-in-china">recently launched China variant</a>, so let's see what a OnePlus 15 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra actually looks like when we break it down.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VWENz9iw98f9eq9JZVi2SF" name="OnePlus-15-official-cameras" alt="The OnePlus 15 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWENz9iw98f9eq9JZVi2SF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2016" height="1134" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first thing you'll notice about the OnePlus 15 is that the camera bump is no longer circular, but rather a square. Its predecessor's design was quite unique, but the 15 resembles the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a> or Oppo's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>. Neither of these phones is officially sold in the North American market, though, which makes the design of the OnePlus 15 stand out.</p><p>For a phone with a massive battery, OnePlus has managed to keep the thickness and weight comparable to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. As before, there's also an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a> for extreme waterproofing.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 also features a relatively large display of 6.78 inches. It features an LTPO AMOLED panel with a staggering 165Hz refresh rate and a pixel-dense screen. The resolution is still a bit lower than what Samsung offers with the S25 Ultra, though this shouldn't really matter with regular use. The peak brightness is also lower, reaching a maximum of 1,800 nits. From what we've seen so far, the phone appears to have extremely thin bezels around the display, which enhances immersion when viewing content.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cs9wTvyCUbuTQbPpCiueCW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-back-01" alt="The back of the silver Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cs9wTvyCUbuTQbPpCiueCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is physically larger than the OnePlus 15, both in thickness and weight. The more angular edges of the phone also make it more cumbersome to handle, especially for those with smaller hands. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-waterproof">IP rating is only IP68</a>, which isn't as comprehensive as the OnePlus 15 IP rating. You do get the S Pen with it, though, which is handy for jotting down notes or signing documents.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a larger 6.9-inch display compared to the OnePlus 15, along with higher brightness of up to 2,600 nits and a denser resolution. One unique feature that's not present on most flagship phones is an anti-reflective coating over the display, which helps reduce glare and reflections significantly.</p><p>In terms of ergonomics and display quality, the OnePlus 15 should have an edge over the S25 Ultra.

The company is introducing a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-latest-tech-promises-to-enhance-the-android-gaming-experience">Hyper Rendering technology</a>, which is said to improve per-frame rendering efficiency by 80%. This, along with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-latest-tech-promises-to-enhance-the-android-gaming-experience">other on-chip optimizations</a>, positions the 15 as one of the best smartphones for gaming.</p><p>The China variant offers 12GB and 16GB RAM options, as well as storage tiers that range up to 1TB. This could change with the global variant, so we'll have to wait and see what the rest of the world gets.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 boasts a massive battery of 7,300mAh, which significantly outperforms the 5,000mAh capacity of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Charging speeds of the China variant are as follows: 120W wired and 50W wireless. The charging speeds could also differ slightly in the global variant, so we'll know what we're getting soon enough.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 will launch in three colors called Infinite Black, Ultra Violet, and Sand Storm. There's no word on the pricing yet till it officially launches on November 13, but expect to start at around $900, like its predecessor.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 15</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16, (OxygenOS 16)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Infinite Black, Sand Storm, Ultra Violet</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Silver Blue, Titanium Black, Titanium White Silver, Titanium Gray, Titanium Jade Green, Titanium Jet Black, Titanium Pink Gold</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.78 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.9 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,772 x 1,272</p></td><td  ><p>3,120 x 1,440 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>LTPO</p></td><td  ><p>LTPO OLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz (up to 165Hz for gaming)</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB, 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB (not expandable)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB (not expandable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto, 32MP front</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main,<br>50MP ultrawide,<br>10MP telephoto (3x),<br>50MP telephoto (5x),<br>12MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,300mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>161.42 x 76.67 x 8.2 mm (8mm for Sand Storm)</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>211-215 grams</p></td><td  ><p>218 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is not even a year old, which means it still has plenty of life left in it. In fact, Samsung plans on supporting it with OS upgrades and security patches for the next seven years. The custom Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in the Ultra is also plenty powerful for gaming and multitasking. In benchmarks and certain AI tasks, the new Gen 5 in the OnePlus 15 may surpass it, but most users should not notice a significant difference in day-to-day usage.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra can be equipped with up to 1TB of storage and features 12GB of RAM across its variants. The 5,000mAh battery might not be as large as the 15's, but it's nothing to scoff at either. In our testing, we were quite happy with the multi-day battery life it offered. Charging speeds are not the quickest either, but it gets the job done. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">S25 Ultra is Qi2-ready</a>, which means it can do magnetic wireless charging with the help of the right case.</p><p>The S25 Ultra comes in more colors, including some exclusive shades if you buy it via Samsung's website. It still costs over $1,000, though, even with the small price reduction since its debut in January 2025.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cameras-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.82%;"><img id="Uk6LMmYu2uwJdwmBXcWHK8" name="oneplus-15-camera-module-look" alt="First look at the OnePlus 15's back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uk6LMmYu2uwJdwmBXcWHK8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2655" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the years, OnePlus' number series has typically had good primary cameras, but their selfie and secondary cameras have either hit or missed the mark, depending on the generation.

With every SoC iteration, we get better performance and power efficiency, which means it's a little less stress on the battery when doing intensive workloads like gaming or AI processing. Considering how on-device AI workloads on phones are only getting stronger with every passing year, it's nice to know you have the hardware that's capable of doing such tasks efficiently.</p><p>Long-term software support is something where OnePlus still has a lot of catching up to do, and if you plan to hold on to your purchase for more than four years, you would be better off with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Seven years of updates is no joke, and that S Pen can be quite handy at times.</p><p>If you've made up your mind about spending more than $1,000, then I'd also suggest waiting till January 2026 to see what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> offers.

Google's answer to that question is simple: agentic AI. Google has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">touting the future of agentic AI</a> for a while now, starting with an appearance at Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event in January 2025 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">continuing at Google I/O</a> in May 2025. There are consumer-facing projects that leverage agentic help, like Agent Mode, and more developer and enterprise tools — like the Gemini API.</p><p>In this case, businesses, schools, and developers can use the Gemini API to create multi-agent workflows for processing data. It ensures that schemas remain consistent across various AI agents and LLMs, which is critical for data processing an extraction. While you might not use structured outputs as the average Android user, you'll certainly encounter software applications that leverage the Gemini API's newest features.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The smartphone represents a significant shift for OnePlus, partly driven by necessity.</p><p>Its camera deal with Hasselblad expired, so the brand pivoted, swapping out the camera sensors and switching to its own processing engine. Elsewhere, the OnePlus 15 features a new boxy design with a square camera bump and a new display with a lower resolution. It's all part of a new positioning for the OnePlus 15 as a gaming and performance-first handset, even if it required a few downgrades to achieve that.</p><p>That will make comparisons between the OnePlus 15 and older models like the OnePlus 12 tricky. Yes, the new model is expectedly to have the edge in overall performance and battery life. In other areas, the situation is different. The OnePlus 12 outperforms the OnePlus 15 in display quality and camera hardware, to start. So, which one should you buy? Let's compare the models to help you determine which one is best for you.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-12-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 12: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1108px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="9rkgtbMwWwGtbknLqAu9SL" name="oneplus-15-china-launch" alt="OnePlus 15 launches in China in three colorways" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9rkgtbMwWwGtbknLqAu9SL.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1108" height="554" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15's design will be inherently controversial. You could identify previous OnePlus phones from afar by their circular rear camera arrangement, curved body, and two-toned finishes. None of these characteristics is present on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-new-oneplus-15-launches-in-china">OnePlus 15</a>. The smartphone features a boxy, rectangular design with flat sides. There's also a squircle rear camera arrangement and pretty bland finish options.</p><p>In fact, it appears to be inspired by last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a>, which we described as "the compact iPhone clone you never wanted." The same may be true of the OnePlus 15, except for the bigger form factor. Many longtime OnePlus fans will be disappointed by the OnePlus 15's new design, which lacks uniqueness. Rounding out the design is a chassis that measures 161.42 x 76.67mm with a thickness of 8.2mm and weighs between 211 and 215 grams.</p><p>The older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is larger and thicker, measuring 9.1mm in thickness and weighing 220 grams, but it retains the fan-favorite OnePlus design language. You get an off-center circular camera bump and a curvy chassis. There are also more striking finish options available, such as Flowy Emerald and Silky Black.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GnPze5fyzHuLY7FMUtPGNY" name="oxygenos-15-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GnPze5fyzHuLY7FMUtPGNY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15's screen is slightly smaller than the OnePlus 12's display, but the difference will be negligible. The newer model's panel measures 6.78 inches, which is only 0.04 inches smaller than the 6.78-inch panel on the older model. The bigger difference will be in display resolution and refresh rate.</p><p>OnePlus aimed to offer a 165Hz refresh rate option on the OnePlus 15 for mobile gaming, which necessitated a reduction in the display's resolution. It has a 2,772 x 2,772 (1.5K) resolution, a downgrade compared to the OnePlus 12's 3,168 x 1,440 resolution display. However, the OnePlus 12 only has a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>OnePlus explained that 165Hz refresh rates aren't possible on a QHD+ display, and it had to choose between one or the other. It went with refresh rates, whereas the OnePlus 12 prioritizes display clarity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QUbzUyTTi9ciup6N6YXABb" name="oxygenos-15-10.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUbzUyTTi9ciup6N6YXABb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15 is superior in durability, with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a> that not only protects against liquid submersion but also high-pressure water jets.

Specs like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> and a 5,400mAh battery capacity still beat some flagships, namely the Google Pixel 10, in 2025.</p><p>The OnePlus 12 is also somewhat outdated in other areas, such as its limited support for IP65 water resistance. If you can look past that, though, there's a lot to like even two years later.</p><p>For everyone else, there's the OnePlus 15. It doesn't have the raw specs of older OnePlus phones, and clearly takes inspiration from the boxy designs of Samsung, Apple, and Google phones. However, let's remember that phones like the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 13 had a tendency to overemphasize specs. In many ways, the OnePlus 15 is a regression to the mean.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 remains an excellent phone, thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor and a 7,300mAh battery capacity, which allows it to do almost anything.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ac59e54d-0046-42ce-91ef-60619bdb0fcc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still outstanding</strong></em></p><p>With the OnePlus 15, the brand decided to go all-in on gaming and overall performance.

Supposedly, Samsung has contacted a supplier for the necessary components, but the purported amount may only be good for ~20,000 to ~30,000 Galaxy Z Trifold units.</p><p>The report adds that Samsung's trifold development will likely continue into December, where the publication's source claims "suppliers are expecting an update."</p><p>However, per its source, suppliers are hesitant to believe that Samsung will make another order for more components to craft more trifolds. Right now, it seems that Samsung is only looking to create an extremely limited number of Galaxy Z Trifolds, but the reason could be due to the market.</p><p>The publication adds that Samsung may start low to evaluate the phone's performance before thinking about more. We've heard something similar to this before, and there's likely another reason for the small amount.</p><h2 id="where-to-go-from-here-2">Where to go from here?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.57%;"><img id="4YTUmzQojfurFJVYsUyJHT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-2" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4YTUmzQojfurFJVYsUyJHT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="354" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just yesterday (Nov 5), we were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/this-could-be-your-best-look-yet-at-samsungs-new-galaxy-z-trifold">treated to the best look</a> we've ever gotten of the Galaxy Z Trifold. In a leaked video, Samsung's device was reportedly on full display, revealing its highly anticipated design. It was stated that the unit in question featured a 6.5-inch folded display, which expands to 10 inches when the phone is fully unfolded. However, it seems as though the phone boasts some pretty thick bezels.</p><p>Overall, its alleged design very closely mirrors the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This is something we've seen rumored previously, and this video only leans more into that possibility. Speaking of the Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">Samsung was scrambling</a> earlier this year to make more, as consumers flocked toward the newest model.</p><p>Samsung was reported to have placed orders to create roughly 260,000 more Fold 7 units in September, a 60,000-unit jump from its original plan.</p><p>This is a stark difference between how it saw the Fold 7, and what's been rumored for the Trifold's low 20,000 to 30,000 (alleged) production plan. There are rumors that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/not-launching-its-trifold-phone-in-the-us-is-the-smart-move-by-samsung">might skip the U.S.</a> when it launches its Trifold, and the reason's pretty simple: pricing. There's speculation that the device could reach upwards of $2,500 in the U.S., and a price point like that would surely make consumers furrow their eyebrows.</p><p>Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand also anticipates that there might be some issues with the Trifold, just on the basis that it will be a first-gen model. Hildenbrand also speculates that Samsung might keep the Trifold in Asian markets just as a test, considering the market is a mix of early adopters and simply curious folk.</p><p>Some rumors claim Samsung will debut the device late in 2025, though others say 2026 is more likely.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Yes, like the woman who can't get up and needs a LifeAlert product, that kind of fall detection.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a1678fa3-c4c2-483e-9760-b459c6355951" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D913TDZD/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="whBbwAg9hrdDn5WvWdWcTK" name="Google Pixel Watch 3" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whBbwAg9hrdDn5WvWdWcTK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel Watch 3:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D913TDZD/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1W3KGJ2MZP5I0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.u8TZQk5kREH3WHiCcty7gV7loZLSyrpeBGpHHEPwVaFcfuPHTLHPp3-M6uL7NGH25NWG3g2R7SVQuo_p-om2E3qkx-3MJdUxNWe_KaabDtHvKAfejXozrFy6yMjw0CRe9_8OsqLxx799CxxI8ji-uGF-AIZC2K-alx_xwJL8Cuk436znGSOoeQq4qKrPVyzJj7COmCX6RHWNF0Z3ueH57Au3tpqC-KVybBrIsKIG_rM.NwgOmNjeZtY4WzB4Lcgq0DWvMnLW0PCxGeEPt8LDi3s&dib_tag=se&keywords=pixel%2Bwatch%2B3&qid=1762454175&sprefix=pixel%2Bwatch%2B3%2Caps%2C106&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1" target="_blank" data-dimension112="a1678fa3-c4c2-483e-9760-b459c6355951" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" data-dimension25=""><del>$299</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday are only weeks away, but Amazon is selling what I need at a price I like.

Don't feel sorry for me because I did this to myself by being a dumbass, and I didn't die; life is generally good, and it forced me to grow up at 30 years old. I'm not paralyzed, though. As time goes by, severe damage to my bones and nerves is forcing me to live more of my life sitting down, but I can still walk a bit.</p><p>I'm also stubborn. My office is in the basement and I like having it in the basement. I have my "own" bathroom, easy access to the backyard, and it gives me privacy and peace while I'm trying to work. Getting to the basement is a different story because of the stairs. Stairs are my kryptonite, both up and down.</p><p>I only know if my legs are moving if I am looking at them. I can even step on a Lego and feel no pain. Legs that feel "dead" and stairs mean I fall down. A lot. So far, I've not broken anything or knocked myself out, but both my Doctor and my wife know that it could easily happen, and reluctantly, I even have to admit I could end up at the bottom of he steps, out cold and in need of help. I need something that can call for that help if I need it, but I'm not about to wear something marketed for senior citizens. I need a wearable with reliable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-explains-fall-detection">fall detection</a>, like the Pixel Watch 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1278px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="rzj5VNuWbDsjj5ZWgmbNkT" name="Wheelchair-wheels-cropped.jpg" alt="Wheelchair wheels" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzj5VNuWbDsjj5ZWgmbNkT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1278" height="718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know that the Pixel Watch 3 isn't the newest smartwatch from Google or the only wearable that offers fall detection. I also know that Black Friday and its mountain of tech sales are just a few weeks away.</p><p>I also know that if you need something, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-phone-frenzy-buy-now-or-bide-your-time">you should buy it when you see it at the right price</a> and have no regrets. I fell three times last week. I can't wait and don't want to do the smart thing and move my office upstairs.</p><p>I know my situation is different than most, but it's similar in some ways. When we have an immediate need, it's great when we can fill it and save a bunch of money. I'll miss the accuracy and battery life of my Garmin Venu 3, but I'm not going to complain about having a new shiny gadget to mess with.</p><p>And if I take a more serious tumble, I can get the help I need.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The RedMagic 11 Pro recently joined the list, bringing with it something that none of its rivals can offer: liquid cooling. Between the Gen 5's performance gains over last year's model, and RedMagic's focus on mobile gaming, needless to say that the phone will end up generating a bunch of heat.</p><p>Recently, Zack Nelson from JerryRigEverything got his hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic/redmagic-just-dropped-a-gaming-phone-with-a-literal-water-cooler-inside">RedMagic 11 Pro</a>, and put it through his gauntlet of torture tests. Unlike other phones that were recently released, the 11 Pro passed with flying colors. As for the results, the display begins to scratch at a level 6 on the Mohs scale, with "deeper grooves at a level 7."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/826O9YGrGCg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>When holding a lighter to the screen, it took about 20 seconds or so to see that portion of the screen turn white. However, just a few moments later, and the AMOLED display "recovered," and you couldn't even tell where the burn initially occurred.</p><p>Nelson's bend tests are notorious for finding flaws with devices, as we recently saw with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-fold-smokes-up-and-explodes-during-jres-durability-test">Pixel 10 Pro Fold actually exploding</a>. RedMagic fans can rest easy, as the 11 Pro barely even flexed when pressure was applied to both the front and the back.</p><p>Moving onto the star of the show, Zack carefully removed the back glass that covers the entire rear of the phone, and few moments later, the entire liquid cooling loop was exposed. It wasn't until the phone was turned off and the loop was disconnected from the phone that it stopped entirely, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jPCyFKsHWYDqw8Eky4QGof" name="redmagic-11-pro-jre-teardown-screen-burn" alt="Screen burn test on the RedMagic 11 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jPCyFKsHWYDqw8Eky4QGof.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4112" height="2314" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JerryRigEverything)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's worth pointing out that when looking at the liquid cooling, you'll see some bubbles that aren't the same color as the blue liquid. Although we aren't sure as to the reason why this was done, it could just be for aesthetics otherwise the liquid cooling loop would just look blue all of the time.</p><p>Speaking of which, I have to agree with Zack here, as he's not sure why RedMagic didn't just have the majority of the loop shown. It makes the phone even more unique than it already is, and looks pretty darn cool at the same time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3198px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AayYrLzxUG3PpHpyJyHcye" name="redmagic-11-pro-liquid-cooling-teardown-jre-1" alt="Liquid cooling loop teardown on RedMagic 11 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AayYrLzxUG3PpHpyJyHcye.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3198" height="1799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JerryRigEverything)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After finishing the disassembly of the RedMagic 11 Pro, Nelson manages to get everything put back together and turns the phone back on without any issues. While this isn't something that everyone should try to do, it's nice seeing how well-built these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phones</a> really are. And if anything, it provides a bit of reassurance that your phone won't break under a bit of pressure or if you happen to drop it.</p><p>Pre-orders for the RedMagic 11 Pro are slated to kick off on November 13, with the base model priced at $749. For that, you'll get the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. However, you can also configure the phone with up to 24GB of RAM and a whopping 1TB of storage.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="bd1b30c5-033b-4448-ae36-a2f054257014">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGo9MTjPB4ZuTwds2Hp6ET.png' alt="back side of the RedMagic 11 Pro in silver"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">RedMagic 11 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Mobile gaming, embodied</strong></em></p><p>If you really want to see what the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is capable of, especially with gaming, then the RedMagic 11 Pro is the phone for you.

However, we may have new information about the phone from the source itself. Samsung seems to have teased the Galaxy S26 during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-zuckerberg-predicts-when-ai-glasses-will-be-profitable">recent earnings call,</a> suggesting that it would feature an Exynos AP (mobile application processors) and use improved camera sensors. (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-spec-confirmation-q3-2025-earnings-3611552/">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>During the Q3 earnings call, Daniel Araujo, VP of Samsung’s mobile experience division, said that the Galaxy S26 lineup will “revolutionize the user experience with user-centric, next-gen AI, a second-generation custom AP, and stronger performance, including new camera sensors.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This essentially means that the Galaxy S26 lineup will indeed have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600</a>, which was rumored to be the case at least in some regions, while the rest of the world might see the Snapdragon chipset specifically designed for Galaxy models, like its predecessor. Following up on the chipset question, Araujo said that “for the Galaxy S26, the AP (chipset) evaluation is still underway, so we can’t yet confirm our next year’s flagship lineup.”</p><p>Additionally, Araujo also hinted at possible hardware changes coming to the Galaxy S26 series, giving it new camera sensors this time around. Since the company has stuck to the same rear camera lenses since the Galaxy S22. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26#section-samsung-galaxy-s26-will-get-huge-imaging-upgrades">Previous leaks suggest</a> that the company plans to retain the 200MP HP9 primary camera.</p><p>However, it could also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-spec-confirmation-q3-2025-earnings-3611552/">incorporate a newer sensor</a> for the 3x zoom, which should enhance image quality. Both the primary and 5x cameras are also anticipated to benefit from a faster aperture, meaning better low-light images are in the books.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy S26 Ultra sensors debugged details:200MP HP250MP JN3 ultrawide12MP S5K3LD 3x tele50MP IMX854 peris 5x12MP IMX874 selfieOnly change this time is the traditional 10MP 3x 1/1.39 size sensor is replaced by newer 12MP K3LD.

According to the tipster, Samsung will supposedly use the same rear camera sensors on the S26 Ultra as the S25 Ultra. Only the 3x telephoto lens will get an upgrade to a 12MP S5K3LD sensor. That said, the rumor suggests that it could be the same size as the 10MP sensor, making for little to no change.</p><p>The S26 series is rumored to feature APV codec video recording, offering two modes: APV HQ and APV LQ. APV HQ will consume 1.5GB per minute of video, whereas APV LQ will use 750MB for the same duration.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, it's no surprise that the next range of devices will come packed with Galaxy AI, and as Araujo mentioned, the next-gen AI could be even more intuitive, adapting to the users' needs. As we've seen in multiple leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to heavily leverage AI, as the company is supposedly developing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-5-get-to-the-point-faster-ai-notification-summaries">"Notification Summaries," </a>Privacy display, offering presets for Pro camera controls, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

On its way to "more than 60 markets" globally, Spotify says these stats will be accessible via your <strong>profile icon > listening stats</strong>. What you can expect is a weekly overview of "your top artists and songs from the past four weeks."</p><p>The platform states that aside from reliving what you've been jamming to, your listening stats will also deliver personalized highlights. These highlights will include listening milestones, fan moments, "a new discovery," and what makes your listening unique.</p><p>Though personal, Spotify says your weekly listening stats are shareable, too.</p><p>The entire week's stats or simply a condensed highlight can be shared with others through Spotify or in other apps, like Instagram and WhatsApp. The new Listening Stats will provide playlists inspired by your recent week's listening habits, as well as song suggestions that you might want to check. Users can look at listening stats as a miniature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-your-spotify-2020-wrapped-apple-music-replay-youtube-music-year-review">end-of-the-year Wrapped</a>, which Spotify itself alludes to.</p><p>Still, for those chunkier stats, you'll have to wait for the year's end for that colorful overview.</p><h2 id="stats-for-what-s-been-on-your-mind-2">Stats for what's been on your mind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="9F4k6fxnRwb5hkPJ9F6NQ7" name="spotify-weekly-listening-stats-overview" alt="Spotify's weekly "listening stats" shows the user what songs they've been hearing on repeat, as well as the dates the overview covers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9F4k6fxnRwb5hkPJ9F6NQ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spotify's listening stats should start rolling out to Android devices soon, considering the announcement came late this week.

Additionally, the DJ will also display a few suggested prompts to get you started, if you're unsure of where to begin.</p><p>On the lines of AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-in-chatgpt-android-create-entire-playlists-without-lifting-a-finger">Spotify and ChatGPT got together</a>, giving users the choice of merging their accounts, so the AI can play songs for them.

Getting it there is only half the battle, though, because once you've received it, the way it appears can make all the difference. We've all seen websites that have a different layout or format based on the device you're using (you're on one right now!), but what makes it work? Are you tagged and tracked across the internet so that everyone with a web presence knows whether you're using a phone or a laptop?</p><p>Thankfully, no. It's a complicated process made simple for the people building the browser by placing all the work on the web host, called a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/win7appqual/user-agent-string" target="_blank">User Agent String</a>.</p><p>Every bit of software capable of perusing the contents of a website has a UAS. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whats-your-favorite-web-browser-2020">web browser</a> you are using right now has one, AI content scrapers have one, and even some web browser extensions have one.

This is a small line of text that your web browser (such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) automatically sends to the website/web server with every request.

As with most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a>, there's a good bit of fine print involved, so let's break it all down. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0d3ad032-b699-4ccc-acd8-46d5eb9a58bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon" data-dimension48="Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon" href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100048248-17161891?sid=hawk-custom-tracking" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bGnN5XZnLzieRfbffhXSLD" name="verizon-2024-logo-sq.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGnN5XZnLzieRfbffhXSLD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="426" height="426" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100048248-17161891?sid=hawk-custom-tracking" data-dimension112="0d3ad032-b699-4ccc-acd8-46d5eb9a58bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label='Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon' data-dimension48='Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon' data-dimension25=""><strong>Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon</strong></a></p><p>Join Verizon 5G Home Internet with the 5G Home Ultimate plan and you'll get to choose between a free QLED Samsung TV, Nintendo Switch gaming console, or the powerful Galaxy Tab S10 FE tablet. </p><p>Verizon 5G Home Internet plans also let you choose between a number of excellent perks for $10 per month, including a popular streaming bundle that consists of Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus.

The advantage is that 5G Home Internet is affordable, easy to install, and if you live in an area with good 5G coverage, just as fast as traditional broadband. </p><p>Verizon's 5G Home Ultimate plan is the best that the internet provider has to offer, giving customers unlimited premium data, Ultra HD 4K streaming, and a free Wi-Fi extender to cover your entire home. You'll also get a five-year price lock, 30-day money-back guarantee, and no hidden fees or confusing setup costs. </p><p>And of course, like Verizon's best wireless plans, you get to mix and match entertainment perks every month for $10 apiece. These benefits range from unlimited cloud storage to streaming services, including the Disney Plus Bundle. That means you're getting Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus for 50% off its usual cost, so if you're missing out on live sports following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-disney-stalemate-continues-as-neither-side-agrees-to-end-the-blackout">the YouTube TV/Disney Plus fallout</a>, now's your chance to enjoy all of the action for cheap. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1116px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xpaiD26Mm37GnjCSnTdRq3" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-playing-games-lifestyle" alt="Lifestyle image of someone playing games on the Galaxy Tab S10 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xpaiD26Mm37GnjCSnTdRq3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1116" height="628" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, the perks here are nice, but the Verizon 5G Home Internet deal's biggest selling point is the free gift. The options include a 43-inch Samsung Q7F QLED TV (a $399.99 value), a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE</a> tablet ($599.99), or a Nintendo Switch ($339.99). All you need to do is sign up for the aforementioned 5G Home Ultimate plan and use it for six months without missing a payment or cancelling the service.</p><p>Verizon's 5G Home Ultimate plan starts at $85 per month, but you can easily drop the price down to $60 per month by using AutoPay and bundling your internet service with one of Verizon's wireless plans. Members who bundle internet with mobile service will also get a complimentary perk, which means you might get the Disney Plus Bundle for completely free. </p><p>This deal may not be for everyone, but if you live in an area with good 5G access and you're looking to switch internet providers anyway, this is a great way to do it AND get some discounted (or free) entertainment out of the deal. With the holidays swiftly approaching, that's just the kind of break I need. </p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Then we've got the podcast for you! I sat down with 9to5Google's Will Sattelberg this past week to discuss the launch of Android XR, the Galaxy XR, and everything those products mean for the future of XR on the November 3, 2025 edition of The Sideload podcast.</p><p>When Will asked me to be a guest on the show, I knew there was no way I could turn it down. We've been covering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Samsung Galaxy XR</a> in depth at Android Central since before the launch, getting our hands on the elusive headset three times before it went to retail.</p><p>I also write a weekly XR-centric column called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">AC thVRsday</a> that goes live on, you guessed it, Thursdays. If you're not familiar with the term XR, it stands for eXtended Reality and covers the gamut of AR and VR devices. That's everything from smart glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> to full-fledged, premium VR headsets like Samsung's newly launched Galaxy XR.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdLcfdKHUPc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>If you're looking for something specific, Will was kind enough to list out the timestamps for all the major topics:</p><ul><li>00:00:00 – Intro</li><li>00:01:02 – Nick’s VR experience</li><li>00:10:04 – Galaxy VR</li><li>00:23:20 – Samsung’s current-gen rivals</li><li>00:35:32 – Where VR excels</li><li>00:48:03 – Smart glasses</li><li>01:06:48 – Laser Dance</li><li>01:11:16 – Wrap-up</li></ul><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> is a brand new version of Android built specifically for XR devices, and while the Galaxy XR mixed reality headset is the first Android XR device to market, we're expecting a treasure trove of smart glasses to use the operating system next year.</p><p>That includes companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-we-want-to-see-from-samsung-android-xr-glasses">like Samsung</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-android-xr-glasses-project-aura-meta-orion-similar">Xreal</a>, who are expected to debut a wide range of products including display-less AI glasses and even full-fledged AR glasses. What are your thoughts on XR, as a whole? Are you excited about smart glasses, can't wait to get a top-notch VR headset, or have another opinion? Let us know!

To catch up, Apple seems ready to use a solution from an unexpected source: Google.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> report says Apple is about to sign a deal to pay around $1 billion each year for a custom version of Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> model. This model has about 1.2 trillion parameters, while Apple’s current model has about 150 billion.</p><p>Apple reportedly plans to run this Gemini-based model on its own Private Cloud Compute servers. This means Google supplies the model, while Apple keeps it behind its own walls to preserve its privacy narrative. The revamped Siri is expected to roll out in spring 2026, possibly as part of iOS 26.4.</p><p>This move also shows that Apple recognizes its AI models are not yet ready. Earlier this year, Apple looked at other AI partners, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, before choosing Google. The deal does not mean Google’s search engine or brand will appear in Apple’s interface; most of the integration will happen in the background.</p><h2 id="temporary-boost-2">Temporary boost</h2><p>For Apple, this is a smart temporary solution. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">gets access to a powerful model now</a> while it works on its own future AI. The report says Apple is developing its own cloud-based model with about 1 trillion parameters.</p><p>However, there are caveats. The agreement isn’t fully public yet, so details might change. And while more parameters usually mean stronger models, user experience depends on a lot more than just size — datasets, latency, privacy, integration all matter. Also, Apple has had AI-feature delays before.</p><p>If the deal pans out, Siri <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-should-ditch-siri-for-gemini-and-google-cloud-heres-why">could become much more capable</a> by spring 2026, thanks to Google’s AI. The $1 billion per year price may make heads turn, but since Apple is catching up in AI, paying for access makes sense right now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You may experience a shorter estimate if you get more notifications than I do, or if you're actively using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> or other apps simultaneously.</p><p>With those disclaimers out of the way, Pixel Watch 4 battery life has felt very consistent and dependable across weeks of testing. I find that the Watch 4 45mm nearly always reaches Google's 40-hour estimate with AOD active, with battery to spare. Unless you're frequently streaming music or using GPS, it's reasonable to assume you'll hit two days per charge.</p><p>I used GPS most frequently for my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-fitness-test">Pixel Watch 4 fitness testing</a>, coming away impressed with its minimal impact on overall battery life, despite its increased accuracy with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-4-dual-band-gps-exclusive-interview">dual-frequency tracking</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="EPY2TgsYeaYsDeMCVa7tWR" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-run-activity-hr-zone" alt="Close-up of the Google Pixel Watch 4 showing the HR zone run view, with a "time in zone" stat in red, with a "peak" HR of 172 below it, then the current run time in white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EPY2TgsYeaYsDeMCVa7tWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Long workouts are no problem on the Pixel Watch 4 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Central contributor Tshaka Armstrong also has the Pixel Watch 4 45mm, and he told me he's "been getting around 42 hours battery life with an hour or more of GPS and an hour of streaming to earbuds." If you subtract the 20% or so of battery that his workout and streaming used, that means he made the Watch 4 last as long as Google's estimate, with only 80% power.</p><p>The biggest battery drain for the Watch 4 occurs when you use cellular data and GPS simultaneously. If you're a serious athlete who wants to leave your phone behind while streaming music, consider pre-downloading your playlists whenever possible and saving cellular data for emergencies.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="kauSMFJeBaJnop6KJQjGWG" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-music-playback-controls" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 on a wrist outdoors, showing music playback controls for a Pandora playlist." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kauSMFJeBaJnop6KJQjGWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, you can make the Watch 4 last for a few hours even with heavy-duty usage, which is impressive.</p><p>On a <em>typical</em> workday where the Watch 4 isn't doing much besides showing notifications and tracking heart rate, it has excellent standby battery life. I've found that it tends to use about 15% of its power in eight "normal" hours, and even less at night. I'll typically end up with 10–15% power after 48 hours.</p><p>You'll use apps like Gemini that eat up that extra power, but it's nice to see how efficiently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> runs, combined with the more efficient <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a> chip.</p><p>Equally important, the Pixel Watch 4 recharges absurdly fast thanks to the new Quick Charge Dock. Google estimates it'll take an hour to recharge the Watch 4 45mm, and it's typically much quicker unless you're charging it from a completely dead battery. For example, I plugged it in at 9% power, and it took 42 minutes to hit 100%.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-the-pixel-watch-4-45mm-for-extra-battery-life-2">Should you buy the Pixel Watch 4 45mm for extra battery life?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3895px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xxECTZggiFniCMYYhC5Prb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-colors-and-sizes-2" alt="Three Pixel Watch 4 models next to each other in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xxECTZggiFniCMYYhC5Prb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3895" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4 45mm isn't as long-lasting as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, but it's more comfortable than either of those bulky models. But you may still prefer the Watch 4 41mm, which is about 12g lighter and $50 cheaper.</p><p>If we trust Google's estimate that the Pixel Watch 4 41mm lasts about three-quarters as long, we can infer that demanding apps will have a slightly disproportionate effect, especially when using cellular data.</p><p>Take any number in the table above and multiply it by 3/4: I'd bet the Pixel Watch 4 41mm would offer about 7 hours of GPS, 6 hours of Bluetooth streaming, or only 2.5 hours of combined GPS and LTE music streaming. These are only guesses, but they're logical ones.</p><p>More broadly, while the Pixel Watch 4 45mm can be stretched to last <em>close</em> to two days per charge, the Pixel Watch 4 41mm will still die somewhere in the middle of day two, unless you're conscientious about charging it regularly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="G4GtXkThPfe5ifEhCKQzGm" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Quick-Charge-Dock" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 4 held in hand with the Quick Charge Dock magnetically attached to the bottom." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G4GtXkThPfe5ifEhCKQzGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, the speedy charging makes this simple. If you charge your Watch 4 every day while showering, you can top it off and barely spend any time <em>without</em> wearing it. If you're looking to save money, the 41mm option isn't a bad choice; I'd only advise against it if you're considering the LTE option, because the 45mm Watch's extra battery life really helps on that front.</p><p>I like the 45mm option because those extra ten hours of battery let me worry less about charging in general, and because Wear OS reflows content to show more info on larger screens.

No, that's not because I <em>love </em>using iPhones — quite the opposite, really. It was because I couldn't wait to test out the spatial photo and video capture that comes built-in to the phone's camera app.</p><p>You see, when Apple launched the Vision Pro in 2024, it understood that most people with a Vision Pro wouldn't wear them on their heads 24/7 and, therefore, wouldn't use its powerful spatial cameras to capture everyday memories. That type of experience is reserved for the phones in our pockets, and recent iPhone models can capture this kind of content.</p><p>On the Android side of things, the only way to capture spatial photos or video is to buy an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreals-new-ar-glass-companion-brings-android-apps-to-life-in-3d">Xreal Beam Pro</a>. This neat little gadget is perfect when paired with a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> glasses, and it's also perfect for capturing spatial photos and video of any kind throughout your day. The obvious problem is that it's a second device you'd have to remember to charge and take with you at all times, and that's just not realistic for most people.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

The new OS can run <strong>all</strong> Android apps in VR space, making it the best new XR operating system and outpacing both Meta and Apple in this particular metric.</p><p>Galaxy XR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/should-you-buy-samsung-galaxy-xr">is an entertainment powerhouse</a>, and one of the pillars Google touts of this experience is the ability to view 3D — better known as "spatial" these days — photos and video right in the headset. The problem is that no modern Android phone can record 3D photos or videos, just the ancient EVO 3D and, of course, the Xreal Beam Pro sidekick device.</p><p>Google attempted to solve this problem through the magic of AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10007528/">by automatically converting</a> existing 2D photos and videos to 3D, but the end result isn't quite as good as if it were captured natively with a binocular phone camera system.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="Gv6yJamw2UERMyruuRvWAD" name="spatial-iphone" alt="Importing spatial video from an iPhone to a Meta Quest is seamless" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gv6yJamw2UERMyruuRvWAD.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="426" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta introduced a similar feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-beats-android-xr-makes-instagram-scrolling-spatial">back in May</a>, which includes automatically converting Instagram content to 3D as you scroll. The effect is quite impressive, although again, it's not <em>quite</em> as good as if you were watching native 3D or spatial content.</p><p>For that, you'll need an iPhone 15, 16, or newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17</a>. Not only do these phones capture spatial photos and video impressively well, but the Meta Horizon app makes it dead simple to import them onto your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest</a> headset.</p><p>To do this, open the Meta Horizon app on your iPhone, select the menu button in the top-left corner, tap gallery, then click the upload button in the top right. Once you give the app access to your camera roll, you can slide over to the Spatial tab and easily select any spatial photos and videos you've captured on your iPhone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.41%;"><img id="8445ekW5tK9XpfasxPrHNj" name="meta-quest-app-spatial-photo-upload" alt="Uploading spatial photos and videos from an iPhone to the Meta Horizon app for viewing on a Meta Quest headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8445ekW5tK9XpfasxPrHNj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1483" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the Android side of things, the instructions are the same, but there's no Spatial tab to be seen. Even on the Xreal Beam Pro, I don't have a Spatial option, as the app doesn't recognize the 3D side-by-side content the device captures as "spatial" photos or video. Rather, it thinks these are panoramas, and that's reflected in the in-headset experience.</p><p>Now, I can load a gallery app on the Meta Quest that allows me to view side-by-side photos as 3D images, but I have no way of natively viewing them with the built-in gallery app or uploading 3D video natively through the Meta Horizon app. That all seems to be locked to iOS because of Apple's official spatial capture standard.</p><h2 id="another-green-bubble-for-android-2">Another green bubble for Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oPorpRcWL9JiUBBdQm2cD4" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-3d-camera-option" alt="Enabling the Android XR-compatible 3D recording feature on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oPorpRcWL9JiUBBdQm2cD4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is where Google needs to catch up. Without a properly supported standard, Android users are effectively stuck in "green bubble land" again, just using a different subject matter. At the very least, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-3d-capture-shows-up-xr-headset-we-dont-have-yet">introduced a hidden feature</a> in its Camera Assistant app that lets you capture 3D pictures and video specifically for Galaxy XR, but I don't understand why Samsung wants to hide it so badly. This should be a standard mode or feature on <em>all</em> Samsung phones.</p><p>The worst part is that Samsung has already one-upped Apple by offering users high-quality selections for 3D video and photos. Even better, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> can capture 4K spatial video, while even the mighty iPhone 17 Pro Max tops out at 1080p. Again, why hide such a fantastic feature? I just don't get it.</p><p>The images I captured using this feature on a Galaxy S25 Ultra upload just fine to the Meta Quest app, but videos aren't selectable at all yet. That one's on Meta, but it still shows that Android users have to jump through unnecessary hoops to get a second-rate experience compared to how things are on an iPhone, and I <strong>hate</strong> that.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You can find it by tapping your profile icon > Gift Cards, or by simply searching for “gift cards” in the app. From there, users can browse through available brands, select an amount, personalize the message, and send the card straight to someone’s email address or phone number.</p><p>According to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/16585331" target="_blank">support page</a>, most cards are delivered within an hour, though in some cases it can take up to 24 hours.</p><p>The move makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play-download-manage-apps">Play Store</a> a more flexible digital gifting hub. While users have long been able to buy Google Play balance cards, this new rollout adds third-party brand cards to the mix, meaning you can send a Starbucks or Disney gift card as easily as topping up your Play Store credits.</p><h2 id="strict-regional-and-usage-limits-apply-2">Strict regional and usage limits apply</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PwTCf9vyKJxtkDf6YBFTF7" name="Google-Play-Store-hero-AC.jpg" alt="Google Play Store homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PwTCf9vyKJxtkDf6YBFTF7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, the feature comes with clear boundaries. For one, gift cards can’t be used across countries. So, a U.S.-bought card, for instance, won’t work if you try to redeem it in another region. Likewise, Google strictly prohibits reselling, trading, or converting gift cards to cash.</p><p>Also, these cards can’t be used to buy other gift cards or for business purposes. These limitations are in place to prevent misuse and fraud.</p><p>When it comes to buying, Google outlines some key details on its official support page. Digital gift cards can be purchased directly from the Play Store, but users can’t use their existing Play balance or Play Points to pay for them, and buying them doesn’t earn you extra Play Points either.</p><p>Each country also has its own purchase limit of around $250 per day in the U.S., £250 in the U.K., and roughly MXN $5,000 in Mexico. If you receive a digital card, you can redeem it by following the link sent to you via email or SMS. Cards from outside Google Play (such as Starbucks or Adidas) must be redeemed according to each brand’s specific instructions.</p><p>Google is also reminding users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-flags-new-wave-of-online-scams-fueled-by-ai-fakes-and-holiday-hustles">stay alert to gift card scams</a>, a common problem in which bad actors pose as legitimate companies or individuals and request payment via gift cards.</p><p>The company stresses one simple rule: if someone asks you to pay them with a Google Play gift card, it’s a scam. Google doesn’t ask for gift cards as payment for any product or service, and users are advised never to share their redemption codes with anyone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A recent Google advisory explains how these criminals are working right now.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/fraud-and-scams-advisory-november-2025/" target="_blank">advisory</a>, scammers are upgrading their playbook using AI tools to make their tricks look painfully real. From fake job listings to malicious VPN apps, the scams are multiplying fast and preying on anyone who lets their guard down online.</p><p>Google highlights fake job offers as a major trend. Scammers pretend to be big companies by copying their career pages, posing as recruiters, and posting fake government jobs. Google says they often ask for “processing fees” or get people to download fake interview software that steals information. Remember, real employers never ask for money or banking details before hiring.</p><p>Business owners aren’t off the hook either. A newer scam making waves involves “review extortion,” where attackers flood a business with one-star reviews and then demand money to remove them.</p><p>Google provides a direct way for merchants to report these extortion attempts straight from their profiles.</p><h2 id="ai-impersonation-scams-are-on-the-rise-2">AI impersonation scams are on the rise</h2><p>Then there’s the booming category of AI impersonation scams. Fraudsters are faking websites and apps pretending to be “exclusive” or “free” versions of popular AI tools. The endgame is always the same — install malware, steal credentials, or push overpriced “fleeceware” subscriptions.</p><p>Google says its AI-powered Safe Browsing and Play Store policies are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-says-android-phones-block-more-scams-than-iphones">catching many of these</a>, but users should still double-check URLs and only download from official sources.</p><p>Other warnings include malicious VPN apps disguised as privacy tools but actually loaded with malware, fraud recovery scams targeting people who’ve already been scammed, and holiday shopping scams that ramp up during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday with fake storefronts and “too-good-to-be-true” deals.</p><p>Google’s Trust & Safety team says scammers are becoming quicker, smarter, and more widespread, but defenses are improving too. With real-time scam detection in Google Messages and Gmail, plus better AI-based browser protections, the company hopes these tools can protect users before they get hurt.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We first heard about the AYANEO Pocket Vert <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gpBmFdgeYJ8?si=9xkD4C64N4UJske_">back in July</a> during the company's "Strategy Sharing Session" livestream. Now, we're getting our first look at the handheld, along with a few other key details.</p><p>The Pocket Vert will be AYANEO's first vertical handheld to be released since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-dmg-pocket-micro-launch">Pocket DMG</a>, which arrived in 2023. Since its release, the DMG quickly became a favorite in the community, even with its higher asking price. AYANEO is hoping to recapture some of that magic with the Vert, but in a completely different way.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VlfPHwsNrnY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>What made the Pocket DMG so enticing was its clear homage to the original Game Boy, especially with the Retro Power color. Not only that, but the DMG is powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, giving you flagship gaming power in a vertical-styled handheld, which is something we never thought we'd see.</p><p>With the Pocket Vert, AYANEO is taking a slightly different course of action, focusing on a refined and ultra-premium design. AYANEO is ditching the plastic in favor of a "CNC-milled Unibody," complete with what it's calling "Diamond-cut shoulder buttons."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yHPHZeaL3W5ovDJHwYcTud" name="ayaneo-pocket-vert-diamond-cut-rear-buttons-1" alt="Close-up on "Diamond Cut Shoulder Buttons" on the AYANEO Pocket Vert" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yHPHZeaL3W5ovDJHwYcTud.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, the aluminum build and "diamond-like" buttons aren't the only reason why the Pocket Vert stands out. The 3.5-inch IPS display might just be the sharpest display we've ever seen on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android device</a>. The panel features a 1600 x 1440 resolution, equating to a 615 PPI. This also means that you'll be able to play original Game Boy games at a 10x pixel perfect resolution.</p><p>Since AYANEO's video gave us a look at the entire design, there's no denying that it's definitely going to stand out.

Per the report, the company's Mobile eXperience division (MX) is putting its foot down by saying it is targeting an "annual sales target" of 35 million units for the Galaxy S26 series in 2026.</p><p>It appears that Samsung is quite confident in its S26 series, though the report doesn't break down how many units per model it expects to sell (the Ultra's probably up there, if anything). However, what the report does expand on is revenue, which could reportedly climb to roughly $90.7 billion (~130 trillion won).</p><p>This revenue expectation (or hope) is reportedly being seen as a "meaningful growth" if Samsung can hit it next year. The company is not only looking at its S26 series to carry it, but also its 2026 foldable line.</p><p>Samsung is reportedly looking to sell roughly 5 million foldable units, a number that will likely span the next Galaxy Z Flip and Fold combined. We'll have to see if the next Fold outshines the Flip next year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">like it did earlier this year</a>.</p><h2 id="already-looking-to-the-new-year-2">Already looking to the new year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rumors about the Galaxy S26 series have been trickling in, especially a recent report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-ultra-s-pen-might-ditch-the-boxy-look-for-softer-curves">about its Ultra model's S Pen</a>. It's been speculated that the next S Pen could drop its boxy appearance for something a little softer. Those flat edges may disappear, as Samsung could dip into a "curvier" design for its S26 Ultra S Pen. As far as theories go, there's nothing just yet about new features.</p><p>Moreover, rumors claim that the S26 Ultra could be the end of an era, as Samsung may not return the S Pen again. The device, since it slots into the device, gets in the way of its battery and hardware specifications.</p><p>When it comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-locked-in-the-galaxy-s26-launch-date">to <em>when </em>we could see</a> the Galaxy S26 series debut, rumors have varied, but one report seems confident. It's not been rumored that the series could pop up on February 25, 2026, during Samsung's Unpacked event in San Francisco, California. Supposedly, the event is eyeing San Francisco due to its close ties to AI software. Additionally, the rumors are back to suggesting the series could feature a base model, an S26 Plus, and an S26 Ultra (no Pro or Edge).</p> ]]></dc:content>

Following the removal of these channels from YouTube TV, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-is-giving-users-usd10-credit">Google started issuing credits</a> to subscribers as compensation.</p><h2 id="subscribers-miss-out-on-key-sports-and-election-coverage-2">Subscribers miss out on key sports and election coverage</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ" name="YouTube-TV-logo" alt="YouTube TV logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Users took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1omidwp/youtube_tv_says_disney_unnecessarily_aggressive/">Reddit</a> to vent, filled with disappointment and uncertainty, and one of them stated that they're extremely unhappy with the way things have been playing out.</p><p>"Disney wants to funnel any viewers who want to watch CBB/CFB to ESPN+/Fubo/Hulu, and now I can't watch football this weekend, and if they don't figure out the contract dispute by early next week, I won't be able to watch UK's season opener.

According to DirecTV, consumers left in the dark by YouTube TV's ongoing negotiations can hop into its "Genre Packs." With this pack, it states viewers will find access to shows like <em>Dancing with the Stars </em>and major sports events, like college basketball.</p><p>Vince Torres, chief marketing officer at DIRECTV, states, "With options for free TV, specialized Genre Packs, and comprehensive streaming solutions all on our new and improved experience, DIRECTV makes it easy for consumers to watch what they want, how they want, and when they want. Consumers are taking notice and value our new, reliable, and simple streaming experience."</p><p>Torres also states that DirecTV provides a simple, single platform for viewers just looking to watch what they want. Viewers can do this easily, as DirecTV breaks things down into three important categories: MySports, MyNews, and MyEntertainment. Each one focuses on your favorite sports, elections, world news, and the most popular shows on the air.</p><p>DirecTV highlights its "five-day risk-free trial," which makes it easy for consumers who want to see if the service is worth keeping around.</p><h2 id="directv-shows-up-with-the-content-2">DirecTV shows up with the content</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ" name="YouTube-TV-logo" alt="YouTube TV logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>DirecTV was making headlines late in October, as it partnered with Google TV to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-reportedly-heads-for-hotels-with-directv-and-a-fully-customized-look">completely revamp and revitalize TV</a> in hotels. DirecTV wants to bring its new "Advanced Entertainment Platform" (AEP) to hotel rooms, a customizable platform that lets hotels tailor it to their needs. Google TV serves as the backbone to this, bringing the streaming services and apps that visitors will seek to tune into.</p><p>More importantly, users can even sign into their hotel TV with their Google account to access their shows. The post states that their information will be wiped to ensure their privacy remains secure.</p><p>As far as the YouTube TV angle goes, Disney's content was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-may-lose-espn-abc-as-disney-delivers-a-stern-warning">on the verge of a total blackout</a> for the former's viewers late last month. The deadline loomed heavy, as viewers were at risk of losing out on nearly a dozen of Disney's channels, including ABC and ESPN. At the time, YouTube TV claimed that Disney's proposition during the negotiations could force it to "raise prices" for consumers. Fingers were quickly pointed the opposite way, as Disney said YouTube TV was "exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers."</p><p>When both sides <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/disney-channels-disappear-from-youtube-tv-as-the-sides-fail-to-reach-deal">failed to reach an agreement</a>, those channels swiftly disappeared. Now, we're completely locked in a stalemate as neither side is willing to budge just yet on a way to return those channels to consumers. The finger-pointing continues; however, as YouTube TV claims Disney has been "unnecessarily aggressive and assertive.' Disney says the opposite, claiming that YouTube TV has blown the situation out of proportion.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are a handful of major updates that users can prepare to witness, starting with real-world landmarks when navigating their travels. The post states that, instead of just going off "turn left in 500 ft," or stop signs and traffic lights, Gemini brings forth more noticeable buildings, like gas stations.</p><p>With that, Google states Maps will inform you to "turn right" at the gas station up ahead or, perhaps, it'll name the nearest restaurant, so you're better informed on when to turn. This "landmark-based" navigation is rolling out to Android and iOS devices today (Nov 5).</p><p>To help you along in your navigation, Google Maps now leans on Gemini for proactive traffic alerts. If there are traffic jams, crashes, or anything that would impede any future travels, Maps will now send you a notification about it. Google states that these alerts can come through "even if you’re not actively navigating," so keep that in mind as these alerts roll out on Android and iOS today.</p><h2 id="gemini-arrives-for-navigation-2">Gemini arrives for navigation</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:484px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:123.97%;"><img id="KsdD8s5GwaQBMNnGacBM9V" name="google-maps-gemini-lens-update-coming-soon" alt="Gemini is headed for Google Maps with Lens in tow, helping users understand the establishments they visit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KsdD8s5GwaQBMNnGacBM9V.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="484" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:401px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:149.63%;"><img id="peHuQBkXdCM7wxMDULdr8V" name="google-maps-gemini-proactive-alerts-update" alt="Google Maps will soon deliver "proactive" updates about traffic jams, crashes, and more as a pop-up notification on Android and iOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/peHuQBkXdCM7wxMDULdr8V.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="401" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Gemini is, of course, a little more than a preemptive alert or navigational assistor, as the post highlights the inclusion of Lens and multi-step tasks. Regarding the former, Google Maps now has Lens built in with Gemini at its core. Users arriving at a restaurant can open Lens and ask about the establishment. When centered in the viewfinder, Google Maps' classic pin with the spots name will appear.</p><p>Users can voice their query or type it, and let Gemini explain "what's so popular" about the place they're at. Google teases that Gemini can also let you know if a local spot carries something particular you're looking for.</p><p>On the flip side, for multi-step tasks, Gemini can satisfy queries for something "budget-friendly" that also has "vegan options." Users can then lock in whatever destination Gemini and Google Maps produce, simplifying the navigation process to what feels like just a regular conversation. Moreover, Google says users can grant Gemini in Maps access to their Calendar.</p><p>If granted, the AI can throw in new events for you. Now, not all of this is available right away, as Google says Gemini's Lens capabilities in Maps will "roll out gradually later this month" for U.S. users in Android and iOS. Additionally, Gemini in navigation will soon hit Android and iOS devices "in the coming weeks," with an expected arrival on Android Auto in the future.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>Once upon a time, e-readers were mainly made by bookstore companies hoping you'd continue to peruse their shelves regularly, even if that's just in digital fashion. These days, brands like Onyx Boox and Bigme have made a name for themselves by making E Ink devices powered by Android, ensuring that you can do more on an e-reader than you ever thought possible.</p><p>This year, we've seen an explosion of color e-readers, as the E Ink Kaleido 3 has become more popular, and Bigme has been releasing new devices at a rapid pace since the spring. I find myself cycling between three of the company's best color e-readers depending on what I find myself reading, but it's unlikely that most people want two or three e-readers lying around the house.</p><p>So that begs the question: what kind of reader are you? Do you enjoy novels and fan fiction? Maybe you prefer graphic novels with a visual twist? How about binging manga series on a perfectly illuminated slab of e-paper? Or maybe you just want an e-ink tablet that's great for writing on, so you can publish your own stories someday. I've got three different-sized Bigme color e-readers here, and I'll help narrow down the best one for you.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

I'm certainly guilty of falling prey to the desire to live as minimally as possible at times, and fitting hundreds of books into a device that's only slightly larger than my phone is a very attractive idea.</p><p>That's where the Bigme B6 comes in. As the name implies, this one packs a 6-inch color E Ink Kaleido 3 display behind a slightly chunky frame. Aside from the size, the unique physical aspect here is the row of 5 capacitive keys at the bottom. I would prefer physical buttons over capacitive ones, but this is an interesting hook nonetheless.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xuJVCax6rFDR7rCfYpTihB" name="bigme-b6-navigation-bar" alt="The capacitive navigation buttons on the Bigme B6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xuJVCax6rFDR7rCfYpTihB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oKuNLJhMoZBsqUgn9UnehB" name="bigme-b1051c-b7-b6-01" alt="Comparing the sizes of the Bigme B1051C, B7, and B6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oKuNLJhMoZBsqUgn9UnehB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="XkHDWiQe5vabjj34vy6LbB" name="bigme-b1051c-b7-b6-02" alt="Comparing the sizes of the Bigme B1051C, B7, and B6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XkHDWiQe5vabjj34vy6LbB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If you don't like the default functions, you can assign each button to any of several dozen functions. This was the saving grace for me, as I didn't really care about most of the default button actions.</p><p>The only problem here is that function changes can be a little confusing at first, since these are printed capacitive keys. The AI key on mine, for instance, is set to open the E Ink center for adjusting display settings, and I always pause to think about what the button does before pressing it.</p><p>I'm a bit mixed on the design, too. I hate phones with flat sides and edges, and this feels no different from a plastic-clad iPhone 14-era phone, design-wise. Some people will enjoy that, but that's not me. I'd prefer more rounded edges. Thankfully, the included folio case makes this design feel a bit like opening a book since the sides of a book's pages are normally completely flat.</p><p>If a Boox Palma is a little too small and a standard Kindle is a bit too big, the Bigme B6 fits perfectly in between those sizes as a great little e-reader. It's also hard to argue with the price. At just $179, this is an Android-powered e-reader that's hard to resist!</p><h2 id="e-reading-and-note-taking-2">E-reading and note-taking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mRVKEHaCMbd6mm7REeudmG" name="bigme-b7-buttons" alt="The physical buttons on the Bigme B7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mRVKEHaCMbd6mm7REeudmG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just a step up in size is the Bigme B7, another color E Ink Kaleido 3-equipped e-reader with support for a stylus.

Despite having a generous 11-inch E Ink Kaleido 3 display, this one is an impressive 5mm thin and made of aluminum. It's by far the most premium-feeling product on this page, and that makes sense since it's geared toward productivity and serves as a laptop replacement.</p><p>My unit shipped with a keyboard folio case that includes a built-in trackpad, making the Android 14-powered experience feel similar to a laptop.

E Ink means that this display is great for a variety of tasks, from spreadsheet editing to email or report writing. Bigme even includes a whole productivity suite, so if you don't already have a favorite set of apps, you don't have to go searching the Play Store.</p><p>This one is also my go-to manga reader because of its generous screen size, excellent dual-tone front light, and highest effective resolution. All three of the Bigme e-readers on this page have a dual-tone backlight setup, but I find that the physical design of this one looks more natural than the other models.</p><p>That higher resolution screen also makes a big difference in the little details I enjoy in manga drawings. Additionally, I find that the backlight on the B1051C is the best, with the B6 just slightly behind, while the B7's cool backlight is a little too green for my liking. Check the comparisons in the gallery above to see what I mean!</p><h2 id="a-note-on-color-e-ink-2">A note on color E Ink</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-letters" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a few letters on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I previously wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/black-and-white-e-readers-arent-obsolete-yet">color E Ink isn't a great replacement for black-and-white E Ink</a> in some situations. Color E Ink isn't as clean or clear as black & white E Ink, and it's also dimmer. That means general readability is reduced, although I wouldn't call it "bad" by any means. It's just not the best option if you only read novels.</p><p>The example photo above uses Onyx Boox e-readers, but all 2025 color e-readers use the same E Ink Kaleido 3 technology, so the same effect applies across all of them. A larger reader, such as the Bigme B1051C, helps mitigate this issue due to its effective resolution, so keep that in mind if this effect bothers you.</p><p>This is the best that color E Ink gets at the moment, although it's possible that a fourth generation of color E Ink devices could provide some improvement in a year or two. Regardless of the differences between color and black & white E Ink, both technologies are far better for your eyes than an OLED or LCD, as they provide passively-lit options and are far more flicker-free than most other modern devices.

It's about the size of a standard paperback novel, but much lighter and thinner, making it more comfortable to read on. IT also includes a handy folio case that makes it look like a small book when the cover is closed.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is the benefit of an E Ink display over a traditional LCD or OLED tablet screen?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>E Ink displays are passively lit by ambient light, meaning they look very similar to paper. Since natural light can reflect onto the display and illuminate it, these screens are friendlier for long-term reading as they don't need to be artificially backlit to be seen. They're also flicker-free and extremely power efficient, as images stay permanently on the display until otherwise refreshed.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Can I run Android apps on these e-readers?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>All three Bigme e-readers on this page run Android 14 with full Google Play Store access, so you can add your Google account to them and use all of your favorite apps without hassle.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is the most important factor a potential buyer should consider when choosing between the three different screen sizes?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Each device's screen size fits its unique use-case best. The smallest of the three, the Bigme B6, is generally best for reading novels, digital books, and some light graphic novels. The Bigme B7 is a better choice for a portable graphic novel reader and excellent for note-takers, as it includes a stylus in the box. The Bigme B1051C Pro is the largest of the three and is best for manga reading and productivity, as its higher-resolution display better shows details in art and allows for more space in productivity apps.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

That should translate to around two days or more of battery life, depending on usage. OnePlus claims the phone supports 15 hours of video playback on a single charge.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-oneplus-15-s-battery-life-2">Everything you need to know about the OnePlus 15's battery life</h2><p>OnePlus's latest flagship is already available in China and is set for a global launch. When it arrives, it'll come with a few downgrades compared to the OnePlus 13, but not in battery life. OnePlus equipped its newest smartphone with a dual-cell silicon-carbon battery, cramming 7,300mAh of capacity into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-photo-samples">OnePlus 15</a>.</p><p>That's a significant increase over the 6,000mAh capacity of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/one-year-with-the-oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, which also used a dual-cell silicon-carbon battery, albeit a smaller one. Compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries, silicon-carbon battery cells are more energy-dense, allowing brands like OnePlus to put high-capacity cells into smartphones. The OnePlus 15's battery is 21% larger than the OnePlus 13's, which is significant since the latter already had a reputation for excellent battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RNDHdNYB8t85myGHxp9mhX" name="OnePlus15-SandStorm- edition" alt="OnePlus 15 Sans storm editions isn't all just the looks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNDHdNYB8t85myGHxp9mhX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In practice, OnePlus claims that the OnePlus 15 can last up to 19 hours during continuous video playback. While playing intensive games at 165 FPS, the company says the phone will still last an outstanding 6.6 hours on a single charge. The OnePlus 15 can also be used for navigation for 12 hours straight. Please note that these figures are based on OnePlus' internal lab testing, and the actual battery life of the OnePlus 15 may vary.</p><p>Charging speeds are downright stunning on the OnePlus 15, too. The brand claims a five-minute quick charge translates to six hours of video playback, which is a staggering number. A 30-minute charge will bring your OnePlus 15's battery capacity to over the halfway mark. Not only will it last long, but it will also be quick to recharge.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-charging-speed">OnePlus 15 charges at speeds of up to 120W</a> in China, although charging speeds are typically slower for the U.S. model. The phone also supports 50W wireless, 10W reverse wireless, and 5W reverse wired charging. A full charge is reportedly achieved in just 40 minutes, another impressive specification for the OnePlus 15.</p><p>All these signs indicate that the OnePlus 15 is capable of achieving multi-day battery life, likely lasting two days on a single charge, although we'll have to confirm this with our own testing. For reference, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review#section-oneplus-13-battery-life-charging-and-performance">our OnePlus 13 review stated</a> that "excellent overall battery life means you'll never have battery anxiety." The OnePlus 15 has the capacity and fast-charging tech to perform even better than that five-star Android phone.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 will surely be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones of 2025</a>, and the battery is a major reason why.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="72b255f4-dfa2-4fe9-a6e4-2c7403b1d0e5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Battery champion</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15 packs one of the biggest batteries we've ever seen in a flagship phone, with a 7,300mAh capacity that dwarfs the competition.
