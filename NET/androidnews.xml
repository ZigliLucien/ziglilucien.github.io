It pulls in data from various Google apps on your phone and surfaces relevant information exactly when you need it.</p><p>For example, if you've details about an upcoming flight saved in Gmail and you are texting someone about that trip, Magic Cue can surface the relevant flight info right then and there without you having to search for it manually.</p><p>Now, according to a leak shared by Telegram user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/KieronQuinn">Kieron Quinn</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-wallet-tasks-integration-apk-teardown-3633483/">Android Authority</a>), Google is working on making Magic Cue even more useful. The leak suggests that Magic Cue will soon gain access to data from additional Google apps, including Google Wallet and Google Tasks.</p><h2 id="google-is-quietly-expanding-what-magic-cue-can-do-2">Google is quietly expanding what Magic Cue can do</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CFCjbXjn9E3FTifUjxAGvX" name="magic-cue-new-leak-jan-2026" alt="New integrations for Wallet and Tasks in Magic Cue" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CFCjbXjn9E3FTifUjxAGvX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Kieron Quinn on Telegram (Via Android Authority))</span></figcaption></figure><p>Toggles for these new integrations reportedly showed up for the user in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/more-android-phones-could-feel-the-magic-cue-as-this-leak-spots-early-signs">Magic Cue</a> settings on a Pixel 10 device. With Wallet and Tasks support, Magic Cue could surface things like boarding passes, tickets, and payment cards from Wallet, along with reminders and to-dos from Google Tasks whenever they are contextually relevant.</p><p>These new apps would join an already growing list of Magic Cue integrations. At the moment, Magic Cue can pull data from apps such as Pixel Screenshots, Gmail, Messages, Keep, Contacts, and Calendar, and adding Wallet and Tasks should make it even more powerful.</p><p>Google has not officially announced the new integrations yet, and the feature doesn't appear to be live at the moment. That said, the fact that it is already showing up in the settings on a Pixel 10 device suggests it could start rolling out sooner rather than later. We'll keep you updated once Google makes it official.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This lets Gemini reference your data to deliver responses that are more personalized. Alongside that update, Google now appears to be rolling out another quality-of-life improvement aimed at speeding things up when you want a quicker response.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2026/01/18/gemini-answer-now/">9to5Google</a>, Google is introducing a new "Answer now" button in Gemini. When you use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ive-tested-gemini-3-and-it-proves-google-has-what-it-takes-to-win-the-ai-race">Gemini 3 Pro</a> or Gemini 3 Thinking models and ask a question, you will now see an "Answer now" button appear next to the spinning status indicator while Gemini is generating a response.</p><h2 id="google-adds-a-faster-way-to-get-gemini-answers-2">Google adds a faster way to get Gemini answers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.09%;"><img id="SARTmXK66SCcs4tEBbgdK7" name="gemini-answer-now-button" alt="Answer now button in Gemini app for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SARTmXK66SCcs4tEBbgdK7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3280" height="2430" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tapping this button skips the in-depth thinking process and delivers a faster answer, exactly as the name suggests. The button does not appear when you are using the Gemini 3 Fast model, since that model already prioritizes speed by default.</p><p>A similar feature existed in the Gemini app before, but it worked slightly differently. Previously, a "Skip" button would appear and automatically switch the model to Gemini Fast, regardless of what you had selected.</p><p>This time, Google has changed the behavior so that Gemini continues using the currently selected model, either Pro or Thinking, and simply returns an answer faster. You can confirm this by checking the model used via the three-dot overflow menu.</p><p>Google appears to be rolling out this change broadly to both free and paid users across the web, Android, and iOS. That said, the iOS app still shows the old "Skip" button instead of "Answer now," even though the underlying behavior now matches the updated implementation.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Lenovo unveiled the new Motorola Razr Fold during its press conference, making it the first book-style foldable from the company. Up until now, the Razr line had only been flip phones, but it finally got its first true book-style foldable.</p><p>Although it won't be launching until later this year, we did get a chance to use the phone for a bit at CES, and our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">first impression of the Razr Fold</a> is largely positive. This also means existing players now pose a big threat to Motorola's entry in this space, one of them being the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Armed with an impressive design and some of the best software you'll find on any Android phone, can the Razr Fold be competitive enough to take it on? While we wait for Motorola to reveal the Razr Fold's complete specs, here's how it compares based on our hands-on experience.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-fold-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-design-and-display-2">Motorola Razr Fold vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d4ppUHHHtVcZzqHAVEnUgH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d4ppUHHHtVcZzqHAVEnUgH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't have any official numbers yet, but Android Central senior editor, Harish Jonnalagadda, has confidently stated during his hands-on with the device that the Razr Fold is every bit as slim and light as its competitors from Samsung and Vivo. This means the Fold's thickness should be roughly 4.2-4.5mm when unfolded and around 9mm when folded. We'd estimate the weight to be around 200 grams.</p><p>For a first attempt, Motorola seems to have done a fine job with the build quality as well. My guess is it should have some degree of IP protection, but we don't know the exact certification yet.</p><p>The two colors of the Motorola Razr Fold have their own distinct finishes. The Pantone Lily White has a silky finish, while the Blackend Blue variant has a diamond piqué-inspired finish. The rear camera bulge is quite pronounced, too, which is evident when you view the phone from the top.</p><p>The displays look pretty solid from the little time we had with the phone. There's a 6.6-inch outer screen and an 8.1-inch folding screen with a 2K resolution. Once again, we don't have the full specs, but both are AMOLED, and you should expect high brightness numbers, robust scratch protection, and probably higher than 120Hz refresh rates. The Motorola Razr Fold also supports an S Pen-like stylus, which can be purchased separately.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gGiHtxSwFKFQMnbitUu9z" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gGiHtxSwFKFQMnbitUu9z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Unfortunately, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should be thicker than the Razr Fold, measuring 5.2mm when unfolded and 10.8mm when folded. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is also likely heavier at 258 grams. In terms of ergonomics and carrying comfort, the Razr Fold should easily win.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold has a slightly smaller 6.4-inch cover screen but a high peak brightness of around 3,000 nits. There's an 8-inch folding display with the same peak brightness level. Both displays perform very well in outdoor sunlight, and we had no issues with legibility during testing.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first foldable phone to feature an IP68 water- and dust-resistant rating. Like the Razr Fold, the Pixel also comes in just two shades with similar finishes.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-fold-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hardware-and-specs-2">Motorola Razr Fold vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="meN8TCuFJD5PTgg6TegqAH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/meN8TCuFJD5PTgg6TegqAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't have the pricing for the Motorola Razr Fold just yet, but rumor has it it should come in around $1,500. RAM and storage are still unknown, but our in-house Motorola expert, Derrek Lee, believes that the phone will arrive in a single variant with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage, with the possibility of a 1TB storage option. This should make it slightly cheaper than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which costs roughly $1,619 for the same storage. The Pixel also has 256GB and 1TB storage options.</p><p>The main chipset in the Motorola Razr Fold remains a mystery, but it would be foolish if Motorola hadn't used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>. This is Qualcomm's flagship SoC for 2026, and we'll see it in nearly every flagship Android going forward. The Pixel uses Google's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a> chip, which has improved over the G4 but is still nowhere near the performance of the Snapdragon.</p><p>If you'll be doing heavy multitasking, gaming, or using resource-intensive apps, my bet would be on the Razr Fold to do a much better job.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Fold</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16, Seven years of OS upgrades</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folding display</p></td><td  ><p>8.1-inch, 120Hz LTPO OLED (1-120Hz)</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Super Actua Flex display, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED (1-120Hz), 2076 x 2152, HDR, 3,000 nits, Ultra Thin Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Outer display</p></td><td  ><p>6.56-inch, 120Hz OLED</p></td><td  ><p>6.4-inch Actua display, 120Hz OLED (60-120Hz), 1080 x 2424, HDR, 3,000 nits, Gorilla Glass Victus 2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5  (unconfirmed)</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB (unconfirmed)</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>512GB  (unconfirmed)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/ 512GB/1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Sony LYTIA main + 50MP 3x telephoto + 50MP ultrawide (w/ AF)</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto + 10.5MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover + folding screen cameras</p></td><td  ><p>32MP + 20MP</p></td><td  ><p>10MP + 10MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G, Bluetooth 6.0  (unconfirmed)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, AptX HD, USB-C 3.2, eSIM only, Satellite SOS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint scanner, face unlock  (unconfirmed)</p></td><td  ><p>Side-mounted fingerprint scanner, face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>5,015mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (folded/ unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>76.3 x 155.2 x 10.8 mm / 155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>258g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Pantone Blackened Blue, Pantone Lily White</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone, Jade</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Motorola is keeping mum about the battery details for now, but considering it feels as slim as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, it probably has a smaller battery than the 5,015mAh capacity in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Size alone doesn't always determine real-world battery life, so the Razr Fold could very well have comparable runtimes if Motorola has optimized the software well.</p><p>Charging speed should be well above the 30W that the Pixel has. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra</a> flip phone has 68W charging, so the Razr Fold should have the same, if not higher. Wireless charging should be 30W on the Razr Fold, but whether this will be Qi2 compatible or not remains to be seen. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold has built-in magnets for Qi2 charging, which it calls PixelSnap.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-fold-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-cameras-2">Motorola Razr Fold vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w24uvYjbe6fgWRrAZCemcc" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-jade-pixelsnap-ring-02" alt="A Pixelsnap Ring on the back of a folded Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w24uvYjbe6fgWRrAZCemcc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's weird, but you'd think Google's most expensive phone would have the best cameras, but that's not the case. Sadly, Google refuses to use the same sensors from the Pro/Pro XL models on the Fold, and as a result, it misses out on some great features like ProRes Zoom. The actual quality of the images is pretty good, though, and it's hard to complain. The front cameras on the outer and inner screens aren't particularly great as they are just 10MP sensors.</p><p>Motorola, on the other hand, has gone all out, equipping the Razr Fold with an impressive spec sheet. Yes, this spec isn't under wraps. You get three 50MP sensors on the back, two of which are from the Sony LYTIA series, which have proven to be very good in the past. There's even a 3x telephoto lens on the back, which should give you good zoom shots, but probably not as good as the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's 5x optical zoom.</p><p>The front cameras on the Razr Fold are quite impressive too, as you get a 32MP sensor on the outside screen and a 20MP sensor in the folding display. The Razr Fold has a good shot of outshining the Pixel 10 Pro Fold when it comes to imaging, but we'll know for sure once we've tested both side by side.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-fold-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-software-2">Motorola Razr Fold vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wuTzro4hTKviGMzA3unJ2J" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wuTzro4hTKviGMzA3unJ2J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> and gets seven years of software updates, which include OS upgrades and security patches. Motorola hasn't released any info about software update commitment yet, but I do hope it's more than two or three years.</p><p>The Razr Fold is expected to come with the usual Moto UX apps and customizations, along with "flexible layouts" for this new form factor, according to its press materials. Motorola's product page for the Razr Fold shows one use case where the phone is horizontally placed on a table, half open, and a person typing out a to-do list on a split-screen keyboard.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold's software experience is highly polished, predictable, and reliable. Plus, Google keeps adding new features every quarter with Pixel Drop updates. There are also plenty of AI features to keep you occupied. Google still lags behind in terms of multitasking, though, as you're still limited to using just two apps on the folding screen at a time.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-fold-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-which-one-should-you-buy-2">Motorola Razr Fold vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Which one should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xtMsZxsLqbUPMkMfCRY2uH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xtMsZxsLqbUPMkMfCRY2uH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to give a verdict just yet when we know so little about the Motorola Razr Fold's full specs. What we do know, though, is that it's really slim and light, the camera specs look very promising, and the pricing should be very aggressive from the get-go. These three factors alone might be worth waiting till summer before making your decision. This is also roughly when Samsung would be expected to reveal the new Galaxy Fold, which is yet another competitor to watch out for, although it should definitely be a lot more expensive than the Razr Fold.</p><p>One thing going in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's favor right now is Google's insanely long commitment to software updates. Plus, the IP68 rating ensures your phone will survive a dunk in the pool. Motorola has not revealed details about the Razr Fold's capabilities in these two areas, but I can hazard a guess at least that the software update commitment won't be this lengthy.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Redmi Note 15 might be the clearest example yet of how Xiaomi is trying to fix its once-iconic mid-range lineup, but doing so at a frustratingly slow pace. I've been using the Redmi Note 15 for more than a week now, and there are so many moments when it feels like Xiaomi is listening again. But then there are moments when it reminds you why the Redmi Note name has lost some of its shine over the past few years.</p><p>Xiaomi's Redmi Note series was once an easy recommendation in the mid-range smartphone space, but that reputation began to slip a few generations ago, particularly around the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/redmi-note-11-pro-5g-review#section-redmi-note-11-pro-5g-should-you-buy-it">Redmi Note 11 Pro</a>, which our Senior Editor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/harish-jonnalagadda">Harish Jonnalagadda</a> described as a "poor showing for the category." Since then, Xiaomi has struggled to consistently deliver the kind of value that made the series iconic in the first place.</p><p>The Redmi Note 15 does not completely undo that damage, but it does suggest that Xiaomi is slowly finding its footing again. You get a display that stands out for the price, a large battery, a slim design that makes the phone comfortable to use day-to-day, and several extras that make it a compelling option in its bracket.</p><p>At the same time, familiar issues remain. The software already feels slow and dated, and the camera does a little to stand out in an increasingly crowded mid-range segment.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-note-15-price-and-availability"><span>Redmi Note 15: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fPfpKri3XvhX5wyXNBKR86" name="redmi-note-15-review-5" alt="Hands-on with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 15 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPfpKri3XvhX5wyXNBKR86.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi introduced the Redmi Note 15 first in its home market of China in August 2025, then rolled it out to global markets on December 18, 2025, followed by a launch in India on January 6, 2026.</p><p>The Redmi Note 15 is available in both 4G and 5G variants, which is somewhat unusual for a smartphone in 2026 since most brands have shifted entirely to 5G. That said, the Redmi Note 15 5G comes in 128GB and 256GB storage options. While Xiaomi has introduced 6GB RAM variants in some global markets, both the 128GB and 256GB models sold in India ship with 8GB of RAM.</p><p>The Redmi Note 15 starts at INR 22,999/€279, while the 8GB/256GB variant is priced at INR 24,999/€299. All models also include a microSD card slot shared with the SIM tray, allowing storage expansion of up to 1TB.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Xiaomi Redmi Note 15 5G</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>HyperOS 2 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.77-inch, AMOLED, 3200 nits peak brightness (800 nits in high brightness mode), 120Hz, 2392 × 1080 pixels, 3840Hz PWM dimming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, Adreno 710, 4nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB / 256GB</p><p>Expandable up to 1TB via microSD card</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>108MP, f/1.7 (primary) + 8MP, f/2.2 (ultra-wide)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>20MP, f/2.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP65 + IP66 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1, NFC, IR blaster</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Under-display fingerprint sensor, Face unlock, PIN, Pattern, Password</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,520 mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W USB-C fast wired charging</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>164 X 75.42 X 7.35 mm</p><p>Weight: 178g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Black, Glacier Blue, Mist Purple</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-note-15-what-i-like"><span>Redmi Note 15: What I like</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RNqahtFhP2EEXsoTywU496" name="redmi-note-15-review-6" alt="Hands-on with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 15 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNqahtFhP2EEXsoTywU496.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While brands like Samsung appear to have stepped away from slim smartphones with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">rumored cancellation of the Galaxy S26 Edge</a>, other Android brands are still willing to experiment with the form factor. And that becomes immediately obvious the moment you take the Redmi Note 15 out of the box.</p><p>At 7.35mm, the Redmi Note 15 isn't as thin as other "slim" smartphones, but it is noticeably slimmer than traditional flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-15r">OnePlus 15</a>, both of which measure over 8mm.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="srAyaTJNMev9d82yaqDxc5" name="redmi-note-15-review-10" alt="Hands-on with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 15 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/srAyaTJNMev9d82yaqDxc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Redmi Note 15 manages this while staying light at just 178g and still packing a sizeable battery. Much of this is made possible by Xiaomi adopting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/electric-car-battery-tech-will-supercharge-your-next-smartphone">silicon-carbon battery technology</a>, while some other brands are still taking their time to implement it.</p><p>That low weight largely comes from the phone's plastic build, which can feel a bit cheap at times. That said, given the pricing, I find it's a reasonable compromise.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9XycRhRS6fBtTn9yNzjHn5" name="redmi-note-15-review-9" alt="Hands-on with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 15 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9XycRhRS6fBtTn9yNzjHn5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Design-wise, the Redmi Note 15 looks like a fairly standard budget Xiaomi device, with rounded edges and curved glass, something that is becoming less common on smartphones today. The rear features a squarish camera module that misleadingly appears to house three sensors, but actually includes just two cameras.</p><p>What doesn't feel cheap, however, is the display up front. The Redmi Note 15 ships with a large 6.67-inch AMOLED panel that is easily one of the best I have seen in this segment. It supports a 120Hz refresh rate and reaches up to 3,200 nits of peak brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ggAdRViom4yUJj8N7u7mj5" name="redmi-note-15-review-13" alt="Hands-on with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 15 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ggAdRViom4yUJj8N7u7mj5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While many smartphones in this price range still have thick bezels, Xiaomi has done a solid job keeping them to a minimum. The AMOLED panel delivers vibrant colors, good viewing angles, and a consistently pleasant experience in daily use. The under-display fingerprint sensor is also reliable and works well.</p><p>There were plenty of things that impressed me about the Redmi Note 15, but the most <em>Note</em>-worthy is its battery. For a phone this thin and light, it packs a sizeable 5,520 mAh battery and supports up to 45W fast charging. While it cannot match devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-15r">OnePlus 15R</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-took-the-find-x9-pro-to-mexico-its-cameras-are-on-another-level-entirely">Oppo Find X9 Pro</a>, which come with much larger batteries, I had no trouble getting through a full day on a single charge, even on 5G.</p><p>There is also support for 18W wireless charging, which is rare in this segment, and Xiaomi still includes a charger in the box, something other brands could learn from.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b4n4LZTJyd2paYug62jtu5" name="redmi-note-15-review-8" alt="Hands-on with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 15 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4n4LZTJyd2paYug62jtu5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The primary camera is quite impressive. It is the first smartphone to use Samsung's ISOCELL HM9 sensor, which was developed in collaboration with Xiaomi. The result is strong performance in good lighting, with the camera delivering consistently solid shots in broad daylight.</p><p>Photos look sharp and detailed, with colors that lean slightly bright without feeling unnatural. The 108MP sensor also enables up to 3x lossless zoom via sensor cropping, helping compensate for the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera. Low-light performance does take a hit, with the processor pushing noise reduction a bit too far to recover lost detail, but that is fairly typical behavior for large sensors in this segment.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

At a time when most phones have dropped microSD support, and brands usually push users toward purchasing cloud storage, the Redmi Note 15 still includes a dedicated SD card slot. It is shared with the secondary SIM slot, but it allows storage expansion of up to 1TB.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-note-15-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Redmi Note 15: What I don't like</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yKLPQ3E78xpRfVRUmn8Du5" name="redmi-note-15-review-12" alt="Hands-on with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 15 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yKLPQ3E78xpRfVRUmn8Du5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After using the Redmi Note 15 for the past week, the biggest issue for me, and arguably the most important part of a smartphone, is the processor. The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, which is neither the latest nor the most capable chipset, and that clearly shows in day-to-day performance.</p><p>This is by no means a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming smartphone</a>, and some sluggishness is expected at this price point. However, the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 struggles even with basic daily tasks. There are frequent hiccups when switching between apps or even returning to the home screen after applying a wallpaper, which makes the experience feel unnecessarily slow.</p><p>Part of this sluggishness also stems from the software. We are in 2026, yet the Redmi Note 15 ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, running Xiaomi's HyperOS 2 skin. Xiaomi says Android 16-based HyperOS 3 is coming soon, but launching a new phone with software that is already over a year old feels unacceptable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FQFbFXgfhfpxriYfXWx6j5" name="redmi-note-15-review-14" alt="Hands-on with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 15 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FQFbFXgfhfpxriYfXWx6j5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And even though Xiaomi is promising four years of OS updates for the Redmi Note 15, starting a year behind effectively means users will realistically get only three meaningful Android updates.</p><p>The software itself is heavily customized across almost every interface element. This adds extra strain to an already-average processor and further contributes to performance issues. On top of that, there is still a noticeable amount of pre-installed bloatware out of the box, giving the chipset even more to deal with from day one.</p><p>It would help significantly if Xiaomi toned down some of its software features on lower-end devices, but the company continues to miss the mark. Running Geekbench 6 on the Redmi Note 15 only reinforced this, with the phone turning out to be one of the slowest devices in its price range. Spending as little as INR 3,000 (about $30) more can get you noticeably better-performing alternatives.</p><div ><table><caption>Geekbench 6 benchmark results</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Smartphone</p></th><th  ><p>Price</p></th><th  ><p>Single-core</p></th><th  ><p>Multi-core</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Redmi Note 15</p></td><td  ><p>INR 22,999 / $255</p></td><td  ><p>1,014</p></td><td  ><p>2,894</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Nothing Phone 3a</p></td><td  ><p>INR 24,999 / $275</p></td><td  ><p>1,208</p></td><td  ><p>3,325</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OnePlus Nord CE5</p></td><td  ><p>INR 24,999 / $275</p></td><td  ><p>1,309</p></td><td  ><p>3,884</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>There are also a few smaller issues worth mentioning, such as the ultrawide camera, which is underwhelming and feels more like a checkbox feature than something genuinely useful.

COROS greatly improved the color and contrast ratio compared to older models, making it fully readable indoors while looking fantastic outdoors. It actually beats the pricier APEX 4 for visibility; the latter's sapphire glass layer adds a reflective tint that dims the contrast.</p><p>I'll admit to preferring AMOLED displays in general; anyone with poorer eyesight might benefit from an Instinct 3 AMOLED, which hits a similar three-week lifespan to the NOMAD. But MIP displays are always-on by default, while AOD wrecks the Instinct's battery life. And the latter looks much dimmer in direct sunlight, since it only hits 1,000 nits. For quick glances while running on rough trails, I'd trust the NOMAD more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="c6K45y7UcyB6HYFBTLRQYn" name="COROS-APEX-4-vs-NOMAD-displays" alt="Photo of the COROS NOMAD (left) and APEX 4 (right) both sitting on a flat surface.

Download your local region, and you can check which trail to take on impromptu hikes, with near-immediate map loading when you zoom in/out or swipe to pan.</p><p>Creating a route in the COROS app is simple, auto-following trails to specific waypoints, and it syncs to the NOMAD in seconds. With that, you have clear turn-by-turn navigation for your hike — with warnings if you go off trail.</p><p>Assuming you pay twice as much for a Garmin watch with maps, you'll get perks like NextFork warnings at trailheads, ClimbPro data on upcoming hills, or text lists of nearby or up-ahead POIs that you can navigate directly to. But the bloated experience overloads Garmin's processor, so it's laggy and frustrating to use outside of courses.

I haven't replicated the error on subsequent hikes, thankfully.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kZgLf6twkLr49HVeP3pVMM" name="Coros-Nomad-hiking-GPS-test-1" alt="A satellite map showing how the GPS lines for the COROS NOMAD (orange) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (red) compare during a hike." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZgLf6twkLr49HVeP3pVMM.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jbMQe985P7Fz2N7j5MyPLM" name="Coros-Nomad-hiking-GPS-test-5" alt="A satellite map showing how the GPS lines for the COROS NOMAD (orange) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (red) compare during a hike." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jbMQe985P7Fz2N7j5MyPLM.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fXr5FZpzcqhsiYhBEP9xZM" name="Coros-Nomad-hiking-GPS-test-4" alt="A satellite map showing how the GPS lines for the COROS NOMAD (orange) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (red) compare during a hike." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fXr5FZpzcqhsiYhBEP9xZM.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9hudpefWbkqDxjT3BxmbGM" name="Coros-Nomad-hiking-GPS-test-3" alt="A satellite map showing how the GPS lines for the COROS NOMAD (orange) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (red) compare during a hike." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9hudpefWbkqDxjT3BxmbGM.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gYyo6xkWsVtqTb7c3nFFXM" name="Coros-Nomad-hiking-GPS-test-2" alt="A satellite map showing how the GPS lines for the COROS NOMAD (orange) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (red) compare during a hike." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gYyo6xkWsVtqTb7c3nFFXM.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I used the NOMAD for two other activities, a 10K jog and a seven-mile hike, both using its dual-frequency mode.

Still, potential Garmin converts will miss the built-in flashlight, contactless payments, official MIL-STD-810H rating, and apps like Spotify and YouTube Music.</p><p>My complaints are more about software than hardware. COROS made this for hikers, but most of its training software remains tailored to road running more than trail running, hiking, or rucking. VO2 Max isn't tracked for trail runs, you can't add pack weight to adjust your estimates, and recovery estimates take cardiovascular tiredness into account more than muscle fatigue or altitude adjustment. Basically, the NOMAD could cater to hikers <em>more</em> than it does now.</p><p>Anyone used to an Apple or Wear OS watch will find COROS's UI painfully rudimentary. I don't mind a streamlined fitness experience, but I do find using the toolbox annoying, as well as the notification submenu.

But it only offers breadcrumb navigation, with no offline maps to make confusing trailheads easier to navigate, and it costs $400–500.</p><p>Most other competing adventure watches are too expensive to be called "competition."

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>E-readers have grown leaps and bounds as a category over the last year, thanks to a ton of new players entering the market and significant advancements in E Ink technology. You may not have heard of DuRoBo before, but this new company's first device, Krono, is doing something unique that attempts to set it apart from the pack.</p><p>DuRoBo's first e-reader attaches a digital crown to the side and adds quick recording features for note-takers, plus it runs Android 15 in a light frame that's comfortable to hold for a long time. Plus, it packs nice haptics into a device that usually goes without such niceties, adding tactility to its digital facade.</p><p>I've been using the Krono since early December, and while most of that time was spent on a pre-launch firmware, I received the v1.0 update right around when CES kicked off. DuRoBo sells it for $279.99/ €279.99 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.durobo.com/">on its website</a>.</p><h2 id="a-solid-start-2">A solid start</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xUATh7NvgKumNUUiotmjwY" name="durobo-krono-screen-books-01" alt="Reading Percy Jackson via the Google Play Books app on a DuRoBo Krono" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xUATh7NvgKumNUUiotmjwY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you compare the DuRoBo Krono to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-e-ink-android-phone-is-the-kindle-phone-ive-always-wanted">Bigme's E Ink phones</a> or dedicated phone-sized e-readers like the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Onyx Boox Palma</a>, it's clear they all share similar DNA (and probably some similar parts). Most of them use E Ink Carta displays — this one packs a black-and-white Carta 1200 HD with 300 PPI-equivalent resolution — ensuring that regular tasks don't feel sluggish like an old Kindle. You can quickly adjust the quality or speed via presets found in the Control Center.</p><p>They've also all got similarly chunky bezels, which, on a device this size, get in the way more often than they help, unlike a tablet. But the Krono is designed more for simplicity than to replace your phone most of the time, and it features a thoughtful scroll wheel on the side for lazy scrolling days.</p><p>One of the nicest things about reading digital books is that it's more effortless to hold a digital reader than to fold back stacks of pages of a physical novel. Plus, the construction is not only nicely textured matte plastic, but it also weighs just 168g, making it lighter than some other comparably sized e-readers. I wish it weren't so wide, but this is a common issue among e-readers of this size.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EVK7jgvqegoCe3LbTFem6h" name="durobo-krono-bigme-hibreak-pro-onyx-boox-palma-front" alt="Comparing the front and default launchers of the Bigme HiBreak Pro (left), DuRoBo Krono (center), and Onyx Boox Palma (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EVK7jgvqegoCe3LbTFem6h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Comparing the front and default launchers of the Bigme HiBreak Pro (left), DuRoBo Krono (center), and Onyx Boox Palma (right) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But while this wheel works brilliantly in some apps — web browsing and reading vertically-scrolling books like the Bible app are two examples — the wheel isn't customizable and doesn't work for horizontally-scrolling apps. That means the Kindle app, Google Play Books app, and anything else that scrolls horizontally won't do anything when you turn the wheel.</p><p>That's annoying enough on its own, but it's made even worse by the fact that turning the wheel delivers such a nice haptic tactility that it just begs to be scrolled all the time. That's not to say the wheel is perfect, as it feels rougher to turn when using a single finger versus pinching and turning as you might a typical dial, but I still would like to be able to use it <em>all</em> the time.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fprv2pniV9yUcou4nqN7X5" name="durobo-krono-power-volume-buttons" alt="The power and volume buttons on the right of the DuRoBo Krono" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fprv2pniV9yUcou4nqN7X5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="F252UuXAu7wLeLwcT8csW5" name="durobo-krono-scroll-wheel-01" alt="The scroll wheel on the left side of the DuRoBo Krono" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F252UuXAu7wLeLwcT8csW5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CHYW3NTHu496RJEghFqAW5" name="durobo-krono-scroll-wheel-02" alt="The scroll wheel on the left side of the DuRoBo Krono" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHYW3NTHu496RJEghFqAW5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ho4Jwc7f327zimJBq3T2b5" name="durobo-krono-google-play-store" alt="The Google Play Store on the DuRoBo Krono" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ho4Jwc7f327zimJBq3T2b5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>DuRuBo's default launcher is purposefully minimalistic, featuring letters for app icons instead of whatever visual design you might be used to. This makes you more thoughtfully pick out what you're launching rather than be driven by design or colors, the way an OLED-equipped smartphone might. But the launcher is also very basic and lacks customization options.</p><p>Since this runs Android, though, you can swap it out with anything you want to use — I personally prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&hl=en_US">Niagara Launcher</a>. But you can't swap out the built-in Spark or Libby AI functions, both of which are quickly activated by clicking in the scroll wheel on the side.</p><p>It's not that these functions are inherently bad, but Spark is rather simple (and the AI summary feature for voice notes is infuriatingly slow), and I don't feel like I need to add yet another AI assistant to my daily routine.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wGnJejDv36tDxkgo6xmMcF" name="durobo-krono-screen-lock-calendar" alt="The DuRoBo Krono's calendar lockscreen in the sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGnJejDv36tDxkgo6xmMcF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6huNRFLQ2nP3YSoMUxLYZF" name="durobo-krono-spark-notes-app" alt="The DuRoBo Krono's Spark notes app transcribing a voice note" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6huNRFLQ2nP3YSoMUxLYZF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QqnutUZSKCJBbFieySNodF" name="durobo-krono-control-center" alt="The DuRoBo Krono's Control Center" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QqnutUZSKCJBbFieySNodF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Because of this, I feel like the DuRoBo Krono is best recommended as a minimalist phone-sized e-reader.

Some way to change scrolling from vertical to horizontal on a per-app basis will be a huge step toward making it more useful.</p><p>DuRoBo has just delivered the 1.0 firmware update, so I'm sure lots of new things are cooking for the Krono in the future.

After testing last year's Moto G Power 2025, I had fairly tepid expectations for the Moto G Power 2026, and rightfully so; the latest model is merely a minor spec bump over its predecessor, and in some ways, a downgrade.</p><p>There are some benefits to getting the newer model, from having the latest OS to the slight increase in battery capacity. However, after a few weeks with the Moto G Power 2026, it hasn't quite convinced me that it should exist, and Motorola may have been better off skipping a year, as it did with the Moto G Play in 2025.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4123px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="7LJyLQp2w7CbVvNrz3osUf" name="Moto-G-Power-2026-vs-Power-2025-1" alt="Moto G Power 2026 and Power 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LJyLQp2w7CbVvNrz3osUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4123" height="2318" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Moto G Power 2026 (left) and 2025 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Opening the box, you would be forgiven for mistaking this for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>. The phones are virtually identical in design; even the dimensions are the same, down to the millimeter. That said, there are subtle differences in the camera housing: The Moto G Power 2025 was more of a closed rectangular shape, whereas the 2026 model has a more open shape that fans out toward the device's frame.</p><p>It took me a while to notice because these two phones are <em>so </em>similar. However, what I noticed almost immediately is how the phone <em>feels</em>. Motorola's campaign against glass pack panels continues into 2026, and the Moto G Power 2026 has the most fabric-like texture I've seen or felt on a Motorola phone, save for the Alcantara <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>.</p><p>The way the texture is implemented on the back makes it look and feel like fabric until you get a closer look, and even then, it can still be hard to tell. But despite its synthetic nature, it makes the Moto G Power 2026 feel quite grippy and a tad more premium than even its predecessor.</p><p>It also means you'll never have to worry about fingerprints smudging the device. It also helps with durability; there's no glass on the back to worry about breaking, and the impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">MIL-STD-810H spec</a> and IP68/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> water- and dust-resistance rating mean I don't have to worry about the inclement Seattle weather ruining the phone. The tougher Gorilla Glass 7i should also prove more durable than its predecessor, but I fortunately haven't had to put that to the test.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4031px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vMxxRxNg2ruCe56E6gCoGf" name="Moto-G-Power-2026-review-2" alt="Moto G Power 2026 back panel and cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vMxxRxNg2ruCe56E6gCoGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4031" height="2267" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, much of the design sort of goes against that premium feel. The frame matches the color nicely, but the phone is rather thick and slightly boxy due to its flat sides. It's the same 8.7mm thickness as the 2025 model, but at a time when phones are slimming down, it does feel a bit unwieldy, even for a midrange device.</p><p>Then, moving to the front, the rather large and uneven bezels also remind you that this is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>. Fortunately, the display itself isn't too bad. It's only a 120Hz LCD panel, but in my use, I found the colors surprisingly vibrant, and the brightness feels fairly adequate, even at just 1,000 nits. My only issue is that the auto brightness sometimes feels too aggressive or not aggressive enough, prompting me to manually adjust it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3927px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="xCzob3hayqBe2mHTFK6oUe" name="Moto-G-Power-2026-review-4" alt="Moto G Power 2026 display in front of a bookshelf" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xCzob3hayqBe2mHTFK6oUe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3927" height="2208" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the design, the Moto G Power 2026 also borrows its predecessor's processor.

I'm able to play Honkai: Star Rail at high settings and 30fps, but anything beyond that will noticeably push the phone, with the frame rate dropping to 10-20fps even in 60fps mode. To get smoother gameplay, you'll want to play in medium graphics settings, which will provide closer to 30fps at the expense of some graphics quality.</p><p>The same goes for Where Winds Meet, which will experience a lot of pop-in while playing, which can be distracting. That said, it is a very big game, and you'd be better off playing it on a console.</p><p>Unfortunately, the 128GB of internal storage may keep you from downloading too many high-quality games anyway, although support for expandable storage may help if you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> lying around.

The overall experience isn't much different from Motorola's Android 15 software, with seemingly no instance of Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Material 3 Expressive</a>. That said, you get the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-set-up-and-use-modes">Modes</a> option borrowed from the Pixel that more or less takes over the Do Not Disturb button, letting you easily switch between pre-programmed or customized modes.</p><p>I was thoroughly surprised to see that bloatware was kept to a minimum. You could opt in to install some apps, but the only thing I had to disable after setup was the Games folder, which tries to shoehorn game recommendations from the Play Store. The Glance lock screen, tucked away in settings as "Smart lock screen," is also disabled by default, which I was happy to see.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no Always On Display, but you still get Motorola's Sleep display, which lets you interact with notifications and music controls without fully waking up the device. Motorola's gestures are also here, such as chopping the phone twice to turn on the flashlight, twisting it to turn on the camera, and a customizable quick-tap gesture that lets you double-tap the back of the phone. I was also happy to see the Sidebar option here for quick access to my favorite apps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="mx6QZfMJJp9ARG2z4TtVze" name="Moto-G-Power-2026-review-08" alt="Moto G Power 2026 side panel of apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mx6QZfMJJp9ARG2z4TtVze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While AI is seemingly everywhere these days, don't expect much of it here.

Most of the sensors are the same as those on the 2025 model, save for a new 32MP front-facing camera. That's not to say image quality is bad, but you won't be particularly impressed by the photos. You can get some decent images during the day with good lighting, but the photos lack detail and can get noisy otherwise.</p><p>That goes for the ultrawide camera too, which doubles as a macro sensor. You'd think there's a third camera sensor on the back, given the layout of the camera housing, but what looks like a third camera is actually an ambient light sensor that doesn't appear to offer much benefit.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span

It's 200mAh larger than its predecessor, and while I would've hoped for a significantly larger capacity to really drive home the "Power" in its name, it offers plenty of power. Motorola estimates up to two days, although I've been able to average just over one day with somewhat heavy use.</p><p>The 30W charging helps, though it'll take about 40 minutes to go from 1 to 50% and just under 2 hours to reach a full charge. Given the large battery, that's not too unexpected, although faster charging would be nice. Unfortunately, there's no wireless charging, which is an odd omission given its presence on last-year's model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rqnW8rFf3sZtqXoURkDmbe" name="Moto-G-Power-2026-review-7" alt="Charging the Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rqnW8rFf3sZtqXoURkDmbe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, the Moto G Power 2026 is a solid phone that feels too much like its predecessor. The $300 price is attractive enough that there's little reason not to buy one if you're looking for an affordable Android phone, but you can also get away with last year's model with more or less the same experience.</p><p>Of course, with Android 16 on board, you get OS upgrades up to Android 18 and updates until 2029, so that's an extra year of support if you really care for it.

If you think about it, it's one of those things that doesn't seem possible — something made of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-glass-bend">metal and glass can flip open and closed</a> as you like.</p><p>Of course, there are still things about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> to nit-pick over; if you're spending a lot of cash on something, it needs to seem worth it to you. Most of the things designers spend their time on aren't what the average consumer sees. Better hinges and thinner displays really don't stand out because you can't see them.</p><p>But you sure do see that crease.</p><h2 id="it-s-in-your-face-2">It's in your face</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="72cNt9ST9BUNSBHvvtPkQB" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-2" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 half-opened with Apple Music playing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/72cNt9ST9BUNSBHvvtPkQB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A slight indent in the screen along the line where a foldable actually folds doesn't interfere with anything. It's always been there, and everything still worked as designed.</p><p>If you've used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, you know the deal, but the fact is that most people haven't. I'm not talking about looking at one for three minutes at Best Buy, I mean buying one and using it every day.</p><p>The crease becomes sort of unnoticeable. It's still there, and you still see and feel it, but you stop caring about it because the display still looks good in that spot, and it's just as touch-sensitive as anywhere else on the screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4974px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wm367SscxJD8YYmy6CRhpP" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-taskbar" alt="Taskbar on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wm367SscxJD8YYmy6CRhpP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4974" height="2798" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>None of that matters. The first time you see a foldable phone in the flesh, one of the first things you might notice is a big, ugly line smack dab in the center of the display where you want to look at everything. It's enough to make you decide not to buy it.</p><p>I know this because it's one of the reasons I thought I'd never want one. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> really fits my lifestyle; I don't need a gargantuan display, so a "normal" sized phone that folds into something much smaller really works for me, but I didn't want one because of the line down the center of the screen.</p><p>I eventually noticed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr</a> at a price so good I did it anyway. I found that it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought and really not a reason to look away when it's time to buy. Yet, if I hadn't been able to get a brand new folding phone for like $300, I never would have bought it because of that crease.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3fnzv3Xc9w6C7E7fKgW3qN" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-display-unfolded-reading-google-books.jpg" alt="Reading a book on the Google Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fnzv3Xc9w6C7E7fKgW3qN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know I'm not the only person who thinks this way because I've heard plenty of other folks talk about that ugly, distracting fold line like it is some sort of phone leprosy. Guess what? Those people are right. If the crease is a reason not to buy a foldable, that's not a problem for you; it's a problem for the people making them.</p><p>While I haven't seen it in person, Samsung has shown off a foldable that doesn't have one. This is a big deal! Not because it will affect the performance or usability of the phone, but because it makes it look appealing to more people. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-galaxy-fold-hinge-work">better hinge</a> is a lot more important, but a hinge assembly will never matter as much as a line down the screen will to most of us.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cPWe7RSRfDuiKRCa4GW7jN" name="Samsung foldable creaseless panel" alt="Samsung creaseless panel showcased" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cPWe7RSRfDuiKRCa4GW7jN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not sure how they did it, and nobody from Samsung is ready to talk much about that yet; they're sort of busy right now. It's surely part trade secret and part common sense, done in a way that won't make anything weaker or more fragile. That's good enough for right now, but I still want to know everything I can about how they pulled it off. I understand how glass can bend and why the crease was there, and my curious side demands to be fed.</p><p>I'm also pretty certain this is why Apple has waited so long to build a foldable. Yes, it will have a crazy-high price tag, and the company will try to make it sound like they invented the technology, but one thing an Apple foldable would <strong>never</strong> have is a display with a crease down the middle.

It's perhaps the most intriguing entry for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace users</a> into the world of what is known as agentic artificial intelligence. This emerging technology uses AI agents that can take actions independently on your behalf to save you time and effort.</p><p>Google's CC optionally integrates with Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and the web to give you curated daily briefings. This early Google Labs experiment opened up to personal Google accounts in the U.S. and Canada in December, and users can sign up for the waitlist <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://labs.google/cc" target="_blank">here</a>. Availability is opening for Google AI subscribers first, starting with users on the Ultra plan.</p><p>While some gained access to CC within hours of joining the waitlist, I only received access over the weekend on a personal Google AI Pro account. It's unclear how many people Google is letting try CC at a time, but if you're an AI Pro subscriber like me who joined the waitlist, check for an introductory email from CC. Now that I've been using CC for a few days, it's clear that it might be the one AI tool to keep me on track.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U3kRduz9Yubbo3F37FiC4Q" name="Google-CC-3" alt="The Google CC agent in Gmail." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U3kRduz9Yubbo3F37FiC4Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The signup process for the experiment takes two steps: enabling <strong>Smart Settings</strong> in your Google Workspace settings and joining the waitlist on the Google Labs site. Once you gain access, you'll be able to chat with CC over email and receive daily reports. Here's how the experimental productivity agent could help streamline your workflows.</p><h2 id="what-it-s-like-to-have-cc-manage-your-inbox-2">What it's like to have CC manage your inbox</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AJn3WzXsV9sDouhMmw9hDQ" name="Google-CC-5" alt="The Google CC agent in Gmail." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJn3WzXsV9sDouhMmw9hDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your introduction to CC will likely start with the productivity agent proving how well it knows your inbox. In my case, CC started with the following standard welcome message:</p><div><blockquote><p>ⓒⓒ Hi Brady,👋 I'm CC, your new AI productivity agent from Google Labs. My job is to help you stay organized, get things done and ultimately give back time for what matters most.</p><p>CC</p></blockquote></div><p>Then, it veered into the realm of personal by saying "I'm already thinking about how you're managing your journalism career..." CC's immediate knowledge of me and the work I do with my Google account was certainly jarring yet impressive. But when you hand over your Gmail, Calendar, and Drive data to an AI agent, that's probably to be expected.</p><p>CC is both an autonomous helper and an on-demand chatbot. Users get a daily briefing that identifies action items, upcoming events, important emails and deals, and more. It's called "Your Day Ahead," and it can be customized to your liking by simply replying to the email with instructions. Alternatively, you can contact CC anytime by emailing the address for the agent, which is available in the following format: [your Google username]+cc@gmail.com.</p><p>It sounds like a better alternative to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-workspace-gets-a-much-needed-boost-with-geminis-new-smarts">Gemini in Workspace</a> for those that use their email as a do-it-all productivity tool. If you're the kind of person that sends emails to themselves instead of using a note-taking app, or one that uses Gmail as a cloud storage solution, CC will come in handy. It can remember information, summarize it, and search it.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mxixh5rNqn8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>CC has already made it impossible for me to forget the important details by resurfacing them on a daily basis. That includes events and deadlines you might have long forgotten. In its opening act, CC reminded me of a meeting I had set weeks ago, and it became an immediate lifesaver.</p><p>The agent includes hotlinks to source material and suggested actions in an effort to predict your next move. Depending on what it summarizes, CC might suggest you reply to a colleague, view a link, or add an event to your Google Calendar. Notably, these links don't seem to work reliably on mobile, and Google notes this is a known issue in the footers of emails from CC.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tXKLHS6QEcnaT6pnyBggHQ" name="Google-CC-4" alt="The Google CC agent in Gmail." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tXKLHS6QEcnaT6pnyBggHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can rate an email from CC with a simple thumbs up or down, or reply to it to ask a question, clarify something, or give detailed feedback for next time.</p><p>I currently have hundreds of thousands of unread emails across my various email accounts. No, I'm not proud of it. If we're being honest, I probably won't do anything about it anytime soon. That makes CC the perfect virtual personal assistant for me. It surfaces the important details and makes it easy to ignore the promotions and spam, allowing me to take command of my inbox for the first time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company states that while users have their views on ChatGPT and the assistance it can bring, it also wants to ensure its ads adhere to those expectations. OpenAI adds that its goal is to bring "truly relevant, high-quality ads," as well as control over them.</p><p>User choice/control was a key highlight for OpenAI moving forward with these upcoming ads. According to the post, users will have the option to disable personalization in ChatGPT, alongside the option to clear all "data used for ads at any time." OpenAI claims it will "always" give users a way to not see ads, which will be joined by a paid ad-free tier.</p><p>How intrusive ads will be was another talking point.</p><p>OpenAI states that ChatGPT's ads won't "influence" the AI's responses to queries. In fact, it states that the ads it will show will be "optimized" to be relevant to what you're doing. An example shows a user asking ChatGPT to help brainstorm ideas for a dinner party. While the AI responded as normal, offering dish suggestions, the "relevant" ad was for hot sauce from a grocery store.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.42%;"><img id="MgYPq3x4ifQiEHNPUTQJcJ" name="openai-chatgpt-ads-example" alt="OpenAI prepares ads in its ChatGPT chats, which will be present at the bottom and are designed to be "relevant" to what your query is." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MgYPq3x4ifQiEHNPUTQJcJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ads are planned to be clearly separated from the user's chat with the AI.

The post states that ads will first show up at the bottom of chats; however, there could be a future where users could query ChatGPT about the ad to make an educated decision before making a purchase.</p><h2 id="chatgpt-go-2">ChatGPT...

After debuting in India, OpenAI is now ready to bring its cheapest AI plan to the U.S. after reportedly observing a "high adoption rate." The post states that ChatGPT Go offers the company's GPT‑5.2 Instant model at a lower cost, which may entice more people to give it a try.</p><p>ChatGPT Go <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chatgpt.com/plans/go/">is available</a> for $8 a month.</p><p>At this lower price, ChatGPT Go gives users "10x more messages," file uploads, and image creation when compared to the free tier's capabilities. Additionally, the AI features a larger memory and context window with this Go tier, meaning it'll remember much more about you if you'd like.</p><p>OpenAI reports that many users who've engaged with ChatGPT Go typically leverage its intelligence for writing, learning, image creation, and problem-solving.

This would make the menu look a lot cleaner, more organized, and split instead of one large pull-down for everything.</p><p>This means that swiping from the left edge would show only notifications, while swiping from the right would bring up Quick Settings, neat right? That said, for Pixel users, this change seems to be optional.

It was created in tandem with its new partnership with Click Therapeutics. According to the post, the latter is an "FDA-authorized prescription digital therapeutic designed to offer both migraine-related insights and guided activities."</p><p>For Migraine PowerPlug, the feature is designed to give users support for harsh migraines while outside of the doctor's office, "in real-time."</p><p>Click's states that it's combining Ultrahuman's biomarker analytics capabilities with its digital therapeutic IP, CT-132. CT-132 has received FDA authorization to help users who suffer from migraines manage them and reduce the toll they take. Per the company's research, there are a few key areas in our daily lives that can contribute to terrible migraines. Areas such as your sleep quality, HRV (heart rate variability), stress load, and more can directly affect migraine patterns and strength.</p><p>Migraine PowerPlug is said to track these contributors to then "translate those trends into practical, personalized lifestyle guidance." Moreover, Click states that Migraine PowerPlug will identify patterns, so the user can improve. The post also highlights the importance of this feature, as women statistically experience migraines three times more than men.</p><h2 id="migraines-make-you-wanna-hide-and-never-come-out-2">Migraines make you wanna hide and never come out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-showing-logo.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air held in fingertips to show the Ultrahuman logo engraved inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nobody likes getting a migraine, but it looks like users still have a little while to wait. Click's states that its work with Ultrahuman to create Migraine PowerPlug will launch in "early 2026" in the Ultrahuman app. However, this will arrive "after a pilot phase." The companies are eyeing the U.S., Canada, the E.U, India, Australia, and a few more unnamed areas for this feature.</p><p>Ultrahuman's focus on women's health is nothing new, as the company has been down this road for a while now.

The company's newest in-app PowerPlug, Cycle & Ovulation Pro, was designed to help women understand their cycle, as not everyone falls within the "normal" 28-day range. Ultrahuman also stated that this PowerPlug could help women with PCOS and endometriosis.</p><p>Similarly, Ultrahuman <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman/ultrahuman-and-clue-team-up-to-help-women-take-control-of-their-cycle">partnered with Clue</a> to further enhance women's understanding of their cycle with insights and lifestyle tracking.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The change immediately makes Spotify Premium one of the most expensive music streaming services on the market, with the new individual plan costing $2 more per month than comparable options on Apple Music, Tidal, and YouTube Music.</p><p>Specifically, Spotify Premium Individual will cost $12.99 per month (up from $11.99), and Spotify Premium Student will cost $6.99 per month (up from $5.99). The company is raising the cost of Duo and Family plans by an even greater margin. The two-user Spotify Premium Duo tier will cost $18.99 per month (up from $16.99), while the Spotify Premium Family plan will cost $21.99 per month (up from $19.99).</p><p>As announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-01-15/premium-pricing-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, these new rates take effect immediately for new subscribers. Existing Spotify customers will be charged the increased prices starting at their next billing date. Spotify's short explanation of the price hike said the changes "reflect the value that Spotify delivers."</p><div><blockquote><p>Occasional updates to pricing across our markets reflect the value that Spotify delivers, enabling us to continue offering the best possible experience and benefit artists.</p><p>Spotify</p></blockquote></div><p>At the old price of $11.99 per month, Spotify's Premium Individual plan was already priced higher than the individual subscriptions for Apple Music, Tidal, and YouTube Music.</p><p>The old price was the same as Amazon Music Unlimited for non-Prime members, but Amazon Prime subscribers are eligible for a cheaper $10.99 per month rate. Now, Spotify is more expensive than every competitor listed above, and the gap is particularly wide for multi-user plans.</p><div style="min-height: 250px;">                                <div class="kwizly-quiz kwizly-XrPzBW"></div>                            </div>                            <script src="https://kwizly.com/embed/XrPzBW.js" async></script><p>While Spotify notes that pricing updates help it "benefit artists," the situation is more complicated than that. Spotify pays out a larger percentage of its revenue to music rightsholders (which pass on earnings to artists) than some competitors, like Apple Music. However, due to Spotify's pricing model, including a free tier, it ends up paying rightsholders less on a per-stream basis than Tidal and Apple Music.</p><p>If you uploaded a song to every major streaming service and it earned a thousand streams, Tidal would pay out the most, with Apple Music, Amazon Music Unlimited, Spotify, and YouTube Music following in that order.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2886px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6GmWWspavCffiJoLoBW3an" name="spotify-lossless-google-pixel-9" alt="Spotify lossless audio menu option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6GmWWspavCffiJoLoBW3an.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2886" height="1623" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The timing of the price hike isn't a good look for Spotify. It comes just a few months after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/spotify-lossless-audio-requires-this-gear-to-work">finally delivered lossless, CD-quality streaming for Spotify Premium subscribers</a> in September 2025. The move ended an embarrassing saga for Spotify, as it announced the feature in February 2021 but took nearly half a decade to release it.</p><p>The feature was included free with Spotify Premium when it debuted, but just a few months later, the price of that subscription service is going up. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-might-raise-prices-again-for-us-users-in-early-2026">Rumors of a Spotify price hike</a> started appearing just one month after Spotify Lossless became available.</p><p>Other streaming services, like Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music Unlimited, offer lossless streaming in higher quality than Spotify at lower monthly prices.</p><p>That's not to say Spotify isn't investing in upgrading its music streaming platform. It continuously adds features, but they may not be the ones music lovers want. Spotify added direct messaging to the app before adding support for lossless audio. It has also leaned into podcasts and audiobooks while cramming artificial intelligence tools into the app.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that Spotify fans rightly prefer the app's algorithm, recommendations, and social features over the competition, which are generally considered superior.</p><h2 id="is-it-time-to-leave-spotify-for-another-subscription-service-2">Is it time to leave Spotify for another subscription service?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6" name="youtube-music-hero.jpg" alt="youtube music hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spotify's latest price hike brings more attention to the fact that the music streaming service is actually not a great value compared to competitors. That is, despite the platform having the largest active user base of any music streaming service on the planet. For Android users in particular, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music and YouTube Premium look incredibly appealing</a> following Spotify's price change.</p><p>The standard YouTube Music Premium Individual plan costs $10.99 per month or $109.99 annually, although it's worth noting that YouTube Music lacks lossless audio support. The real value option is subscribing to YouTube Premium for $13.99 per month — just a dollar more monthly than the new Spotify Premium Individual plan, which grants you all the benefits of YouTube Premium <em>and</em> YouTube Music, as well as all the hidden gem remixes that you likely can't find on Spotify.</p><p>For lossless audio fanatics, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">I like both Apple Music and Tidal for just $10.99 per month</a> over Spotify. These streaming services deliver higher-quality lossless audio than Spotify. They also each offer Dolby Atmos tracks, which Spotify does not. Amazon Music Unlimited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-music-unlimited-getting-one-apple-musics-best-features">also offers high-res lossless and Dolby Atmos support</a>, but its base price before the Prime discount is higher than Apple Music and Tidal.</p><p>Is the Spotify price hike enough to finally push you to switch to a different streaming service? I use Apple Music, even on Android and Windows, and I love the no-nonsense experience. It's just a music app, prioritizing hi-res and immersive audio formats and omitting unnecessary features like podcasts, audiobooks, and AI. Now, it does all that while costing two dollars less per month than Spotify.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Allegedly, leaked details state OpenAI's earbuds, currently named "Sweet Pea," will contain strong hardware, specifically chips that are positioned to handle "high-performance" and AI computing.</p><p>Moreover, OpenAI might seek an open-ear-style design for these buds. Leaks indicate that the device in question features an egg-shaped body made of metal. There are also two "capsules" (or capsule-like objects) that will wrap around the ear and sit behind it against the user's head.</p><p>OpenAI has reportedly tapped Foxconn for the production of these earbuds, per this leak; however, that's not all. The post cites additional rumors that claim the company is also looking to produce four more AI-based devices for consumers. At the moment, rumors aren't clear about what these other products could be. What has been alleged is that OpenAI could look to achieve mass-production by the end of 2028.</p><p>OpenAI might position its codename "Sweet Pea" earbuds as a "portable AI gateway."

That's it, the whole enchilada. Energy still transfers the same way, and it functions just like the batteries you're used to, only it's a whole lot better. Why?</p><p>Changing the material the electrolyte is made of and changing its role make a handful of big differences. Mostly good ones. A "regular" battery is built like this:</p><p>You have two electrodes — a cathode (the positive pole) made of what's called a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cathwell.com/cathodic-protection-explained/" target="_blank">cathodic material</a> like lithium-iron phosphate, and an anode (the negative pole) made of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/anode-material" target="_blank">anodic material</a> like graphite or carbon.</p><p>Between the two sits a central separator and insulator made of polyethylene that prevents them from ever coming into direct contact.</p><p>The entire cell is filled with an electrolyte containing lithium salt. Both electrodes are submerged in this, and it allows lithium ions to move through between the positive and negative poles.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1548px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aR5umpaonXg2VoBZQj4EoW" name="battery-packs-169.jpg" alt="Battery packs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aR5umpaonXg2VoBZQj4EoW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1548" height="871" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The internals of a solid-state cell are completely different. No flammable liquids are involved because everything inside is solid. What changes are in bold below:</p><p>You still have a cathode, and it is still made from a "standard" cathodic material like LFP, the same as a traditional cell.</p><p>The separator is made of ceramic or a solid polymer that conducts. <strong>It also acts as the electrolyte.</strong></p><p><strong>The anode is made of pure lithium.</strong></p><p>Imagine filling a cardboard box with concrete, and before it dries, you stick two metal rods in it. It's sort of like that.</p><p>These changes make a big difference. A solid-state battery is <strong>safer</strong> than a traditional Li-ion cell because there is no flammable liquid that can leak or explode under pressure. This is reason enough alone to use them, but they're also battery batteries all-around.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4121px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sNpP6RJv7DXHdcu6ZoiUqX" name="Anker-MagGo-Power-Bank-5K-hands-on-08" alt="The Anker MagGo Power Bank 5K charging a Pixel 10 with a USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sNpP6RJv7DXHdcu6ZoiUqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4121" height="2318" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>They have a higher density</strong>. This means they can store more energy using the same footprint as a traditional cell. I have a 10,000 mAh portable battery pack that is actually <em>smaller</em> than a "regular" 5,000 mAh battery pack here on my desk. That means more life between charges without any increase in the size of your phone.</p><p><strong>They have a longer lifespan</strong>. As lithium ions are transferred and attracted inside the electrolyte, some are deposited as solid lithium on the negative electrode. Once this happens, these particles <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">no longer work to charge the cell</a>. This doesn't happen the same way in a solid-state battery, and it's theoretically possible to get up to 45,000 charging cycles from one. That's under the most perfect conditions, but in normal use, we can expect about double the lifespan compared to a "regular" battery.</p><p><strong>They safely charge faster</strong>. The negative electrode is what determines the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/faster-charging-isnt-the-answer-we-need-better-batteries">maximum safe charging time</a> of a lithium cell. With a solid electrolyte, higher charging and discharging rates are possible without overheating or volatility, since there is no liquid electrolyte.</p><p><strong>They work in the cold</strong>. Solid-state batteries remain efficient at low temperatures compared to standard lithium-ion cells. There is still a point where they cease to be efficient enough to operate, but you can use and charge a solid-state battery at colder temperatures.</p><h2 id="sounds-good-will-it-be-in-my-next-phone-2">Sounds good. Will it be in my next phone?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ErMAYgHCMkvNch3RFBGxvZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge compared to an iPhone 16 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ErMAYgHCMkvNch3RFBGxvZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Probably, but not just yet. Bummer, I know.</p><p>There are a few disadvantages to solid-state batteries: they're harder to manufacture because the anode "breathes" and slightly expands and contracts, making it harder to compress the entire package. They also still lose efficiency when the separator/electrolyte gets too cold, even if it's not as bad as a traditional cell. Mostly, though, it's the cost factor.</p><p>It costs more to design and build a solid-state battery, so companies making them have to charge more; changing what an electrode is made of is pretty easy, but retooling equipment to build batteries using a solid electrolyte isn't.</p><p>We've reached a point where the extra cost is justified enough, but just barely. If you want your next phone to automatically cost more, the company making it can cram a solid-state battery inside, but most people don't like that idea. Phone makers have to juggle the cost of building a device and the selling price to stay profitable.</p><p>You can already find solid-state battery packs from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.heybmx.com/collections/solid-state-power-banks">Better Mobile Xperience</a>. I've been using both their 5,000mAh and 10,000mAh batteries for a while, and they live up to the hype, but they're not cheap.</p><p>Of course, you can expect to see them in electric vehicles and industrial applications too, but we need to give it a little more time. Once the production issues are figured out, the price will drop, and manufacturers will be inclined to use them - especially in foldables.</p><p>Just know it's coming, and it's better!</p> ]]></dc:content>

Early rumors suggested Samsung might rename the base model to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/-may-not-be-an-s26-pro-either">Galaxy S26 Pro</a>, while other leaks claimed the Plus model would be replaced by a Galaxy S26 Edge. That later turned out not to be true, as reports indicated Samsung had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">scrapped the S26 Edge</a> in favor of keeping the Plus model.</p><p>That said, if there were still any doubts, Samsung's Colombian website may have just cleared things up. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/are-galaxy-s26-pro-edge-still-coming/">SamMobile</a>, Samsung Colombia accidentally published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://images.samsung.com/is/content/samsung/assets/co/tyc/20260110_20260331_tyc_0_Interes_Banco_Davivienda_Q1_2026_01_09.pdf">PDF document</a> outlining various product promotions.</p><p>Interestingly, the document also listed the Galaxy S26 series models, alongside the already-available Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. According to the PDF, the lineup will officially include the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26 Plus, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/s26-ultra-thinborne-case-leak">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>.</p><h2 id="samsung-seems-to-be-sticking-with-its-familiar-s-series-plan-2">Samsung seems to be sticking with its familiar S-series plan</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2704px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.45%;"><img id="U8FFUY2osF26P6foTfouzn" name="samsung-colombia-s26-series" alt="Galaxy S26 series on Samsung Colombia website" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8FFUY2osF26P6foTfouzn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2704" height="1310" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung Colombia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since these kinds of documents usually reflect finalized product names, it appears Samsung is sticking with its familiar three-phone strategy. This means the base model will not be renamed to Galaxy S26 Pro, and there will be no slim Galaxy S26 Edge at launch.</p><p>That said, there is still a possibility Samsung could introduce a Galaxy S26 Edge later in the year, similar to what it did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>For now, however, Samsung seems set on launching the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra. Leaks point to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-launch-date-reliable-leaker-confirms">February 25 launch</a> with the smartphone series going on sale in early March. The Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to bring some notable upgrades, including a larger battery with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-ultra-may-revolutionize-charging-with-new-60w-system-heres-the-scoop">60W fast charging</a> and a more refined design.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication found some strings in the source code that reference a feature called "Notify when left behind," which would send a notification to your Pixel Watch whenever you walk away without your phone.</p><p>For the feature to work, as per the report, a few prerequisites are required. Both the phone and watch need to have Bluetooth turned on, and the watch must be worn on your wrist, which is fairly obvious for something like this to function properly.</p><h2 id="google-is-finally-adding-a-phone-left-behind-alert-2">Google is finally adding a phone left-behind alert</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DJa2JBrhdkhXQtuEgLiKBd" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-and-Pixel-10-2" alt="Pixel Watch 4 on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DJa2JBrhdkhXQtuEgLiKBd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What makes this feature more interesting is that it will also automatically lock your phone if you walk away from it while it is still unlocked. This could be especially useful from a privacy standpoint if you accidentally leave your phone behind in a public place. The report also notes that you will be able to disable these alerts in trusted locations, such as your home.</p><p>That said, it is possible that Google may limit this feature to select new Pixel Watch models and some older models, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/final-farewell-googles-first-pixel-watch-receives-its-last-minor-update">original Pixel Watch</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-2">Pixel Watch 2</a>, may be left out. The code strings include a "Not supported watch" message, suggesting that some Pixel Watch variants could miss out.</p><p>For those familiar, similar features already exist on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/apple-watch-series-11-vs-google-pixel-watch-4">Apple Watch</a> and Samsung Galaxy Watch, but it is good to finally see Google working on bringing this functionality to the Pixel Watch.</p><p>There is no word yet on when or if this feature will officially roll out, as it has only been spotted in the source code so far. If Google does end up releasing it, we will be sure to update you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This feature appears to be the evolution of another intrusion tool that was reported early last year. The post states this feature will likely find a home in Android's Advanced Protections settings with a description that reads, "Preserves encrypted logs of some device activity in case of a security issue."</p><p>This is toggleable. If, when this arrives, users don't want to have this enabled, they're not forced to. However, after surfacing the feature early, the tipster's findings show that Google will connect users to a "trusted expert" if they need help after noticing suspicious digital movement.</p><p>These activity logs can only be accessed by using your Google account and lock screen credentials. According to a screenshot, what these logs will contain is reportedly "device connections, app installs, the last time your phone screen was unlocked, 'some' browsing history, and other data."</p><p>Seeing as these logs are incredibly important (and potentially sensitive), Google's code suggests it will house this for 12 months on its Cloud servers. However, there's a crucial note: these logs cannot be deleted manually. They will be removed from Google's Cloud servers on their own in 12 months.</p><h2 id="heightened-defenses-2">Heightened Defenses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="eQTA6uBBavT5b3kmQ2oQjW" name="android-16-intrusion-logging-feature-leak-details" alt="Android 16 reportedly preps an "Intrusion Logging" feature, which helps to keep track and alert users to suspicious activity regarding their device." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQTA6uBBavT5b3kmQ2oQjW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There seems to be a little bit of a name change here. When this feature was first rumored, it was called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-intrusion-detection-advanced-protection-code">Intrusion Detection</a>." Moreover, the feature was originally speculated to debut alongside Android 16 last year, but that never came to pass. Instead, those early rumors claimed Intrusion Detection would alert users to any suspicious activity regarding their device.</p><p>These encrypted logs about activity, which we've seen the tipster highlight today, were mentioned last year, too.</p><p>Strangely, the rumors then stated those logs would be placed in Google Drive (encrypted, still). The rumors seem to have changed, as the company might've opted to house them differently.</p><p>While it appears as though Intrusion Logging is mostly fleshed out, there's still no telling when it could roll out. There's hope that it's soon, though, as Google just debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr3-beta-2-released">Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2</a> this week. The update had an extensive list of fixes for enrolled Pixel phones for crashes, notification issues, and more. Perhaps we'll see Intrusion Logging appear with the next Android 16 QPR release.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> with messaging or live-tracking capabilities depend on your phone; these new models let you signal an SOS, broadcast your GPS location, or send messages and voice memos.</p><p>Satellite on smartwatches is a vital safety feature, one that's increasingly available on mainstream smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Google Pixel Watch 4</a>. And cellular connectivity ensures you're less dependent upon your phone to stay connected with family on long hikes.</p><p>It benefits Garmin to lean into its own satellite option, packed into watches that last significantly longer than competing brands.

Garmin could follow this pattern in 2026 (and attempt to maintain its profits) by re-releasing its best 2025 models with LTE and satellite capabilities, including the Instinct 3 Pro, Venu 4 Pro, and Forerunner 570 Pro, among others.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> is the most obvious fit, since it's tailored to hikers, but I could just as easily see trail runners preferring a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a> spinoff with satellite capabilities. And Garmin could theoretically stick to LTE for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-review">Venu 4</a> Pro, since its target audience might not benefit as much from satellite connectivity and would prefer a thinner design.</p><p>My preference would be a Forerunner 970 Pro or Venu X1 Pro, though the latter might be too skinny to make this work. The wider the selection of Garmin Pros, the safer people will be on long hikes and trail runs — and the more InReach subscriptions Garmin will sell.</p><h2 id="the-main-hurdle-to-more-garmin-pro-watches-the-antennas-2">The main hurdle to more Garmin Pro watches: The antennas</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hEceEPkZs6qZjVofdSqzGc" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-AMOLED-design" alt="The right side of the Garmin Instinct 3 50mm AMOLED, the photo focused on the two buttons and orange aluminum bezel, with blurred rocks in the background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEceEPkZs6qZjVofdSqzGc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Fenix 8 Pro 47mm measures 16mm thick, 2.2mm thicker than the non-Pro model. It's exactly the same for the Quatix 8 (13.8mm) and Quatix 8 Pro (16mm). Both Pro models also weigh slightly more (4g).</p><p>When Garmin released the Fenix 8 Pro, it told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/09/garmin-fenix-8-pro-lte-microled-satellite-messaging-hands-on-everything-you-need-to-know.html">DCR</a> that it couldn't sell a 43mm model "due to hardware limitations with integrating the LTE antenna." Both it and the InReach antenna were apparently too difficult to incorporate into a smaller design.</p><p>This means that a hypothetical Venu 4 Pro would only be available in the larger 45mm model. And since the Venu 4 measures 12.5mm thick, would the Venu 4 Pro need to be about 15mm thick to incorporate Garmin's antennas, or also 16mm? That would certainly detract from its style a bit.</p><p>Likewise, since the Garmin Instinct 3 already measures about 14.5–15mm thick, would a Pro version need to measure 17mm, or would its current thickness leave room for the new antennas? These are the design challenges that Garmin engineers are (hopefully) solving right now.</p><p>Whatever the case, I think plenty of Garmin fans will accept a thicker design if the Pro models remain relatively lightweight with consistent battery life, and offer them the peace of mind that comes with having satellite for worst-case scenarios.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But with a toddler in the house, it's just not feasible to get any gaming time, and while my wife manages to play Valorant for a few hours a week, the only game I played to any meaningful extent in the last year is Balatro.</p><p>This is where a service like GeForce Now comes in handy. At the outset, cloud gaming is all about convenience; you don't have to worry about hardware or configuration, and you can just focus on the game itself. While Microsoft has its own take on cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass, I like what NVIDIA is doing with GeForce Now a lot better — the service lets me play my own games on the cloud, and that's just great.</p><p>NVIDIA is on a mission to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/geforce-now">GeForce Now</a> to as many platforms as possible. It's now available natively on select Amazon streaming products alongside Samsung and LG smart TVs. What I particularly like is that there's a native Linux app, and the timing couldn't have been better; I'm getting increasingly frustrated with Windows (I just can't stand Windows 11) and have been mulling a wholesale switch to Ubuntu.</p><p>Linux gaming in general is much better than it was even a few years ago, and having a utility like GeForce Now available natively makes all the difference. In addition to expanding availability to other platforms, NVIDIA added flight stick integration to GeForce Now, and that is intriguing in and of itself when you consider the fact that the game itself is being streamed via a remote location.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BNBBZBHL5yK9o3RckWC4M" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-26.jpg" alt="Black Myth Wukong via NVIDIA GeForce Now on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BNBBZBHL5yK9o3RckWC4M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At CES 2026, NVIDIA showed off Microsoft Flight Simulator running on GeForce Now, and I was able to use a Logitech HOTAS to control the demo. While I'm abysmal with a flight stick, I at least noted that the input was near-instantaneous, and at no point did I feel that the game was being streamed via the cloud. More than anything else, this is what makes GeForce Now stand out.</p><p>The second part of the puzzle is availability; GeForce Now is available in over 60 countries globally, but there's an India-sized hole that NVIDIA is looking to remedy. The service was meant to debut in India last year, but that has been pushed to sometime in 2026, and with NVIDIA hosting the service on its own, I can't wait for it to become available. Microsoft rolled out cloud gaming in the country a few months ago, and with NVIDIA's imminent arrival, gamers in the country will get more choice, and that's always a good thing.</p><p>In my usage, I prefer GeForce Now as it lets me play the games I already own. I have an extensive catalog of Steam games I didn't get around to playing, and I have over a hundred titles on Epic I didn't even bother installing until now. Having the ability to play those games on any device is just convenient, and GeForce Now has the best image fidelity thanks to its use of custom RTX 5080 to power it. Now I just need to wait for the service to launch in the country so I don't have to use a VPN tunnel to play my games on the cloud.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the publication, Google's patent supposedly held details about a rework for how its battery is packaged in the device. Specifically, the company might chase a "removable battery" strategy, as opposed to one that's glued.</p><p>The publication, tipster collab discovered that Google could deploy "Shear stops." It was stated that this could "prevent the battery from sliding inside the smartphone frame."</p><p>The post claims that the patent went into more detail, stating that, since there's no glue, the Pixel 11 Pro Fold's battery could be slipped into a "metal battery frame." Early information purports that this is a chassis that the battery would sit inside, carrying the "electrical ground and adds strength." Moreover, Google could implement a spring-loaded mechanism.</p><p>These springs would help press the battery against the device's metal frame to ensure maximum connection.</p><p>The publication highlights this as a positive change, considering that glue can end up becoming a repairability nightmare over time. Take this with a grain of salt; there's no clear indication that this battery change will arrive for the Pixel 11 Pro Fold, as patents are never a true telltale sign.</p><h2 id="maybe-it-ll-be-better-next-time-2">Maybe it'll be better next time</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5038px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qD4G8QBwFiSsKyCpsKtRi" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qD4G8QBwFiSsKyCpsKtRi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5038" height="2838" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A future Pixel Pro Fold with enhanced durability is probably in Google's best interest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-fold-smokes-up-and-explodes-during-jres-durability-test">especially after it failed</a> Zach Nelson's (JerryRigEverything) test.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold, as most phones do, underwent Nelson's gruesome durability gauntlet, and it wasn't the same.

It took the best pieces from every digital gaming marketplace on the planet — the consumer-friendly return policies from Steam, developer relations and Q&A teams from companies like Sony and Nintendo, plus several other traits —  and made the Quest a platform worth investing in as a VR gamer and developer.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">AC thVRsday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC" name="ac-thvrsday-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="AC thVRsday logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.</p></div></div><p>That all began changing the moment Meta opened the floodgates for App Lab in mid-2024. I spoke with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/drakkenridge/6353835768070984/">DrakkenRidge</a> developer Cyril Guichard about the changes over the years, something he knows a lot about, as he's shipped 5 games since the days of the Oculus Go. Guichard shared that developing for Meta's Start Program from 2019-2022 was "the best experience I've ever had working with a publisher." But, since then, things have gone downhill.</p><p>Meta's goals began shifting after this time, and continued to change seemingly every six months, never long enough to see any goal properly executed. Meta is known for chasing trends as fast as it can and often moving without understanding the true repercussions of its actions. As Meta's Mark Zuckerberg once said about new Facebook features back in 2014, "move fast and break things."</p><p>And broke things, they have. January 13, 2026, will go down as a date that no one in the VR community will likely forget. Android Central reached out to Meta for comment on this article, but didn't receive a response in time for publishing.</p><h2 id="a-virtual-bloodbath-2">A virtual bloodbath</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9GiYBHqbVUNdzkifVsHPM4" name="meta-horizon-app-mobile-games-with-meta-quest-3" alt="Mobile games in the Meta Horizon app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9GiYBHqbVUNdzkifVsHPM4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On January 13, 2026, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/reality-labs-january-2026-rumored-cuts">Meta closed</a> most of its first-party game development studios. The few employees remaining at studios like Within and Camouflaj will likely be holding "maintenance" duty on live service titles like Supernatural, while Camouflaj's remaining developers are said to be working on an onboarding tutorial that users will experience when they start up the next Meta Quest headset.</p><p>After speaking with many developers, many of whom wanted to remain anonymous for this story, I was told that Oculus Publishing has also seen substantial cuts. Many developer relations contacts within the Meta Horizon Start Program, a developer incubation and funding program, have been laid off, with "just a handful" remaining, per one source. Almost certainly, this means that the $60 million Meta has allegedly spent to fund VR games so far in 2026 is the last we'll see from the program.</p><p>As such, the massive shift didn't just affect first-party Oculus Studios development. Cloudhead Games, maker of the uber-popular Pistol Whip rhythm shooter VR game, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/cloudhead-games-lay-off-70-percent-staff-2026/">laid off</a> 70% of its workforce. Skydance Games has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/harry-potter-vr-game-cancelled-report/">reportedly also canceled</a> an official Harry Potter VR game due to funding program shifts within Meta. The total extent of the fallout remains to be seen, but it's not looking pretty.</p><p>As Anshel Sag, Principal Analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told me, "I think Meta is destroying all of the goodwill it created as the 'savior' of VR gaming. I think Meta is causing irreparable damage to the industry, both in how it acquired these companies and how it's run them and their properties."</p><h2 id="the-vr-gaming-recession-has-begun-2">The VR gaming recession has begun</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yEqLoxLpVofgGAN5uSbkb9" name="meta-quest-3-controller-with-AMVR-grips-01.jpg" alt="Grabbing a Meta Quest 3 controller that has AMVR grips attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yEqLoxLpVofgGAN5uSbkb9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What does all this mean for VR gamers and developers? For starters, Meta no longer seems to be interested in making first-party games, but there's no evidence that Meta is abandoning VR altogether or even exiting the hardware market. If anything, Meta seems to be taking a "Valve approach" to gaming, which means it'll focus on a wild west-style digital marketplace and only develop hardware.</p><p>Valve rarely invests in projects unrelated to its own ambitions, mostly of which comprise its IPs like Half-Life and Counter-Strike, plus software investment into tools like Proton and FEX, the latter of which makes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/steam-frame-steam-deck-meta-quest-3">the upcoming Steam Frame</a> standalone VR headset possible. Valve has publicly stated it does not have any VR games in development, and Meta seems to be following the same tactic.</p><p>Meta recently announced that Horizon OS, which powers Quest headsets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-scraps-horizon-os-partners-to-focus-on-the-quest">will no longer be going third-party</a>, which means it'll only be built for Meta's own hardware. Project Phoenix, pictured in a mockup below, is said to be the Quest 4's form factor, favoring a more smart-glasses-like size and shape with VR headset capabilities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2634px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.32%;"><img id="w5menaReGjXp2KkbYQ5LaN" name="reality-labs-phoenix-mock-up-luna" alt="A mock-up of Reality Labs' Phoenix ultralight VR headset prototype made by Luna on X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w5menaReGjXp2KkbYQ5LaN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2634" height="1747" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @Lunayian on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-xr-2026-what-we-expect-want-to-see">I made predictions</a> about the XR market in 2026, I didn't expect the industry to shift focus so hard and fast, particularly for Meta. Not only is Meta seemingly abandoning the idea of becoming the next Nintendo or Sony, but it's pivoting hard to trying to become the first company to produce truly mass-market smart glasses by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-to-boost-ray-ban-smart-glasses-production-amid-surging-demand-aiming-for-20-million-units">doubling or tripling the output</a> of its Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses this year.</p><p>The result is that we're almost certainly not going to see big-name titles hit VR headsets for a long while. Meta-funded AAA titles like Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, Batman Arkham Shadow, Asgard's Wrath 2, Deadpool VR, and many others of its caliber relied entirely on Meta funding, which has now significantly dried up.</p><p>Even indie games will be affected, as several developers have historically relied on the Meta Start Program to fund their salaries during development. "Nearly every indie megahit in the last 5 years came from the Start program first," VR developer RJ told me in a written interview on X (formerly Twitter), and that spells trouble for future releases.</p><h2 id="cutting-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face-2">Cutting off your nose to spite your face</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gy6tBWc4LzPPznAaFTLSjC" name="meta-quest-2-pro-3-straight.jpg" alt="The Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 3 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gy6tBWc4LzPPznAaFTLSjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many people are, understandably, pissed off at Meta, and with good reason. More than one developer has now told me that they're considering dropping future development for <em>all</em> Meta hardware, including any potential smart glasses apps, because of the way Meta has handled things over the past 2-3 years. January 13 was just the straw that broke the camel's back.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/xrdevrob/status/2011349410329112692?s=20">One developer</a> simply said, "Give me one reason to keep building for Meta Quest and/or Meta wearables." While some responses have been positive, most people seem to feel like Meta just blew its last ounce of goodwill with this move. Meta has, essentially, put itself in Google's unenviable position of being accused of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">killing projects</a> too early.</p><p>While some investors and financial publications have been calling for these moves for years, Meta has largely resisted full-on cuts like this because it seemed to be aiming for a specific vision of the future, but never truly stuck with a plan long enough to bear fruit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4vdPneyyG52ziTt3Mgfmia" name="meat-quest-3s-with-box-2025" alt="A Meta Quest 3S with the Meta Breathable Facial Interface attached, next to the Meta Quest 3S 256GB box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4vdPneyyG52ziTt3Mgfmia.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Circling back around to Guichard and his development experience over the lifetime of the Quest family since 2019, it's clear the "wonder years" were from 2019-2022. Once Meta began changing tactics and laying off staff, things (unsurprisingly) got worse.</p><p>The magic of the curated Quest store started evaporating overnight when Meta got rid of its curation system in Summer 2024. Games that used to have to pass rigorous QA processes were now greenlit after "the most basic of VR tests," according to several developers I've spoken to. Swaths of Gorilla Tag clones suddenly flooded the market, and Meta started prioritizing Horizon Worlds over paid content, causing legitimately good games to be drowned out.</p><p>Several months later, developers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-joining-forces-to-solve-the-vr-visibility-crisis">banded together to help solve</a> the "visibility crisis." While Meta has somewhat helped clean up the curation process in the 18 months since these choices were made, the damage was irreparable. Despite delivering the bigger, better games Meta was calling for from its Start Program developers, the company seemed to have forgotten to follow through on its promises.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Rw2hkFvvjgqhizkWKkNkRZ" name="meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-official-lifestyle-halo" alt="A visual representation of Halo gameplay on a Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rw2hkFvvjgqhizkWKkNkRZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the reason we have so many VR releases these days is because of Meta's Start Program.

Everyone was fooled."</p><p>Meta has long provided excellent opportunities for VR developers to make games people care about and want to play, and for its part, deserves credit in attempting to solve the "chicken and egg" scenario VR has been in for years.</p><p>In other words, without Meta's critical funding, we likely never would have seen the AAA titles we got, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/its-time-for-the-meta-quest-to-focus-on-stability-not-capability">years of fiddling</a> with the Quest's digital marketplace may very well have driven out any real chance of long-term success.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CvqfJCTdHVifBz5A8H4q65" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-Screenshot-04" alt="A screenshot from Batman Arkham Shadow taken on a Meta Quest 3 headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CvqfJCTdHVifBz5A8H4q65.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Batman Arkham Shadow exceeded internal sales expectations, even those numbers are substantially lower than what's needed to sustain a thriving AAA ecosystem like what's enjoyed on the PS5. Even big indie games like DrakkenRidge are selling 15x lower numbers of units than the developer's previous games, a direct result of Meta's toying with things rather than trying to maintain stability.</p><p>From here on out, it's clear that VR developers will need to be cautious about investments and which platforms to prioritize. Without Meta's financial backing, projects that were once zero risk will now suddenly face big stakes. If boutique VR publishers also pull out, as some fear they might, it's going to be another long, quiet road for VR until the next round of funding hits in a few years from now.</p><p>Until then, I'll keep enjoying excellent VR games like Walkabout Mini Golf and Deadly Delivery with friends.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With the ongoing RAM crisis pushing component costs through the roof, the writing was on the wall. We expected the next budget Pixel to either jump in price or get stripped to the bone.</p><p>But a new leak shows Google has other plans. Reliable tipster @MysteryLupin says the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Google Pixel 10a</a> will launch early and could be even cheaper than the last model.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Retailer listings suggest the Google Pixel 10a could launch on Feb 17, 2026.• 128 GB: ~€500Colors: Obsidian, Berry, Lavender, Fog• 256 GB: ~€600Color: Obsidian• Official cases: ~€20Colors match phone lineup<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2011134750979997802">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>If the new leak is accurate, the phone could launch on February 17, which is much earlier than usual. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/word-on-the-street-is-the-pixel-10a-is-headed-for-shelves-in-february">matches an earlier leak about the release date</a>.</p><p>The main news is that the 128GB Pixel 10a is expected to cost about €500 in Europe.</p><p>For context, the Pixel 9a launched at €549. In a market where most companies blame price hikes on inflation, a €50 price drop is rare.</p><p>Direct currency conversions are tricky (about $582), but this European price suggests Google may aim for a price below $499 in the U.S. It could even be as low as $449, which would beat many competitors.</p><h2 id="the-trade-off-2">The trade-off</h2><p>Before you get too excited, it’s important to see how Google might make this possible. Rumors say the specs are very similar to last year’s model. The device is expected to use the same Tensor G4 chipset as the Pixel 9a, instead of the newer G5 chip found in the flagship series.</p><p>Leaked images show a phone that looks almost the same as last year’s model. The specs also match, with 8GB of RAM and a 5,100mAh battery.</p><p>Even though the hardware might be the same, the colors are new. The 128GB model is tipped to land in four colors: Obsidian, Berry, Lavender, and Fog. If you need the larger 256GB storage (priced around €600), just make sure you like black, because Obsidian is the only leaked option for the higher tier.</p><p>By apparently recycling the chassis and processor, Google may sidestep the component price hikes plaguing other manufacturers. It may seem like a small update, but for anyone wanting a reliable camera and clean software under $500, it’s a win.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Out of the gate, MediaTek states these chips are designed to bolster the flagship and premium phone markets, as it looks to bring more competition to Qualcomm. The Dimensity 9500s takes center stage, built on a 3nm process and rocking MediaTek's All-Big-Core structure.</p><p>This structure includes a Cortex-X925 ultra core, clocked at speeds up to 3.73GHz. MediaTek paired it with three Cortex-X4 premium cores and four Cortex-A720 performance cores.</p><p>Though it features that "S" tag, the company says this chip can still join the big leagues with a flagship NPU. This NPU is designed to handle "generative reasoning and multi-modal models" for a phone's camera and "content generation capabilities." Essentially, this concerns the post-processing of live photos, AI photo editing tools, AI summaries, and more.</p><p>Speaking of creating content, the Dimensity 9500s features the MediaTek Imagiq image processor for 30fps motion tracking and 8K full-focus Dolby Vision HDR recording.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:973px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.66%;"><img id="VSVJW3aTixeA9yPyu8a287" name="mediatek-dimensity-9500s-info" alt="The MediaTek Dimensity 9500s aims to the premium and flagship phone markets with strong GPU and NPU upgrades to help users with games and AI tools." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VSVJW3aTixeA9yPyu8a287.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="973" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MediaTek)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Power and content generation are major highlights for the Dimensity 9500s; however, MediaTek's not shying away from its gaming power.</p><p>The 9500s features an Immortalis-G925 GPU, capable of handling intensive games, such as Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves, and more.

Unlike the 9500s, the 8500 offers eight Cortex-A725 cores with speeds up to 3.4GHz.</p><p>MediaTek focused its efforts elsewhere with the 8500, as it debuts it with "accurate scheduling technology and LPDDR5X 9600Mbps memory" support. The post states this was done to help foster a smoother phone experience for Android users, as well as a device battery life that can go further.</p><p>The Mali-G720 GPU aims to reduce power consumption by 25% when compared with MediaTek's older generation. This SoC also upgraded its gaming engine, bringing faster loading times, higher energy efficiency, and more to mobile gamers.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Mediatek <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9500-is-android-powerhouse-with-major-performance-gains">launched the Dimensity 9500</a> back in September, its response to Qualcomm's major flagship chip reveal. This chip is an Android powerhouse with an octo-core setup and a 32% power boost over the 9400. The GPU was upgraded, capable of pulling 120fps in games with ray tracing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While products from both companies are comparable in many ways, Xreal alleges that Viture's technology is simply <em>too</em> similar to their own to be a coincidence, and the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-deals-blow-to-viture-with-patent-victory-and-german-sales-ban">filed a patent lawsuit</a> in late December in Germany to challenge that claim.</p><p>Now, Xreal is taking the fight to another country in which it holds patents — the United States — making the same claims that Viture is unlawfully utilizing Xreal's U.S. Patent No. 11,988,839 in specific models of smart glasses. Xreal specifically names the Viture Pro XR glasses as the model leading to infringement, but states that other Viture glasses may fall under the umbrella, depending on what the court decides.</p><p>Xreal says it's making moves to defend its patents ahead of expected massive market growth in XR glasses. Xreal cites <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-market">a research firm's claim</a> that the market will grow 6x in the next 10 years, becoming a nearly $700 billion market by 2035.

Viture's previous statement was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-deals-blow-to-viture-with-patent-victory-and-german-sales-ban">included in our article</a> about the lawsuit in Germany back in December.</p><p>Viture claims the patent was filed recently, but Xreal says the patent dates back to 2018 and was only granted in 2024, hence the discrepancy. I spoke with Anshel Sag, Principal Analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, ahead of the news, as he was also briefed on the matter, and he confirmed the dates to me.</p><p>Furthermore, Sag told me that "the patents that Viture has aren't even filed in the US, which is in contrast to XREAL, which has both patents in the US and Germany." Xreal maintains that they hold over 800 patents worldwide and says Viture only holds around 70, although this number is difficult to confirm.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L4oVdyvD6KUot5TRSZnAKA" name="xreal-eye-installed-on-xreal-one-glasses-01" alt="The Xreal Eye camera installed in a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L4oVdyvD6KUot5TRSZnAKA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal was founded in Beijing in 2017 and filed the patent in question roughly one year after its founding. Xreal began as Nreal but changed the company name in 2023. Viture was founded in 2021, also in Beijing.</p><p>History often repeats itself, so it's unsurprising to see that Magic Leap sued Xreal, then called Nreal, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684164/magic-leap-nreal-light-chi-xu-lawsuit-ar-glasses-design-ripoff">back in 2019</a> over nearly identical claims of using patented designs.

If the courts confirm Xreal's claim, Viture will likely end up needing to pay Xreal a licensing fee or face a product ban in the U.S. and Germany until its designs are changed.

After months of confusion and online speculation, Samsung updated the fine print on its Galaxy AI support pages to make one thing clear: the core Galaxy AI tools you use today will remain free forever.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> launched with the Galaxy S24 series, Samsung said basic AI features would be free “through 2025.” The fine print made it seem like you might have to pay after that.</p><p>This unclear message left many users unsure if tools like Photo Assist, Writing Assist, or Interpreter would soon cost a monthly fee.</p><h2 id="basic-galaxy-ai-tools-are-locked-in-at-no-cost-2">Basic Galaxy AI tools are locked in at no cost</h2><p>Now, Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/galaxy-ai/" target="_blank">changed the footnote</a> to say clearly: “Galaxy AI basic features provided by Samsung are free.” The company also makes it clear that future paid options could be added, but only for enhanced tools or features not included in the basic set (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ai-features-free-3632510/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Third-party AI features, such as Google’s Circle to Search, are separate and may have their own terms.</p><p>So, what stays free? Samsung lists its basic AI suite in the “Advanced Intelligence” section of its terms. This includes main features like Call Assist, Writing Assist, Photo Assist, Interpreter, Note & Transcript Assist, Browsing Assist, Now Brief, and Audio Eraser.</p><p>Galaxy AI has been central to Samsung’s software strategy since the One UI 6.1 update in 2024, which brought the suite to both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship Samsung phones</a> and some older devices. These on-device and cloud-based tools are designed to make everyday tasks, such as photo editing and language translation, faster and easier.</p><p>Keep in mind that Samsung has not ruled out paid AI add-ons in the future. The new statement only guarantees that the basic tools will stay free.</p><p>It also leaves room for enhanced features or new services that could cost money later. Third-party AI services are not included in this guarantee and may have their own pricing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It also boasts powerful performance backed by an Intel chip, an impressive number of ports, and a price tag that feels fair, even before the discount.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant downside is the device's lack of a fingerprint scanner, and the fact that this is the computer's only available configuration. There are also some laptops around this price point that seem to have a better handle on battery life, though perhaps none that match this computer's level of performance.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$749.99" data-dimension48="$749.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="Pi7ajZEnHcHEyEdL3TyiTV" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-render-space.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pi7ajZEnHcHEyEdL3TyiTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$749.99" data-dimension48="$749.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$749.99</del> <strong>$599.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Best Buy is starting the year off right with $150 off the price of our favorite Chromebook Plus on the market, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>.

This laptop is also Samsung's lightest and slimmest laptop, making it an ideal pick for anyone who needs something especially portable.</p><p>Samsung says this laptop will get up to 13 hours of battery life per charge, and while that's plenty for most casual users, those who want an industry-leading device in this regard may be able to find that elsewhere—even if it means spending a bit extra.</p><p>However, for those who don't need the absolute best battery option or an onboard fingerprint scanner, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is a solid pick, and even more so at just $600.</p> ]]></dc:content>

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has launched a dedicated website called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chatgpt.com/translate/">ChatGPT Translate</a>, putting it in direct competition with Google's translation service.</p><p>At launch, the service supports over 50 languages and looks familiar to anyone who has used online translation tools. You get two text boxes, one for input and another for the translated output, along with drop-down menus to select the source and target languages. Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/this-is-everything-in-google-translates-three-big-updates-rolling-out-for-android">Google Translate</a>, ChatGPT Translate also supports automatic language detection.</p><h2 id="openai-quietly-launches-a-new-google-translate-rival-2">OpenAI quietly launches a new Google Translate rival</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.94%;"><img id="TDdPgXwYN3FYXV2q7pAWB6" name="chatgpt-translate-working" alt="ChatGPT Translate in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TDdPgXwYN3FYXV2q7pAWB6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3300" height="2440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can start typing text immediately, with translations appearing live as you type.

Here is the full changelog of what is included in the latest beta build.</p><h2 id="here-s-everything-that-the-android-16-qpr3-beta-2-fixes-2">Here's everything that the Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 fixes</h2><ul><li>An issue where the app drawer could become unresponsive when scrolling, which required updates to how UI elements were rendered.</li><li>Android Auto incorrectly logs extensive screen time, impacting battery life.</li><li>Graphical glitches and performance degradation when interacting with  the notification shade in full-screen or PiP modes by improving display  rendering.</li><li>An excessive battery drain issue occurring overnight by optimizing background process power consumption.</li><li>An issue where the battery charging limit was not being respected causing devices to charge to 100% instead of the set limit.</li><li>An issue where users experienced slow internet speeds on Wi-Fi due to a Wi-Fi connection bug.</li><li>A crash when accessing radio information settings.</li><li>Users experienced a noticeable delay and lack of feedback when  switching audio outputs to speakerphone during calls; this was resolved  by improving audio routing logic.</li><li>A display issue causing screen flickering when waking the device from Always-On Display by updating system webview.</li><li>An issue where certain apps, including Microsoft applications  managed by Intune, were crashing on startup due to a compatibility  problem with the Android system that has now been resolved.</li><li>An issue causing inconsistent or failed wireless charging and slow wired charging by improving the power management system.</li><li>System crashes that occurred when folding a foldable device with an  app open by fixing an issue with activity lifecycle management during  device state changes.</li></ul><p>Beyond bug fixes, Google has also made noticeable changes to the Settings app UI. Previously, navigating to <strong>Settings > System</strong> presented a long, uninterrupted list of options like Language & region, Keyboard, Navigation mode, and Gestures, with little visual separation.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.51%;"><img id="CVijgyMrj87JERVN8PL3MZ" name="android-16-qpr-3-beta-2-settings" alt="Android 16 QPR3 beta 2's redesigned system setting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CVijgyMrj87JERVN8PL3MZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3280" height="2444" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Old System Settings (left) vs New (Center and Right) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With Android 16 QPR3 beta 2, these options are now grouped into clearly defined sections for easier navigation (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2026/01/14/android-16-qpr3-beta-2-everything-new/">9to5Google</a>). For example, keyboard, gestures, and navigation mode now live under an "Interaction" section, while system updates have their own "Update device" subsection. While search has always been available, the new layout makes it easier to quickly spot and access specific settings.</p><p>Android 16 QPR3 beta 2 is now rolling out as an OTA update for beta testers. The update carries build numbers CP11.251209.007.A1 and CP11.251209.007 and requires <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">enrollment in the Android Beta Program</a>. It supports Pixel devices ranging from the Pixel 6 series to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 lineup</a>.</p><p>If you prefer not to install the beta via OTA, you can manually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr3/download-ota">flash factory images</a> onto your device. Otherwise, you can wait for the stable Android 16 QPR3 release, which is expected to roll out around March 2026</p> ]]></dc:content>

The user is flabbergasted, as their title points out that their display "is out." The report concerns the main 10-inch internal display, as the user posted a photo of their display and the heartwrenching strip of dead space on the left side.</p><p>This strip of dead pixels seems right about where the left-most panel would fold over. The user says that the display for their "trifold that I bought a month ago went out. There was no external shock at all."</p><p>Its the fact that they've reported no external shock damage (on their part or otherwise) that's the most concerning. The user begins to question the overall durability of Samsung's Galaxy Z TriFold, considering this unfortunate damage seemingly showed up on its own.</p><p>Both the original poster and a commenter made note of a crucial fact: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-my-biggest-concerns">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> is not covered by Samsung's insurance.

There are no insurance products available." The original poster made note of that, too, which is where their conundrum begins, as they've nowhere left to turn.</p><h2 id="an-expensive-device-with-an-expensive-issue-2">An expensive device with an expensive issue</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:810px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.07%;"><img id="3LzW9invuBueiDbATBf8YY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-left-display-damage" alt="A user's photo of a line of dead pixels down the left-most strip on their Galaxy Z TriFold's main display panel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3LzW9invuBueiDbATBf8YY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="810" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung Community Forum)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All isn't lost (well, not entirely), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-z/%ED%8A%B8%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%ED%8F%B4%EB%93%9C-%EC%95%A1%EC%A0%95%EC%9D%B4-%EB%82%98%EA%B0%94%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/td-p/36534076#:~:text=It%20won%27t%20cost%20much.%20You%20can%20use%20a%2050%25%20coupon%20and%0Aget%20it%20fixed%20for%20about%201.3%20million%20won.">as one user</a> reminds the original poster about the 50% coupon for their first repair. Still, the price is likely to sit on the distasteful side, as Galaxy Z TriFold parts aren't cheap by any degree.</p><p>Durability concerns, especially for foldables, are always in question. The devices are, quite literally, built differently, and the idea of needing to <em>fold </em>a screen can cause problems. Last summer, there were concerns about Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 as show units in stores were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-store-display-units-already-showing-signs-of-potential-hinge-damage">already showing problems</a> with their hinges. Users on Reddit who spotted the phones in stores on display said they weren't "unfolding all the way."</p><p>Snapshots taken from stores showed that the devices retained a slight bend when trying to unfold them all the way. Needless to say, they weren't sitting completely flat.</p><p>It was brought to attention that the device in question was probably just a one-off. Issues like this weren't exactly widespread once the device hit consumers' hands, so that's one thing to feel good about. For the Galaxy Z TriFold, it remains to be seen if things evolve further than this one user's report. Though unfortunate, if consumers continue to report this, Samsung might have a bigger issue on its hands.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In their tests, Ice Universe claims that Samsung's One UI system "is smoother and more responsive." Additionally, they state "touch response, animations, and overall fluidity have improved."</p><p>Rumors diverge into two paths from here.

According to Mystic Leaks on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/mysticleaks/149" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, Android could soon have a cleaner, more organized split instead of one large pull-down for everything.</p><p>Currently, Android’s notification shade and Quick Settings share the same crowded space on stock devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. Pull down once for notifications, and pull again for toggles. It works, but it’s messy, especially on large phones where everything feels stacked together.</p><p>The latest leak says Google is testing a true split layout in Android 17. This means that swiping from the left edge would show only notifications, while swiping from the right would bring up Quick Settings.</p><p>If this seems familiar, it’s because brands like Samsung and Xiaomi already use a similar approach. The difference is that Google would make this official in Android itself, instead of leaving it to custom skins.</p><p>For regular Pixel users, this change seems to be optional. You’ll probably be able to go to Settings > Notifications and switch between the classic "Combined" view and the new "Separate" layout, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr1-split-quick-settings-3562165/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reported earlier.</p><p>However, if you have a tablet or a foldable, you might not have a choice. The leak says split-view mode will be required on large-screen devices. On a Pixel Fold, you could switch to split view on the inner screen, while only the outer screen might let you go back to the classic merged look. This makes sense for bigger screens, but forcing power users to change their workflow is always a bit risky.</p><h2 id="wi-fi-and-mobile-data-toggles-may-finally-stop-being-annoying-2">Wi-Fi and mobile data toggles may finally stop being annoying</h2><p>The second upgrade is more subtle and, some would say, long overdue.</p><p>Android 12 brought in the combined Internet toggle, which made you use a mini menu to switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data. Google said this helped prevent accidental disconnects, but users felt it made things harder. That debate is still ongoing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1155px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:137.32%;"><img id="xXqkUTUrLj2n4TNVKCoc39" name="Quick-Settings-toggle-for-internet-and-mobile-data" alt="Quick Settings toggles for internet and mobile data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xXqkUTUrLj2n4TNVKCoc39.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1155" height="1586" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new leak suggests Android 17 could bring back separate toggles for Wi-Fi and mobile data. Mystic Leaks says Google is testing layouts that load faster and give you one-tap access.</p><p>This way, casual users have fewer accidental taps, while power users get faster control. It’s a rare win-win for Android’s interface.</p><p>Of course, none of these changes are guaranteed yet. They’re still hidden in early Android 17 builds, so Google could change, delay, or even cancel them before launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, summaries are only available in English.</p><p>Notification summaries are designed to work with long messages or group chats from messaging apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, Android Messages, WhatsApp, and others. It's not intended for short texts, so AI summaries will not generate in some cases. AI summaries will only generate if your screen is turned off briefly, and will not appear when you're using your phone.</p><p>When a notification is summarized using AI, a sparkle icon will appear beside the generated text. You can tap the summary to reveal the full message.</p><p>It's worth noting that a separate AI feature for notifications, Notification Organizer, debuted alongside AI summaries.

Under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=Q0010001">Taiwan's Cross-Strait Act</a>, Chinese companies are prohibited from conducting business or hiring employees in Taiwan without explicit government approval.

That branch reportedly handled research and development, as well as verification and testing work for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus smartphones</a>, actions that prosecutors say violated existing cross-strait agreements.</p><p>Android Central reached out to OnePlus for comment, and the company responded by saying that its "business operations continue as normal and are unaffected."</p><p>From Taiwan's perspective, the case is being treated as a matter of national security. The country has been increasingly focused on protecting its technology ecosystem and has repeatedly raised concerns about the outflow of talent and intellectual property to China.</p><p>While there have been similar cases in the past, Lau's involvement is notable given his role as CEO of OnePlus and Chief Product Officer at Oppo.

At least a dozen tech brands, most notably Lenovo, pushed a specific AI concept: small wearable gadgets that record and transcribe everything around you, to remember later.</p><p>People have accepted AI wearables like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta</a> glasses or smartwatches, with familiar form factors and features <em>besides</em> AI.

Fun names aside, these models are known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and Gemini 3 Pro Image. Google put its best image-generation models in users' hands by making Nano Banana Pro available for three images per day, and consumers are clearly loving it.</p><p>Google's vice president of Gemini and Google Labs, Josh Woodward, took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/joshwoodward" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter)</a> to announce that users have generated over a billion images with Nano Banana Pro. Woodward noted that this model was only available for 53 days when the major milestone was crossed, signaling that there's significant demand for Nano Banana Pro.</p><p>Since free users only get three Nano Banana Pro generations or edits per day, crossing this threshold suggests <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> users are trying out and returning to the image-generation model. It could also indicate that paid users are taking advantage of Nano Banana Pro access, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro</a> subscribers get 100 images daily and Ultra subscribers get 1,000.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crossed 1 billion images Nano Banana Pro images in @GeminiApp!

Although text generation is a typical pain point for AI image generators, Nano Banana Pro crosses this hurdle easily with the ability to write text in a variety of languages. There are applications beyond basic image edits or cartoon-style generations, such as creating presentation slides or educational charts.</p><p>Users can try out detailed prompts that tell Nano Banana Pro exactly what to do, and then watch the magic happen. Since this is a thinking model, you can trace Gemini's steps as it worked on how to tackle the Nano Banana Pro request. In the example below, a long prompt was used to create an isometric miniature representation of a city.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Dw7ieTGyMC3hkHe7JXHoqb" name="Gemini-3-7" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dw7ieTGyMC3hkHe7JXHoqb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You'll notice that not only does the output contain legible text using personalized typography, but it also looks clean and accurately matches the prompt instructions.</p><p>Nano Banana Pro's image-generation performance seems to be driving more people to use the Gemini app, and it isn't the first time.

At the time, the Gemini VP added Nano Banana edited more than 200 million images in just over a week of availability.</p><p>Now, Nano Banana Pro is following in Nano Banana's footsteps, marking an even bigger milestone with over a billion edits and generations. This is impressive in and of itself, but it's even better for Google considering the wider context of AI image editing today. As competitors find themselves in scandal, Gemini's Nano Banana is emerging as a fan-favorite image generator that is squeaky clean.</p><h2 id="google-s-noncontroversial-image-generator-is-standing-out-2">Google's noncontroversial image generator is standing out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Squ3rMCQoXoZ8ftoHTkBxb" name="Gemini-3-6" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Squ3rMCQoXoZ8ftoHTkBxb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Generative AI has been used for nefarious purposes for years, but the average person and global governments are finally understanding the scope of AI image generations and deepfakes, thanks to Grok, Elon Musk's AI chatbot. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/elon-musks-xai-is-paying-telegram-usd300-million-to-integrate-grok-ai">Grok</a> powers image generation in the X (formerly Twitter) app via xAI and makes it easy to create and edit images on X, sometimes of others and of an explicit nature, by simply replying to a post and tagging the AI bot.</p><p>Grok's behavior is nothing new, as the technology has been available on underground sites before.

The company's guardrails for Gemini image generation, once criticized as being too restrictive, now stand out as potentially the gold standard for reigning in AI bots. Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/policy-guidelines/" target="_blank">policy guidelines for the Gemini app</a> prevent Gemini from generating outputs containing violence, gore, explicit material, threats to child safety, harassment, and more.</p><p>Beyond including the necessary training limits, Google is showing off how Nano Banana Pro can benefit users by being a workplace and learning tool. It can generate custom explainers in Google Search's AI Mode, create charts or infographics in NotebookLM, or diagrams in Google Slides, for example. Nano Banana Pro is also available in Google Vids and Flow.</p><p>Crucially, Google watermarks Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro generations and edits. Anyone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-can-now-tell-you-whether-a-video-was-generated-with-google-ai">check if an image (or video, for that matter) was generated with Google AI</a> by uploading it to Gemini and asking.</p><p>Google is winning in the AI image generation space on merit, offering a tool consumers want to use, as evidenced by Nano Banana Pro generating over a billion images in under two months. Perhaps more important is that Google isn't compromising principles to win the AI race. Google's image-generation models aim to be safe and transparent at a time when competitors look to be doing the exact opposite.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These components are critical to smartphones, with DRAM used for RAM and NAND used for storage.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/CYBERPOWERPC/status/1993126805658911041">CyberPowerPC</a>, global memory prices have surged by as much as 500%, while SSD prices are up nearly 100%, with no immediate signs of cooling down. If these increases were temporary, brands could have absorbed the costs and waited for prices to normalize.</p><p>However, that does not appear to be the case, meaning the higher costs are now likely to be passed on to consumers.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/getpeid/status/2011264565598912657">Pei took to X</a> to say that smartphone prices, including Nothing's own devices, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-why-your-next-phone-will-cost-more">will increase in 2026</a>. He noted that the industry has long operated under the assumption that smartphone components would inevitably become cheaper over time, but that assumption no longer holds true.</p><h2 id="why-smartphone-prices-will-increase-in-2026-2">Why smartphone prices will increase in 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SLExDmBSVbqsgXmho6v3zA" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Pro-Phone-2-vs-2" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SLExDmBSVbqsgXmho6v3zA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Much of the increase is driven by competition for the same memory components used in AI data centers. As smartphones and AI infrastructure now compete directly for DRAM and NAND supply, prices have risen sharply as a result.</p><p>Pei added that memory costs have already increased by up to three times and are quickly becoming one of the most expensive components in a smartphone. This has significantly raised the bill of materials for manufacturers, with some estimates suggesting memory modules that cost under $20 a year ago could exceed $100 by the end of the year for top-tier devices.</p><p>As a result, your next smartphone is likely to be more expensive than it otherwise would have been. Pei also confirmed that prices across Nothing's smartphone portfolio will "inevitably" increase, partly because some devices launching in Q1 2026 will move to faster UFS 3.1 storage.</p><p>While this may not be entirely surprising coming from Pei, Nothing is one of the first major Android brands to publicly confirm that smartphone prices will rise in 2026.</p><p>In other news, Samsung has reportedly been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-price-is-reportedly-stuck-in-limbo-thanks-to-rising-memory-costs">considering price increases</a> for the upcoming Galaxy S26 series, although there is no official confirmation yet. The Galaxy S26 series is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-launch-date-reliable-leaker-confirms">expected to launch on February 25</a>, 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The patch, as detailed on Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">Security Updates</a> page, contains 21 fixes for these devices. Among these, 19 are marked as "High" priority fixes, while two settle for the "Critical" tag.</p><p>Samsung states it's rolling out a fix for CVE-2026-20969, which concerns an issue where attackers could inappropriately "access file with system privileges." Other fixes were included to fix vulnerabilities with attackers accessing out-of-bounds memory, a bypass for Carrier Relock, and more.</p><p>In actuality, as SamMobile notes, the entire patch holds roughly 55 fixes for Samsung's latest flagship models. As always, Google's side holds a bit more, as per its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2026/2026-01-01">Android Security Bulletin</a>. Google detailed one critical fix en route for devices with Dolby components.</p><p>The post highlights that the January patch bears vBYLR. Users should know that the patch is slowly making its rounds in South Korea. It's not out of the norm, but users should likely prepare to see the patch hit the U.S., Europe, and other areas late this week, if not the week after.</p><h2 id="prepare-for-more-updates-2">Prepare for more updates</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-android-logo" alt="The "Powered by Android" screen that appears when booting up a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As previously stated, this is the second January patch that Samsung has rolled out for the Galaxy S25 series; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-3-lands-on-galaxy-s25-with-bug-fixes-and-january-security-patch">the first was for One UI 8.5 Beta testers</a>. A few days after New Year's, Samsung pushed a patch to its beta testers for its 8.5 Beta 3. The update was a massive 1.2GB download for users, further strengthening its enormous number of fixes for bugs. Among them, Samsung aimed to fix lock screen glitches, gallery lag, widget bugs, and much more.</p><p>The One UI 8.5 beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-reportedly-delayed">started a little later</a> than previously expected, likely due to issues Samsung had with its S26 series. The company was reportedly busy trying to narrow down the devices it wanted to offer consumers in 2026, which seems to be the S26, S26 Plus, and an S26 Ultra, per usual.</p><p>As you'd expect, this updated software is positioned as a much grander update, nothing like a smaller 8.1 update. Rumors suggest that this update will arrive alongside the Galaxy S26 series before rolling out to other models, like the S25.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We’re getting an early peek at the software that may make this all possible.</p><p>A Reddit user seems to have spotted the companion app for Google's smart glasses.  They managed to snag it by running the Android Studio preview release and setting the API to Canary preview.

After continuously being called out by the community, the company announced its "2026 Service Improvement Plan," which starts with the AYANEO Pocket Play Kickstarter campaign being temporarily paused.</p><p>As outlined on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ayaneo/comments/1qa8t1j/ayaneo_2026_service_improvement_plan/" target="_blank">r/ayaneo subreddit</a> and in a corresponding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ayaneo.com/article/911" target="_blank">blog post</a>, AYANEO's Service Improvement Plan is comprised of five different categories. These include the likes of "Shipping & Crowdfunding," along with the "After-Sales Experience." Within the plan, there are various targets and tasks, such as the new "<em>help@ayaneo.com</em>" email address, a "repair guarantee," and even plans to launch an "overseas warehouse."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2376px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:134.22%;"><img id="U23GgFHWYgsPC9KsZWDFEi" name="ayaneo-service-improvement-plan-graphic" alt="AYANEO 2026 Service Improvement Plan graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U23GgFHWYgsPC9KsZWDFEi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2376" height="3189" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For years, AYANEO and other Chinese-based gaming handheld manufacturers have relied on the likes of Kickstarter and Indiegogo as to fund its various products. The way it works is that essentially a product is announced, the campaign is opened, money is received, and the devices are shipped after the campaign reaches its goal and production begins. However, AYANEO has been treating Indiegogo more like a traditional storefront, with the campaigns reaching its goals almost instantly, mostly due to low goals being set.</p><p>The problem is that some are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/android-gaming-handhelds-are-awesome-but-theres-an-ugly-side-to-the-space-that-im-tired-of-ignoring">waiting months and months</a> to receive a device from AYANEO directly, while others are able to head over to AliExpress or even Best Buy and get one much sooner. One such example is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneos-konkr-pocket-fit-elite-could-set-the-bar-for-android-gaming-handhelds">KONKR Pocket FIT</a>, which was announced in July 2025. Despite a successful campaign, AYANEO has still yet to fulfill all of the orders from backers, while some (including myself) have been able to order one via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/pocket-fit-gaming-handheld-g3-gen3-8gb-ram-128gb-storage/CZTW4GQ2LP/sku/11441747">Best Buy</a> and have it delivered in less than a week. On the flip side, I backed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ds-is-the-worlds-first-dual-screen-android-handheld">AYANEO Pocket DS: Retro Power Edition</a> in August 2025, but only just this week received a tracking number.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="BD4RHnMFKuDM6MFJahXSXZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-render-retro-gray-3" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BD4RHnMFKuDM6MFJahXSXZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3584" height="2014" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just today (January 13), an update was posted to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/konkr/pocket-fit-premier-hi-performance-android-handheld/updates/13" target="_blank">IGG campaign</a>, stating that "only 128 units of Pocket FIT G3 remain unshipped" while "a few hundred pre-orders" from the website remain unfulfilled. Not only that, but the Pocket FIT was expected to be arrive around the same time as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-3-is-the-first-snapdragon-8-elite-handheld-starting-at-just-usd299">Odin 3</a>, making it one of just two handhelds powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Unfortunately, that model has been removed entirely, with current shipments now expected to commence "within March."</p><p>Ultimately, this has been a problem in the space for some time, but with AYANEO specifically, it wasn't until creators within the community became more vocal. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/P9FGaj8Jfxg?si=Oi-HYXRd9M4-Y--_" target="_blank">Zu Reviews from Retro Handhelds</a> was one of the first, with Russ from Retro Game Corps following suit in both his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/CImhz8sVEy8?si=kTBNx9m2ba_857Ji" target="_blank">Pocket Vert review</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxPkCrbgsSiVJTKSmLI2rz7cGetxGF8oRi?si=wiiHzcPjfW40uC5c" target="_blank">YouTube Community post</a>. Others, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ayaneo/comments/1q6mp4d/why_i_am_stopping_my_ayaneo_reviews_a_matter_of/" target="_blank">Kei's Retro Gaming</a> have also voiced their issues and concerns on the matter, effectively "putting the pressure" on AYANEO to make drastic and meaningful changes.</p><p>Although there are some who will claim they've always called out AYANEO for its practices, it's really amounted to nothing until more creators and community members united together. Regardless of why, what's clear now is that the company is finally ready to make changes. Now, we just have to hope AYANEO follows through on the plan it outlined, and that this doesn't just end up as being a bunch of smoke and mirrors.</p> ]]></dc:content>
