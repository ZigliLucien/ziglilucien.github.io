The company has announced that it's testing AI-powered smart glasses specifically developed for its delivery associates.</p><p>In a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/smart-glasses-amazon-delivery-drivers?ref=uploadvr.com&tag=upload01-20">blog post</a>, Amazon revealed that these glasses, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> that are for all users, are designed to support delivery associates to make deliveries "safer and more seamless." According to Amazon, they allow associates to scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery — all without using their phones.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> are equipped with cameras, computer vision, and AI-powered sensing capabilities. The feature has a fixed green monochrome heads-up display that shows the package details to the delivery associate directly in their field of view.</p><h2 id="amazon-s-ai-glasses-aim-to-ease-delivery-work-2">Amazon's AI glasses aim to ease delivery work</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TnJy4t4BzU4R7s9kTWAVhU" name="amazon-smart-delivery-glasses" alt="Amazon's AI smart glasses for Delivery Associates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnJy4t4BzU4R7s9kTWAVhU.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When a delivery driver parks, the glasses automatically activate and display package details, helping them locate the correct parcel in their vehicles to the corresponding homes. After that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/level-up-your-tech-game-with-20-percent-off-these-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> then show turn-by-turn navigation to guide the delivery partner to the exact location.</p><p>The glasses are operated by a small controller worn in the delivery vest and powered by a swappable battery for "all-day use." Amazon also says the glasses support prescription lenses and ones that automatically adjust to surrounding light.</p><p>The company adds that it has tested earlier versions of the smart glasses with delivery partners to collect crucial feedback and improve the design. It also mentioned that a "future version" may detect issues — such as if a package is dropped at the wrong doorstep — and even notify the partner if there's a pet in the yard.</p><p>For now, Amazon hasn't revealed when it will fully deploy these smart glasses across its delivery fleet, but a previous report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/amazon-reportedly-working-on-echo-hud-glasses/">The Information</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/amazon-building-hud-glasses-for-delivery-drivers/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=threads">UploadVR</a>) suggested that Amazon plans to roll out driver glasses by mid-2026, with an initial production of about 100,000 units.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google is finally making that process easier by selling replacement earbuds, eartips, and charging cases for the Pixel Buds directly through its online store.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/22/pixel-buds-2a-pro-2-replacement/">9to5Google</a>, the Google Store now lists replacement parts for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a>. That means if you misplace one earbud, drop it in water, or your case starts malfunctioning, you can now buy those specific parts directly from Google without having to go through support.</p><p>Previously, users had to go through a lengthy self-service repair process on Google's website to order replacement parts, which often took days and involved multiple steps. Now, you can simply go to the online store, choose the part you need, and buy it straight away.</p><p>For the Pixel Buds Pro 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_pro_2_earbuds?hl=en-US">replacement earbuds</a> cost $70, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_pro_2_case?hl=en-US">charging case</a> costs $95. They're available in Porcelain, Hazel, Wintergreen, and Peony, though the new Moonstone color is currently unavailable. For the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a>, both the earbuds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_2a_case?hl=en-US">case</a> cost $55 each, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_2a_eartip_set?hl=en-US">replacement eartips</a> for both earbuds are priced at $20.</p><h2 id="replacement-parts-are-now-just-a-click-away-2">Replacement parts are now just a click away</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8cuHCkWQym8z8oUxEvr6WQ" name="pixel-buds-replacement-parts" alt="Replacement Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 parts on Google Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8cuHCkWQym8z8oUxEvr6WQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google notes that replacements may not always be available in all regions or at all times. At the time of writing, eartips for the Pixel Buds 2a are already out of stock. It's worth noting that at the time of purchasing, you can also specify whether you want the left or right earbud replaced.</p><p>This move aligns with Google's growing emphasis on repairability and sustainability across its product lineup. The company recently highlighted that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> are easier to repair than ever before and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/get-pixel-repaired-half-price-oct-2025">hosted a repair education session</a> at its New York store last week to promote the effort.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-2a-review">Pixel Buds 2a</a>, Google has also made it possible to replace the charging case battery, something that wasn't possible with the previous generation Pixel Buds. And now, replacement parts are available for the rest of the earbuds too — though you might want to wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, where a full pair of Pixel Buds might cost nearly the same as these replacement parts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5224477353054299" target="_blank">Ice Universe on Weibo</a> (translated) says "the release of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series has been postponed." There are no other details in the post explaining a potential cause for the holdups, or when the lineup might now release.</p><p>The post, first shared on Tuesday, Oct. 22, came just minutes after the leaker Instant Digital also shared news of the rumored Galaxy S26 delay <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5224475520925890" target="_blank">on Weibo</a> (translated): "In order to present it better to everyone, the release of the Galaxy S26 series may be postponed to March for release."</p><p>As the Galaxy S26 is still in the rumor phase and Samsung hasn't confirmed anything yet, we don't officially know when its next lineup of flagship phones might release. The Samsung Galaxy S25 was announced in January 2025 and became generally available for purchase the following month. If these two leakers' claims about a Galaxy S26 delay pan out, we could be looking at a February 2026 or March 2026 launch.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-the-first-rumor-alleging-a-galaxy-s26-shakeup-2">It's not the first rumor alleging a Galaxy S26 shakeup</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sbmar9v2hHx2DxaATYpNyT" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-S25-Plus-and-S25-back-03" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, and Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sbmar9v2hHx2DxaATYpNyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If the Samsung Galaxy S26 series ends up being delayed, we likely won't know the root cause for certain. However, other rumors related to the Samsung launch seem to paint the picture that things aren't going as planned. The company was tipped to be prepping a lineup including the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>With a few months to go before the phones' expected launch window, the rumors have completely flipped. Samsung is now thought to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">canceling the Galaxy S26 Edge entirely</a> in favor of the Galaxy S26 Plus. Soon after, leaks rolled in claiming the Galaxy S26 Pro would not be branded as "Pro," and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/-may-not-be-an-s26-pro-either">instead stick to basics as the Galaxy S26</a>.</p><p>With key details reportedly up in the air, it might not come as a surprise that Samsung is rumored to be delaying the Galaxy S26 launch. Still, we'll have to wait and see whether these rumors turn out to be true.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The upgrade is seemingly designed to give the Pixel's AOD a little more smarts when it comes to whether or not the user is around to interact with it.</p><p>Rahman states that the newest Canary build features a new string with the following on-device description: "power down the display when no user activity is detected to save power."</p><p>As Rahman reiterates, Google Pixels already turn off the AOD if your phone is in your pocket or if flipped over (screen down). What "activity" could mean in this case could involve a couple of things. As Rahman mentions, perhaps the Pixel's proximity sensor could come into greater effect here, to determine if the user is near their phone and moving around, or whatever the case may be. Moreover, tracking the user's "activity" could also mean whether or not they've picked up their device to check a notification or not in a while.</p><p>There's no hiding the fact that the AOD can severely drain your battery, which is why Google is supposedly working on this new option. If users left the room, but left their Pixel's AOD on for a while, it'll shut off, saving them from returning to a nearly dead phone.</p><h2 id="refining-the-pixel-2">Refining the Pixel</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-11" alt="A white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL on a latticework black chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google revealed its Android Canary channel during the summer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-canary-release-channel-devs-rigorous-testing-pixels">as an avenue for developers</a> to step into the core of its API development.

The back of the tablet is made out of polycarbonate, and while I would've preferred metal, I didn't see any problems with build quality. And at 508g, the tablet isn't so heavy that it's uncomfortable to hold, and I had no problems in regular use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="K8BitT3STG5QLE7GUWPU4N" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8BitT3STG5QLE7GUWPU4N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The front camera is integrated into the bezel, and honestly, it isn't even visible in regular use — it's only when you squint right at it that you can make out that it's there. The camera quality is decent enough, although admittedly I only use it while attending briefings. Interestingly, you get two cameras at the back — a 50MP main lens and 8MP wide-angle — and as a result, the rear camera module is bigger than most other tablets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mMTGmuKgDXgeVdWsQ9b53N" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mMTGmuKgDXgeVdWsQ9b53N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A tablet needs good accessories, and the reason why I'm now using the Xiaomi Pad Mini to control my smart home is because of the custom case and stylus. Huawei does a great job in this area, and the MatePad Pro 12.2-inch comes with a keyboard and stylus as standard. The Glide Keyboard connects using Huawei's NearLink protocol, and it has a cubby to store the stylus. On that note, Huawei doesn't bundle the M-Pencil 3 stylus, but sells it as a free add-on when you buy the tablet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5076px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="EBSUXipKVVpq9Jib2XD2wM" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EBSUXipKVVpq9Jib2XD2wM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5076" height="2859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The keyboard is great to use; the keys have good travel, you get a large touchpad, and it doesn't add much bulk to the tablet as a whole.

While there isn't a charger bundled with the tablet, it uses Huawei's 100W standard, and it takes just over an hour to charge the battery.</p><h2 id="no-google-no-problem-2">No Google, no problem</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gWBQ85E8y4aYtzenQ2yULN" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gWBQ85E8y4aYtzenQ2yULN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's the software where things diverge from traditional Android tablets. The MatePad Pro doesn't have Google Mobile Services, so you don't get the Play Store, Gmail, Chrome, or YouTube pre-installed. While that is annoying, it's extremely easy to get these apps installed via GBox — doing so takes under five minutes. Once they're installed, they're sandboxed within GBox, but I didn't see any difference in usability.</p><p>The tablet runs HarmonyOS 4.3 out of the box, and it is similar enough to EMUI that there isn't a learning curve.

Rolling out today, users can "set a daily limit" for how long the YouTube app on mobile will allow them to scroll through Shorts. The post states this option will appear in the app's Settings once the update arrives.</p><p>YouTube says that once users reach their daily limit, the app will inform them via a "dismissible" notification indicating their Shorts feed will be "paused" until the following day.</p><p>Users can look at this as a sort of "digital wellbeing" update for YouTube's Shorts, as the post highlights the intent behind encouraging better viewing habits/time management. While older users can utilize this to help manage themselves, YouTube says it will bring this to parents "later this year."</p><p>When this update arrives, parents will be able to set a daily limit on Shorts viewing for kid and teen accounts that they supervise. However, the main difference here is that the alerts for younger users will be "non-dismissible." Parents will be able to activate and set a daily limit for their children at will, and disable it, if desired, all the same.</p><h2 id="shorts-are-popular-2">Shorts are popular</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oU5namDbUAVCZENPFa4Wrf" name="YouTube-Shorts-hero.jpg" alt="YouTube Shorts logo on a mobile phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oU5namDbUAVCZENPFa4Wrf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6016" height="3384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it's up to the user to decide whether or not they need a "daily limit," it's clear that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-shorts-five-trillion-total-views">YouTube's Shorts are extremely popular</a>. Less than two years after the platform debuted its short-form content, it reported that Shorts had already surpassed five trillion views. This number was achieved across multiple platforms, such as Android phones and laptops.</p><p>While Shorts proved quite popular, YouTube was already looking into ways to help short-form content creators gain more revenue.</p><p>On a related note, it also sought ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-starts-rolling-out-shoppable-video-ads-worldwide">push the shopping experience</a> to people watching Shorts. These videos gained shoppable ads, designed to help advertisers bring their product closer to viewers, in an attempt to, of course, get them to buy that new dress or shirt or pair of shoes.

A Pixel 8 owner from Germany chimed in, reporting similar problems.</p><p>Spotify has offered that users can cleanly reinstall the app on their devices, but that hasn't reportedly helped. The main culprit seems to be that, when connected to Wi-Fi, the Spotify app is crashing on Galaxy and Pixel devices.

The post states that this week, owners of a 2025 Samsung TV will find the new Perplexity AI app available on their set. As an incentive, Perplexity is offering a 12-month subscription to its Pro plan for free after scanning the QR code in the app.</p><p>Samsung states the Perplexity AI app for its TVs is the first of its kind, seeking to deliver "smart, generative AI support to the largest communal screens."</p><p>Ryan Foutty, vice president of business at Perplexity, states, "Curiosity can strike at any time. Perplexity’s mission is to serve the world’s curiosity by bridging the gap between traditional search and innovative AI-driven interfaces." In the name of "curiosity," the Perplexity AI app on Samsung's TVs can reportedly help viewers with queries ranging from simple questions to new shows they might enjoy.</p><p>The post states users can get specific, asking Perplexity AI about "movies directed by the Russo Brothers." Additionally, you can ask the AI to help you plan a trip, if you'd like, without reaching for your phone.</p><h2 id="the-tv-is-the-place-to-be-2">The TV is the place to be</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="6JQ4RhxgmSQGi3mDW3YyhG" name="samsung-tv-perplexity-ai-launch" alt="Samsung and Perplexity join hands to bring a Perplexity AI app for the 2025 TV experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6JQ4RhxgmSQGi3mDW3YyhG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Perplexity AI app should be available on your 2025 Samsung TV home screen. Samsung says you can navigate to the Apps Tab to find it and, if it isn't there, check the Vision AI companion (press the AI Button on your remote). Users can agree to let the AI access their remote microphone, or they can use the on-screen keyboard.</p><p>While only this year's TVs from Samsung get in the fun, that won't last long, as the brand's 2023 and 2024 and set to receive the app, too. However, consumers with TVs from the past two generations will have to wait for an OS upgrade set for "later this year."</p><p>Samsung's been looking to enhance the TV experience since the year started, as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/google-samsung-come-together-to-introduce-eclipsa-audio">announced a partnership with Google</a> for spatial audio. The two companies stated earlier this year that they were working to create an open-source spatial audio format called "Eclipsa Audio." The purpose of this format was to bring this technology reliably to more people, as well as creators.</p><p>Samsung was preparing to bring it to its consumers later this year (around Q3/Q4) on its TVs, soundbars, while Google sought to expand it to Chrome browsers and YouTube videos.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This particular deal is for the 512GB storage version of the device, and for the Pantone Scarab color. Still, Best Buy is offering slightly reduced discounts of $100-$200 off for the Pantone Mountain Trail and Pantone Rio Red colors, if you prefer those and don't mind spending a little more.</p><p>The Razr Ultra is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones#section-best-foldable">best foldable Motorola phone </a>on the market, and in no small part due to its super functional cover screen, its long-lasting battery, its sturdy build, and its powerful performance with a wide range of AI features.

However, if that isn't a dealbreaker for you, $900 or $1,000 is a pretty solid price on this phone, so it's definitely worth considering.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And while those are all phenomenal reasons to get a Galaxy XR this year, the real “secret sauce” is the software platform that powers everything.</p><p>That's because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, the operating system running the show, does several things better than any OS before it. Google has taken its time to learn from the mistakes Meta and Apple have made thus far and has designed a brand new version of Android that's changing the paradigm for how an XR headset works.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

Since the beginning, the Meta Quest family of devices has primarily been gaming consoles, with apps and non-gaming applications coming second. Meta tried to convince developers that porting their Android apps over to the Quest would be a worthwhile venture, but 99% of Android developers simply didn't answer the call.</p><p>Apple tried to prevent this by building the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Vision Pro</a> to support iOS apps, but the company made a vital mistake in this implementation: it allowed developers to <em>opt out</em> of support for Vision Pro even though iOS apps can run just fine on the headset. This meant thousands of apps haven't supported the headset from day one.</p><p>But Google and Samsung are doing things differently. <em>Every single</em> Google Play app works on Galaxy XR from day one, meaning there's no need for developers to do anything to make their apps work on the headset. That also means that, unlike with Vision Pro, Galaxy XR buyers don't have to worry about their favorite apps likely never making their way to Samsung's headset. They're all there, and they work gloriously.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf" name="Android-XR-infinite-desktop" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some apps have even received substantial built-for-XR upgrades, like Google Maps, YouTube, Google Meet, Chrome, Calm, Fox Sports, MLB, HBO Max, Netflix, and more.</p><p>To help find and juggle all those apps, Google has built Android XR with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> integration from day one. This doesn't just mean the usual AI stuff we've become accustomed to on our phones; it means wholly new paradigms of app interaction.</p><p>So while you certainly can say “Hey Google, open Maps” or something equally pedestrian, Gemini is built to actually <em>interact</em> with the apps and windows on your screen and anything you see through the Galaxy XR’s high-resolution external cameras. So if you've got a bunch of apps open on your headset and are getting overwhelmed, you can ask Gemini to organize the windows, and it'll intelligently arrange them <strong>instantly</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nxuFMJF3BJrHA62DcyLxTf" name="Android-XR-circle-to-search-chrome" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating Chrome screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room.

I'm not saying you should use this to do your homework, but if companies are trying to convince people to do their jobs using AI, why not homework, too?</p><p>Apple may have pioneered eye-tracking-based UI navigation, but Google's brilliant implementation of Gemini to act more like a virtual secretary (or even a maid) means you can sit back and relax more often and enjoy all of the great things Galaxy XR has to offer. These two big things — apps and Gemini — have transformed the entire XR experience and made it feel like a profound new way to do all of the things you love.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung isn't positioning this as a gaming console the way Meta is, but the headset still features several popular VR games and is slated to get a whole lot more.

XR is smartly using a rigid strap similar to the Meta Quest Pro instead of the uncomfortable cloth strap used on the Apple Vision Pro. This helps better distribute weight and provide stability across your head, complete with a nice thick pad along the back of the cranium.</p><p>The strap's size can be quickly adjusted via a dial on the back, similar to Meta Quest Pro or the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Meta Quest 3 accessories</a>. A generous forehead pad keeps all the weight spaced out between the user's forehead and the cushion on the back of the head for maximum comfort.</p><p>That also means there's no weight placed on a user's face at all, a significant improvement to Apple's face-heavy design. Samsung is keeping the battery as a tethered accessory instead of packing it into the headset, ensuring that it weighs as little as possible. Thankfully, you can charge the battery pack while using the headset, potentially adding unlimited time to the estimated 2.5-hour battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qTQnUuowCKwjxbCTzqzvnM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-with-case-and-controllers" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, carrying case, and controllers sitting on four separate plastic pedestals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qTQnUuowCKwjxbCTzqzvnM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Hidden behind the gorgeous glass front is a set of six tracking cameras, two high-resolution passthrough cameras, one depth sensor, and one flicker sensor.

Mixed-reality passthrough will enable apps that sit on virtual screens within your real living room, letting you see the world around you while still using virtual apps. It's all powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR</a>,  a new version of Android that Google says is "the first Android platform built entirely for the Gemini era."</p><p>This means that the entire UI can be controlled via multimodal input, including eye tracking, hand tracking, controllers, and voice input. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> has full power over the experience and can do virtually anything you need it to do, helping to change the paradigm of how we interact with mixed-reality apps. You can even ask Gemini to organize the windows of apps you have running, making it a very powerful organizational tool.</p><p>When Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p9BtBd-Al8">revealed it on stage</a>, the company said, "You can talk to your device as if you were talking to someone in the physical world." This is because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini can see what you see and hear what you hear</a>, including using the cameras on the headset to help identify things around you. This means you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">circle to search</a> for things using your hands, so it's easy to find great cooking recipes and cook hands-free, for example.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google's XR OS could take a similar approach to VisionOS.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a surprise move, Google confirmed that <em>all</em> Android apps on the Google Play Store will work on Galaxy XR from day one. That's a massive leg-up on both Apple and Meta, as it means all your favorite apps already work on Samsung's new headset.</p><p>Google touts many of its apps running on Galaxy XR, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and others. The headset works for both entertainment and productivity thanks to its hardware design, which allows for high-quality immersive and mixed-reality experiences alike.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0AyzvfTRLo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Apps like YouTube can be run in a floating window or in fully immersive theater mode. Better yet, the headset is capable of enhancing 2D videos by adding a convincing layer of 3D depth using onboard AI. In our hands-on, Michael Hicks noted that "while Galaxy XR's hardware is impressive, I wouldn't be as excited for the headset if it weren't for unique Android XR tricks like this."</p><p>While browsing the web, you can pull Chrome tabs off the main window and place them in a floating window, giving you "unlimited monitors" to work on, no matter where you're working from.</p><p>Beyond comparisons to existing headsets, Google hopes to pave a new way to the future through communication with Gemini. Since Gemini can see and hear everything in the real <em>and</em> virtual worlds, it has a significant advantage over Apple's Siri in the Vision Pro and Meta AI in the Quest 3.</p><p>This allows you to have a conversation with Google about what's happening in any app you're using, as well as the room around you, melding the two together in a way that we simply have not seen before.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_r8MV0GkQE?start=207" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google showed off a brief Gemini on Android XR showcase during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/the-android-show-i-o-special-live-blog-everything-coming-to-android-16">The Android Show</a> on May 13, 2025. This particular demo showed off how Gemini can be used to search for information, but it doesn't work exactly like you're used to. Instead of just pulling up the search results on a single browser tab, Gemini can open multiple applications at a time and give you extensive information with a single query.</p><p>In the example, the person was researching vacation options and Gemini was able to pull up Google Maps, YouTube videos, and even assemble a draft itinerary in Google Docs, all on "the infinite screen," as the presenter called it. This lets you "create an itinerary in minutes" with tons of useful information at your fingertips instead of needing to cycle through multiple apps on a tiny phone screen.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b2ccf917-5bec-4204-85f6-a8c63b1fcc3b">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/xr/galaxy-xr/galaxy-xr/buy/galaxy-xr-256gb-silver-shadow-wi-fi-sm-i610nzsaxar/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy XR" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:66.67%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uv5zjFjU6iH7kRCMd7VmjS.jpg' alt="Galaxy XR front view"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy XR</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The most cutting-edge XR headset ever made is here, and it runs all Google Play apps in a new version of Android called Android XR.

In the future, this could be a thing of the past. You could theoretically say “Hey Google, can you plan out my dinner tonight and send me a shopping list of things I need to get. Then book an Uber for 5 pm, so I can go get supplies right after my Pilates class.”</p><p>Whatever device is near you would pick up on your request and make it happen, with very little interaction from you. Basically, AI will be more than just the apps on your phone; it will be the driving force behind how you interact with your devices.</p><p>We’ve seen examples of this already; Motorola showed off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">Large Action Model</a>, which takes what it knows about you and performs actions with little to no involvement from you —ordering your favorite beverage from a local shop you frequent, for example. Google has also enabled more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-shopping-highlights-upgraded-ai-clothing-makeup">agentic capabilities within products like Chrome</a> that lets it work in the background to complete certain tasks like shopping for groceries.</p><div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/MainVid_InstaCart_1.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/MainVid_InstaCart_1.mp4"></video></div><p>Qualcomm recently shared a vision of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-and-qualcomm-finally-realize-what-ai-is-for">what an agentic and interconnected future looks like</a>, moving seamlessly from one device to another through AI, and we’re getting closer to that future. This means that no matter what device you use, what AI service you interact with, AI will be more accessible to consumers.</p><p>And while today's consumers aren’t necessarily buying phones for just the AI, companies are becoming aware that a growing number of consumers want AI that can actually help them and make their lives easier. Google has demonstrated as much with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10</a>. If you look at any Pixel 10 ad, you will notice that the focus is on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a> and how it helps users. Almost nothing is said about the actual phone. This shows that AI is slowly but surely becoming a driving force that will shape consumer spending.</p><p>Here’s IDC’s exclusive take on how AI will shape the future of technology.</p><p><strong>— Shruti Shekar, Editor in Chief</strong></p><p><strong>— Derrek Lee, Managing Editor</strong></p><h2 id="ai-in-the-mobile-world-where-we-are-and-where-we-re-headed-2">AI in the mobile world: Where we are and where we’re headed</h2><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been quietly shaping the smartphone experience for years. From computational photography to natural language processing, AI has long been embedded in our mobile lives—enhancing photos, powering voice assistants, and optimizing performance. But the recent rise of Generative AI (GenAI) marks a new chapter that promises to redefine how we interact with our devices, and even how we choose them.</p><h2 id="ai-s-quiet-beginnings-in-mobile-2">AI’s quiet beginnings in mobile</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="E2Ym3FmaJDtZHuz8fKJLvk" name="Google-Pixel-Call-Screen.jpg" alt="Phone call being screened on a Pixel phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E2Ym3FmaJDtZHuz8fKJLvk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before GenAI and now Agentic AI became buzzwords, AI in smartphones was largely invisible to the average user. It worked behind the scenes — improving battery life, enhancing camera performance, and enabling smarter voice interactions. These features were valuable, but rarely marketed as “AI-powered.” Instead, they were sold as better user experiences.</p><p>This changed roughly two years ago when GenAI began appearing in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium smartphones</a>. With capabilities like real-time image editing, personalized content creation, and advanced voice interactions, oftentimes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a>, low-latency processing. GenAI brought AI to the forefront, but its reach was limited.</p><p>According to IDC’s Spring 2025 U.S. consumer survey, only 10.9% of respondents said they owned an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-ai-phones">AI smartphone</a>. This is unsurprising given that GenAI was mostly confined to flagship devices. However, it does indicate that the runway for growth is long.</p><h2 id="consumer-interest-is-building-2">Consumer interest is building</h2><p>IDC’s survey also asked those who didn’t own an AI smartphone about their interest in the category. The results were telling: 47.1% said they would consider purchasing one in the future. That's a strong indicator for adoption later on, especially as consumers tend to replace their smartphones once every 3 to 5 years.</p><p>In another 2025 IDC survey from Asia Pacific, 63.5% of respondents said that AI features were somewhat important/very important when purchasing a smartphone, once again underscoring stronger-than-average future interest. However, against the backdrop of other feature considerations, AI took a back seat behind price, brand, and user friendliness.</p><p>Historically, these have been the leading factors when deciding on a new smartphone and have not changed even with the advent of AI. Meanwhile, AI finished outside of the top five most important features.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-XbeLZag-k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>This leads us to believe that AI is a tough sell when marketed as a concept, for now. AI in smartphones isn’t a raw spec, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">a suite of intelligent features</a> to provide a superior user experience. Consumers don’t walk into stores asking for an “AI phone.” Rather, they do ask for AI-powered features.</p><p>Take Google Pixel’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, for example. It allows users to remove unwanted objects from photos with a tap. It’s a clear, tangible benefit powered by AI, and consumers ask for such features when purchasing new devices. From PCs to mobile phones, a number of users are using AI-powered features such as chatbots, AI assistants, photo/video editing, writing/editing content, translation, and so on.</p><p>It's features like these that propel the market. By the end of 2025, IDC expects vendors to ship over 370 million GenAI-enabled smartphones worldwide, a 62.5% increase from the nearly 230 million shipped last year, and this grows further in 2026, with volumes surpassing 500 million. This surge means AI is moving beyond premium devices and into the mainstream.</p><h2 id="business-models-will-be-forced-to-evolve-2">Business models will be forced to evolve </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="j4MyfKY3AaBwbdhzX2doN3" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-24" alt="Perplexity on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j4MyfKY3AaBwbdhzX2doN3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To support this shift, business models will also need to evolve. Today, many phones are subsidized through pre-installed apps such as bloatware from telcos, third-party app stores, and apps or offers for cloud services. But as AI changes how users interact with their phones, these models may become obsolete.</p><p>We've all seen examples where you ask AI to plan a trip and it handles everything, including booking flights, hotels, creating itineraries, and sending calendar invites, all without opening a single app. But this raises a key question: which services does the AI choose to complete these tasks? If apps like Expedia or Airbnb aren’t installed, does the AI default to one based on user history, performance, or a behind-the-scenes partnership?</p><p>Strategic partnerships between service providers, phone makers, and AI platforms are likely to be formed, and we can expect this kind of integration to become more common over the next five years as AI matures and becomes ubiquitous across devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PZXr3PzafMr7GowoVSXZwQ" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-plus-mind-summary" alt="Looking through a summary of gym notes stored in Plus Mind in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZXr3PzafMr7GowoVSXZwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, this transition won't be easy. As AI becomes the central interface, the traditional app-based business model will face significant disruption. Today, apps and services compete for user attention and strive to own the customer experience. Many will resist handing over control to AI platforms, fearing the loss of direct engagement and brand identity, and will try to maintain their own ecosystems and monetization strategies over the next few years.</p><p>But in the long term, those that integrate best with AI will thrive as consumers often prioritize convenience and efficiency. This also positions AI as the gatekeeper as it chooses which service to use and shifts the customer relationship from the app to the AI.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2831px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CZgCCLNgjtp9wizx9HgS9U" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-Ecosystem-of-You.JPG" alt="Cristiano Amon on stage with "Ecosystem of you" on a screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CZgCCLNgjtp9wizx9HgS9U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2831" height="1593" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the platform players, AI is becoming an extension of the OS, although with various flavors of AI, there is some degree of fragmentation. Apps, services, and potentially even device makers will need to rethink how they engage users, possibly moving toward API-first models that allow AI platforms to access their services directly or by partnering with AI providers to curate unique experiences.</p><p>Those who resist may find themselves sidelined, while those who embrace AI integration will become part of the new mobile paradigm.</p><p>What's the impact on consumers? Prices of AI smartphones are expected to come down from an average selling price of $1053 in 2024 to $786 in 2026. But the AI itself won't be cheap, as all the top companies in this space are eager to monetize their investments through subscriptions, advertising, or other means.</p><p><strong>Apps to actions</strong></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5" name="Moto-AI-LAM-Starbucks-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024-5.jpg" alt="Moto AI features demonstrated on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3749" height="2109" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A decade from now, AI won’t just be a feature; it will be the primary interface across a wide range of devices. Smartphones will still play a central role, but they’ll be part of a broader ecosystem of smart glasses, headphones, wearables, and other ambient devices. Consumers will interact with the same AI across these form factors, customized and personalized for each user, choosing the most appropriate device for the task at hand or perhaps letting the AI do so.</p><p>This marks a shift from today’s app-centric experience to a task-centric one. Instead of opening individual apps to complete a task, users will simply ask their AI to “plan a trip,” “book a cab,” or “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-google-photos-ai-editing-tools">edit a photo</a>,” and the AI will orchestrate everything behind the scenes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="B9kkdUCwH7ZFJRViskGDqc" name="rabbit-r1-spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify playing on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B9kkdUCwH7ZFJRViskGDqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are early versions of this today. Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-bought-into-the-ai-hype-and-all-i-got-was-an-orange-square">Rabbit R1</a> attempted to create such interactions. But such devices and interfaces lack polish and are held back by deep integrations into the OS, apps, and services.</p><p>There are already rumors that Google is working on a more deeply integrated version of Gemini, one that could take control of apps and execute tasks on behalf of users. If true, this would be a major leap toward a unified AI experience that spans devices and services seamlessly. But it also means that Google has to rethink how it monetizes Android, and its partners need to figure out if Gemini aids or hinders their own business models.</p><p>In this future, the form factor becomes secondary. Whether you're wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>, using earbuds, or holding a phone, the experience will be consistent, intelligent, and personalized. The AI will know your preferences, context, and history, enabling it to act proactively and intuitively.</p><h2 id="selling-ai-through-experience-2">Selling AI through experience</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE" name="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" alt="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1584" height="891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The future of mobile AI isn’t about selling “AI phones.” It’s about selling AI-powered experiences. Consumers want features that solve problems, save time, and delight. For device vendors, the ones who can sell the AI experience, translating AI into everyday user value, will be the ones that stand out.</p><p>For the consumer, the early adoption will be led by those who can quickly grasp the features, but the next wave of adoption will be increasingly from those who prefer or need new and simpler ways to interact. As AI becomes more accessible and integrated, expect it to play a growing role in purchase decisions. But for now, the path to adoption lies in showing, not telling.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With version 16.0 and newer, both in the stable and beta builds, Google has added new toggles that let you hide the period and comma keys from the main keyboard.</p><p>You can find these options in Settings under Preferences, where each punctuation key has its own switch, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/21/gboard-period-comma-keys/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. By default, both are on, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks">Gboard</a> looks the same as usual. If you turn one or both off, the bottom row only shows the spacebar, Enter, and ?123 keys. This gives you a wider spacebar and a simpler look.</p><p>This small change has been in the works for a while, previously spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gboard-hide-punctuation-keys-apk-teardown-3539471/" target="_blank">APK teardowns</a> that hinted at Google experimenting with punctuation visibility. Now, it’s officially rolling out, marking one of the more practical customization updates to Gboard in recent memory.</p><h2 id="great-for-minimalists-tricky-for-heavy-typers-2">Great for minimalists, tricky for heavy typers</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:385px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.38%;"><img id="vdeMVxW5fdAEhqvDh4X7md" name="Gboard-period-and-comma-key-toggles" alt="Gboard toggles for period and comma" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vdeMVxW5fdAEhqvDh4X7md.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="385" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:97.89%;"><img id="558TvDbKeNQYb76KZW2Hod" name="Gboard-period-and-comma-key-toggles" alt="Gboard layout without the period and comma keys" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/558TvDbKeNQYb76KZW2Hod.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="1253" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>This update is helpful for people who prefer a cleaner keyboard or often tap punctuation keys by mistake. Still, it may not work for everyone. If you use a lot of punctuation, you might find it a bit less convenient.</p><p>Without the dedicated period key, you’ll have to rely on shortcuts like double-tapping the spacebar to insert one, or jump into the symbol menu with ?123. Unfortunately, there’s no comparable shortcut for the comma, which might frustrate heavy texters who rely on it frequently.</p><p>This feature seems to be rolling out widely and is not limited to any region or language. When you turn it off, Gboard automatically changes the spacing and layout, so you keep the same usability but get a cleaner look.</p><p>Some users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1oct4b6/gboard_now_lets_you_hide_the_period_and_comma_keys/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> like the simpler design, while others think the punctuation keys should stay visible, since not everyone wants to change settings for something so simple.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Only a few hours after the Galaxy XR headset launched, its optional controllers sold out in the U.S.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR</a> made its debut in the US and South Korea with a hefty $1,800 price tag, marking Samsung’s return to the high-end headset game. The company also offered a pair of tracked controllers for an additional $250, or $175 during a brief launch discount. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/galaxy-xr/xr-controllers-silver-shadow-sku-et-oi610bjegus/" target="_blank">option to purchase</a> them vanished from Samsung’s U.S. website <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsungs-usd1-800-galaxy-xr-is-here-to-challenge-apple">shortly after the headset went live</a>.</p><p>While it’s still possible to grab a few units in South Korea, the U.S. stock seems to be wiped out completely, and Samsung hasn’t said when more will arrive.</p><p>The situation is more than just a case of high demand for accessories. The Galaxy XR is designed to operate on its own, using a mix of hand gestures, eye-tracking, and voice commands powered by Samsung and Google’s collaborative software.</p><p>That’s great for casual mixed-reality experiences, productivity tools, or spatial apps. But for anyone hoping to dive into more immersive VR titles or PC-VR content, the lack of controllers is a serious setback since many games simply won’t work without them.</p><h2 id="strong-demand-hints-at-a-bigger-vr-appetite-than-expected-2">Strong demand hints at a bigger VR appetite than expected</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, Samsung has been clear that gaming isn’t the main focus of the Galaxy XR. Instead, it’s pitching the headset as a device built for productivity, creativity, and entertainment rather than the kind of intense VR gaming that Meta’s Quest lineup targets.</p><p>That might explain why the controllers are sold separately and weren’t bundled with the headset at launch. Still, given how quickly they sold out, it’s obvious that plenty of buyers are eager to use the Galaxy XR for more traditional VR experiences.</p><p>For now, Galaxy XR owners in the US are left with two options: wait for Samsung to restock the controllers or make do with the built-in controls until then. Either way, the rapid sell-out shows there’s strong interest in Samsung’s new mixed-reality platform, perhaps even more than the company anticipated.</p><p>If Samsung plans to expand the Galaxy XR’s availability beyond its initial two markets, it might want to ensure its accessory supply can keep up with the growing excitement.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In practice, this means conversations — including calls to landlines or older devices — will have background noise such as wind, traffic or construction filtered out, and voices on both ends will sound clearer. The feature is enabled by default, though users will have the option to disable it if they prefer.</p><p>Another major upgrade: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a>’s web interface for calls and messages gains full support for RCS (Rich Communication Services). That means users can send high-resolution photos and videos and enjoy richer threads from a browser even if their phone is not within reach. The rollout for this is expected in early December.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="jayPiHXcgWnt4HPkKCGQHe" name="Google-Fi-RCS-messaging-web-large" alt="Google Fi RCS messaging on the web" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jayPiHXcgWnt4HPkKCGQHe.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To tackle weak indoor signals, Google Fi is expanding its Wi-Fi Auto Connect+ feature. For select devices (currently Pixel 5a and newer) the service will automatically connect to premium Wi-Fi networks at no extra cost and secure the connection via VPN. This expanded capability will cover tens of millions of locations including major airports (LAX, ORD, JFK) and participating retail malls and stores. On such networks you’ll see a “W+” icon in your status bar.</p><h2 id="bills-you-can-actually-understand-2">Bills you can actually understand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fFbrXdc48XzCy6FUiQWPQk" name="Google-Fi-billing" alt="Google Fi billing summary" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fFbrXdc48XzCy6FUiQWPQk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In-app support is getting smarter too. The Google Fi app will now generate AI-powered summaries of your monthly bill: what you were charged, what changed since last month, and how any plan adjustments might affect your future costs. This aims to reduce the confusion around mobile bills and avoid needless calls to support.</p><p>To go along with the feature rollout, Google Fi is offering a limited-time promotion: new subscribers bringing their own phone and signing up for either the Unlimited Essentials or Unlimited Standard plans will receive 50% off for 15 months. The offer ends November 4, 2025.</p><p>If you’re already on Google Fi with a compatible device, the upgrades are mostly automatic and won’t cost extra. Google is weaving AI deeper into its mobile service as functional enhancements that address real frustrations: noisy calls, patchy indoor connectivity, browser-based messaging limitations, and opaque bills.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Ahead of its debut, reliable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1980752134413914183">Arsène Lupin</a> has shared that the 16GB/512GB variant of the OnePlus 15 will retail for £949 (~$1,260) in the UK.</p><p>The leaker hasn't shared the pricing details for the base 256GB variant of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> yet, or pricing for other markets like the US and India, but the leaked price for the 512GB model could indicate that OnePlus plans to lower prices this year.</p><h2 id="oneplus-might-actually-lower-flagship-prices-this-year-2">OnePlus might actually lower flagship prices this year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vKJ2HLFpiL3eQUWHFPPu5h" name="oneplus-15-showcase-qualcomm-summit" alt="OnePlus executive holding OnePlus 15 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKJ2HLFpiL3eQUWHFPPu5h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For context, the same 16GB/512GB version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> currently sells for £999 in the UK. That means if this leak is accurate, the OnePlus 15 could be £50 cheaper than its predecessor. It's unclear whether the base model's price will drop too, though the OnePlus 13's base variant launched at £899, so a small reduction could be on the table.</p><p>This potential price cut is refreshing, especially considering how other smartphone makers have gone in the opposite direction.

The brand has a new model in the range dubbed the TV Backlight 3 Pro, and the main highlight is that it gets HDR integration. That's interesting enough in its own right, so I installed the TV Backlight 3 Pro on my 75-inch TV, and used it for the better part of a month.</p><p>The TV Backlight 3 Pro is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Backlight-RGBWWIC-Supports-DreamView/dp/B0FJR9LKBQ">available on Amazon for $179</a>, and that's for the standard model designed to be used with 55 to 65-inch TVs. If you've got a larger TV, you'll need to get the 75 to 85-inch version, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Backlight-RGBWWIC-Supports-DreamView/dp/B0FJRJ8RG2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HNZLMGWJ3KWM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wMnCK5hien7WrDAf-VwFuV73Bpbe76dWYcKNDJ61lTyzQAmBhylYDMvt7u4jl63xUzMI9P4KZ7AM-IZuBFDf5mDI00wN73cDdKoqlDtuQBsLXn9Ng84cMft4sFSgaZ8Bf1Bk6dTvX5OEC9h2S119KnqNzGmnuTr0c5zo4UfkLOAFNQXYiV6BMMJ4H5UYZkv2NFOdydTpH30V-ZUtaHpdahpad-5TywHS_Lr2cUL2u9pz2g0Ablmacpvqzj2pD4spPg8F3NwE5ohUSMYa8V_72930CByqjPDlP4-x6YXa82w.Cwuu_cstzG-ll9ugZ0o0fx3Z5VrRnFgISOAqDnliyB4&dib_tag=se&keywords=TV%2BBacklight%2B3%2BPro&qid=1761128734&sprefix=%2Caps%2C436&sr=8-1&th=1">which costs $209</a>. The only difference between the two is that the 75 to 85-inch variant gets a 16.4ft LED lightstrip, with the regular model getting 11.8ft.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZYB43BULqWGhu8x52eYLcU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZYB43BULqWGhu8x52eYLcU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like other Govee products, the TV Backlight 3 Pro is straightforward to set up, and installing it took just over 10 minutes. The camera positioning is better this time around, and it does a good job covering the entire length of the TV. On that note, the camera itself is new, and it has a trio of lenses that do are designed to deliver better color accuracy. Having tested it against the T2, that proved to be the case in my usage — the  TV Backlight 3 Pro got brighter, and it delivered better color rendition in HDR content.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vY4RFrWFjE5ZwQzyaELLkU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vY4RFrWFjE5ZwQzyaELLkU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FfMF6R7U7h3EpacHJidonU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FfMF6R7U7h3EpacHJidonU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EhSzEkmaKxcvE3mPtaobeU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EhSzEkmaKxcvE3mPtaobeU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="sLoL7oMaYjgjiMuHS7ZJcU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLoL7oMaYjgjiMuHS7ZJcU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The lights are brighter as well, with Govee using its RGBWWIC tech.

The brand rolled out the Ranger earlier this year, and while the glasses are aimed at cycling, they hold up just as well during any outdoor activity. They're positioned as a 4-in-1 smart sunglasses, able to record footage, deliver built-in audio, serve as a walkie-talkie, and can be used with prescription lenses.</p><p>I've had the glasses for the better part of six months now, but I only started using them in earnest for two months during outdoor workouts, and they've been pretty great. They <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleequp.com/products/bleequp-ranger-ai-sports-camera-glasses-with-pro-grade-sports-goggles">retail for $379</a>, undercutting Meta's offering by a considerable amount. I used the glasses predominantly with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and BleeqUp has an Android app that allows you to pair the glasses with just about any phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="CSxhdCmrhNuvCAnoScGuY3" name="BleeqUp Ranger" alt="BleeqUp Ranger smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSxhdCmrhNuvCAnoScGuY3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5032" height="2834" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's start with the design; the Ranger weighs just 49g, and is just as light as regular sunglasses. It isn't that much chunkier either, and I like what BleeqUp did with the design. A big barrier to entry for smart wearables is the design, and at a quick glance, you can't even tell that the Ranger is any different to regular sunglasses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xAzPnwTmfMh9WoecCAzjg3" name="BleeqUp Ranger" alt="BleeqUp Ranger smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xAzPnwTmfMh9WoecCAzjg3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The glasses are made out of plastic, and I didn't see any issues with the build quality or fit. I got the standard orange lens, but they can be customized with Zeiss lenses as well for an additional $20, and I suggest going this route.

I used several earbuds that have xMEMS drivers, and they do a good job delivering decent sound while taking up a fraction of the space as traditional audio drivers. The open-ear configuration combines good audio quality with the ability to filter ambient sounds.</p><p>Ultimately, the Ranger is a great choice for any outdoor activity, and the integrated design makes it a good choice if you need sunglasses with additional smarts.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="09f4d11f-36ef-48bc-80f6-5b20a820adad">            <a href="https://www.bleequp.com/products/bleequp-ranger-ai-sports-camera-glasses" data-model-name="BleeqUp Ranger " ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:83.09%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qt88swg2xfNaAofdX9ZRzP.jpg' alt="BleeqUp Ranger"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">BleeqUp Ranger </div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Ranger glasses look like regular sunglasses, but they come with plenty of smarts, and they do a great job outdoors. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

In a Reddit post, the company states that it's rolling out two versions of this patch for Pixels. Users with a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a will see vBP41.250916.010, while every other eligible Pixel sees vBP41.250916.010.<strong>A1</strong>.</p><p>While users who may have held off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">can download Beta 3.1</a> (after enrolling), Google is offering a few solutions for those caught in the loop when QPR2 Beta 3 rolled out last week.</p><p>To begin, Google states users can wait and see if their device "recovers" back to Beta 2 after failing to boot properly. If that doesn't work, the company suggests USB debugging, if you've got that enabled (before the looping occurred). Another option involves downloading the Beta 3.1 OTA from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr2/download-ota">Android's Developer</a> site and placing your phone in Recovery mode to install the update.</p><p>Google has provided <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1obvh9e/android_16_qpr2_beta_31_now_available/">a step-by-step set of instructions</a> for five viable solutions to the bootlooping issue from QPR2 Beta 3.  It's worth noting that two solutions should be seen as a last resort, as they will wipe all of your device's data if used.</p><h2 id="major-problems-2">Major problems</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1obvh9e/android_16_qpr2_beta_31_now_available">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3.1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Last week <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr2-beta-3-changes">brought Google's next wave</a> of Android 16 tests to enrolled testers, packed with a new button for app shortcuts. An added "+" icon brings more awareness to users that they can pin an app's shortcut. Other additions in the recent test brought Live Captions shortcuts for volume and even larger icons for the search bar.</p><p>QPR2 Beta 3 was quite a substantial patch, judging by its extensive changelog for Pixels, but it was quickly soured a day later by user reports.</p><p>That's when users started reporting the bootloop problems after trying to shift into Beta 3. It was reported that Google quickly removed the patch to avoid any more problems and to keep users who may not have known away from it.</p><p>So far, a few user reports on Reddit claim the patch has solved the issue.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is a clear way forward for the company to challenge Meta on a substantial level, offering users a way to get familiar functionality without the negative feelings some people harbor toward Meta as a company.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE" name="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" alt="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1584" height="891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Based on this, we can expect Gentle Monster glasses to look like a normal pair of specs, complete with many different style , lens, and color options.

We should also expect these glasses to have cameras on them for recording life from a first-person perspective.</p><p>Samsung's partnership with Warby Parker sounds similar, with the company noting that it's "working with pioneering lifestyle brand Warby Parker, known for leveraging technology to create beautifully designed eyewear and deliver exceptional customer experiences."</p><p>To me, this sounds more like Samsung's direct answer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses</a> (that's the one with the display in the lens), similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">we already got to use at Google I/O this year</a>.

Announced today, the device marks the start of a long-term push from Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm to blend artificial intelligence with immersive computing, a move that could reshape how people work, play, and explore digital spaces.</p><p>At its core, the Galaxy XR is built on Android XR, a new platform co-developed by the three tech giants, with Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> AI baked right in. This means it’s not just a headset running Android apps but also an AI-powered device that understands your surroundings, responds naturally through voice, vision, and gesture, and helps you manage tasks in a more human-like way. Think of it as a spatial computing assistant that doesn’t just take commands but sees what you see and reacts accordingly.</p><p>Samsung calls the Galaxy XR the first step in its XR journey, with more form factors — including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">AI glasses</a> — already in the works. The headset’s design focuses on comfort for long sessions, using lightweight materials, a balanced frame, and a detachable light shield. The battery pack is separate, too, making the device lighter on the head while still lasting up to 2.5 hours on a charge.</p><p>Under the hood, it runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 platform, with 16GB of memory and a Micro-OLED display pushing 29 million pixels at up to 90Hz. The visuals are said to be sharp, immersive, and backed by immersive sound from a dual-speaker setup. It also tracks your head, hands, and eyes with precision using a mix of cameras and sensors.</p><h2 id="your-favorite-android-apps-reimagined-in-3d-2">Your favorite Android apps, reimagined in 3D</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3634px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.79%;"><img id="siMn6Mk5PBkApawNiuoKVU" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/siMn6Mk5PBkApawNiuoKVU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3634" height="2427" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="cxXQANwssegypWVFB9SYcS" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR side profile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cxXQANwssegypWVFB9SYcS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="Uv5zjFjU6iH7kRCMd7VmjS" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR front view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uv5zjFjU6iH7kRCMd7VmjS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="KateGtDyuEZueAkRmseFyS" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KateGtDyuEZueAkRmseFyS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="27LnPiqZtc3JCFQRd4RvzS" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27LnPiqZtc3JCFQRd4RvzS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 6 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="jNzoqLjqDXHFoam8mDQr5T" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR top view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jNzoqLjqDXHFoam8mDQr5T.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Out of the box, Galaxy XR supports familiar Android experiences in 3D form — Google Maps, YouTube, Google Photos, and even Circle to Search — all optimized for the new environment. You can navigate cities in 3D, explore YouTube videos with real-time AI context, or simply draw a circle in midair to identify objects around you. Google Photos’ new Media Auto Spatialization further adds depth to your 2D pictures and videos.</p><p>The headset also doubles as a personal theater, letting you stream in 4K, catch multiple sports games at once, or play AI-enhanced XR games where Gemini offers coaching and gameplay tips. For creators, tools like Adobe’s Project Pulsar make 3D editing and cinematic layering easy and intuitive.</p><h2 id="from-play-to-productivity-xr-goes-enterprise-2">From play to productivity: XR goes enterprise</h2><p>Samsung isn’t stopping at consumer use either. The company is expanding Galaxy XR into enterprise, with partners like Samsung Heavy Industries using it for virtual shipbuilding training. It’s also working with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Spaces ecosystem to help developers bring XR business solutions to life.</p><p>And if the headset isn’t futuristic enough, Samsung’s also teasing upcoming AI glasses made with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, blending smart tech with high-end fashion.</p><p>The Galaxy XR is available starting October 21, 2025, for $1,800, through samsung.com and Samsung Experience Stores. Optional accessories like the Galaxy XR Controller and Travel Case go for $250 each. Early buyers get The Explorer Pack, a bundle worth over $1,000, which includes year-long access to Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium, Google Play Pass, and a mix of premium XR content.</p> ]]></dc:content>

So when Samsung invited me to New York City to demo its Android XR headset, I was ready to dig deeper into Samsung's answer to Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest Pro.</p><p>I left my 30-minute demo disappointed, not by the headset, but because it only scratched the surface. I enjoyed a spatial 3D tour of NYC in Google Maps with Gemini as my guide and saw 2D YouTube videos converted into 3D using AI — just like I did during my last hands-on.</p><p>This demo reinforced the fact that Samsung has the hardware absolutely nailed: Galaxy XR is wonderfully comfortable, surprisingly light and well-balanced, and features the best resolution (3,552 x 3,840) that I've ever seen on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headset</a>.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a> failed despite great hardware for the time, because no one wanted a $2,000 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-readying-799-quest-pro-three-other-vr-headsets-by-2024">"laptop for your face"</a> with only a handful of app partners and use cases. And Apple Vision Pro has its own app and gaming shortcomings, though it's sold much better.</p><p>So if you can feel immersed in a $300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a>, why spend $1,799 on Galaxy XR? The answer is apps: You need a mix of productivity, gaming, streaming, social, and browsing software, available to use <strong>simultaneously</strong>, to keep people in the headset <strong>all day</strong>, multiple days per week.</p><p>I wish I could have taken off the kiddie gloves and really put <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> through its paces. However, my Galaxy XR demo — along with multiple demos on stage and in the press lounge that went more in-depth — proved that Samsung has pulled off something impressive and compelling, with Google's software as the ace in the hole.</p><p>The only question is whether Galaxy XR does enough to break through the current state of XR apathy.</p><div ><table><caption>Samsung Galaxy XR specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Specifications</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>16GB RAM; 256GB storage</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>3,552 x 3,840, 29 million pixels Micro-OLED; 96% DCI-P3</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>60Hz, 72Hz (default), 90Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Field of view</p></td><td  ><p>109ºH; 100ºV</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>6.5MP; 18mm/ F2.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Two passthrough cameras; six world-facing tracking cameras; four eye-tracking cameras; five IMUs; one depth sensor; one flicker sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mics & speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Six-mic array with beamforming; two dual speakers (Woofer + Tweeter)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio codecs</p></td><td  ><p>MP3, AMR-NB/WB, AAC/ AAC+/ eAAC+, Vorbis, FLAC, Opus, Dolby Digital (Plus, Atmos)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video</p></td><td  ><p>Resolution: UDH 8K (7,680 x 4,320) @ 60FPS</p><p>Codecs: H.263, H.264, HEVC, MV-HEVC, MPEG-4, VC-1, VP8, VP9, AV1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours general use, 2.5 hours video watching</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7 (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be); Bluetooth 5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>IPD</p></td><td  ><p>54–70mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>545g with forehead cushion (not including light shield)</p><p>Battery weighs 302g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="gemini-is-the-key-to-the-galaxy-xr-experience-2">Gemini is the key to the Galaxy XR experience</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3985px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Y6KDb7EUQt2MPWWjXNBfTY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-press-demo" alt="Photo of Samsung's Jin Park and Max Spear standing on stage, Spear wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, with a Google Photos demo on a screen behind them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y6KDb7EUQt2MPWWjXNBfTY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3985" height="2242" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before my personal demo, Samsung engineer Jin Park and Google XR Product Lead Max Spear gave a live demo of the headset on stage, and the main throughline of every app showcase was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>.</p><p>Gemini speedily opened apps, shared good pizza places nearby in Maps, generated a Halloween-themed video with an accompanying nursery rhyme via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-3-veo-3-fast-fast-video-creation-vertex-ai-feature-teaser-announced">Veo 3</a>, interpreted and explained the context for YouTube videos about golf and English architecture, and gave gaming walkthrough tips for Stardew Valley as Spear played.</p><p>Most ambitious was a game called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt37600020/">Asteroid</a>, directed by Bourne director Doug Liman, in which Gemini creates scripts and personalized responses for NPCs, voiced by actors and celebrities like Doug Perlman, Hailee Steinfeld, and D.K. Metcalf. Park spoke to "Metcalf," and when she switched to Korean, so did Gemini, translating Metcalf's dialogue while still using his voice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-pinch-controls" alt="A photo of the author wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, holding up one hand in a pinch gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Testing Google Maps in Galaxy XR </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The demo available to journalists was much less ambitious in scope, but I did get the chance to dive into a truly immersive version of Google Maps and have Gemini act as a tour guide. Last time, I explored Yosemite and learned the history of El Capitan; this time, I looked around New York City to find places to visit.</p><p>Something new to the experience was that Google has begun to create "full digital reconstructions of indoor spaces using just 2D imagery and AI."</p><p>Basically, so long as Google has enough user-provided photos of a restaurant, museum, or attraction, you can warp inside it and then drag yourself around the space using gesture controls, seeing what a place looks like "in person" before you visit it yourself. Spear said they have "over 1,000 of these available in New York City alone."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QEU5Xs8NSYTNdwSfZsnMsB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-gesture-controls" alt="A photo of the author doing a two-handed pinch-to-zoom gesture while wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEU5Xs8NSYTNdwSfZsnMsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Pinching-and-zooming is seamless </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also dove into YouTube on Galaxy XR. Like last time, they showcased 180-degree and 360-degree videos that take full advantage of VR, as well as stereoscopic content with a 3D effect.</p><p>What most intrigued me was how Google used AI to automatically add spatial layers to 2D videos, subtly transforming old 2D content instead of depending on a limited 3D library.</p><p>Google also added a spatial multiview mode to YouTube for watching multiple live sports games simultaneously. I can't see this coming up very often, but it goes to show how multitasking is a key draw to Galaxy XR.</p><p>Otherwise, Samsung is promising that Galaxy XR will be the "only" XR device with Netflix, with a traditional VR theater view and resizable windows. We'll have to wait and see what other streaming apps appear; in theory, any Play Store app should be available.</p><h2 id="a-mix-of-casual-and-enterprise-use-cases-2">A mix of casual and enterprise use cases</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M8E9jXaETRhiuqkWo7J8fM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-controllers-2" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset's controllers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8E9jXaETRhiuqkWo7J8fM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> owner, I've wondered how Galaxy XR would handle gaming.

It was a nice surprise to see Galaxy XR's independently tracked controllers — even if they cost $249 extra.</p><p>Any Play Store games should be playable in a windowed format on Galaxy XR.

But Samsung has an advantage: "All apps built on the Android platform work right out of the box on Galaxy XR." Only a few apps will be "Made for XR," but early adopters won't be waiting impatiently for the promise of new content.

And since you can use a controller or mouse/ keyboard in addition to pinch gestures, it's an upgrade on taps and swipes.</p><p>The real question is whether people can afford to buy this in addition to a laptop, since wearing <em>anything</em> for eight hours a day can be onerous, let alone a one-pound headset. But if you'd normally consider buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/should-you-buy-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-or-s11-ultra">Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</a> for $1,300, the jump to $1,799 may not be that insurmountable to your budget.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3LizsCrDiGus5EiZbLvJdM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-from-behind-lenses" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset sitting on a pedestal, focused on the lenses and padding." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3LizsCrDiGus5EiZbLvJdM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can't predict how well Galaxy XR will sell, despite its tremendous potential. Samsung made sure to mention in its keynote and press release that it'll make AI smart glasses soon, using Warby Parker and Gentle Monster designs. It felt like a reminder that glasses have become more popular, while headsets have fallen out of vogue.</p><p>Having already tested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google's AR glasses prototype</a>, I do think Android XR will work well for Samsung's smart glasses.

Galaxy XR has the display and power necessary for a much wider range of use cases.</p><p>While my Galaxy XR hands-on was disappointingly short, the live demos worked near-flawlessly on stage, and they convinced me that "Project Moohan" is an impressive device for anyone who can afford it.

The publication states that the One UI 8 update for the Galaxy S23 series has seemingly disappeared from Samsung's servers. While the post speculates this One UI 8 suspension may not last long, nothing's clear. Samsung's software is no longer accessible by users' devices; however, it hasn't explained why.</p><p>The publication highlights that Galaxy S23 users who've gotten the update (it's been out for a few weeks now) haven't reported major issues.</p><p>Curiously, X user Akhilesh Kumar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Koram_Akhilesh/status/1980536427017564172">reported on the same situation</a>, stating the patch was pulled from servers concerning European and Indian users. The safest bet right now is that Samsung's discovered an issue with its software and pulled it before it affected too many people.</p><p>A few users on X replied to the post, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/samsung_now389/status/1980570228921942173">wondering if others</a> were having battery drain problems. Some with a Galaxy S23 state their battery is performing more or less the same as it has been. There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BoogieD262/status/1980558886668284052">was one user who reported</a> that their Galaxy S23 FE <em>is </em>struggling with battery life and that they can't use their phone for "more than three hours."</p><p>Perhaps this is the issue Samsung has identified, but it's probably best not to wonder and face reality: One UI 8 is suspended for the S23 series.</p><h2 id="what-s-really-going-on-2">What's really going on?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TTCatu8L3QoUmhnWWfkSDf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-display-home-screen-01.jpg" alt="The home screen of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TTCatu8L3QoUmhnWWfkSDf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>What's (not-so) funny is that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-early-one-ui-8-on-galaxy-s23-android-16-expands">started rolling out its One UI 8 update</a> to the Galaxy S23 series on September 29. The patch was ahead of schedule, as we weren't expecting the Android 16-based OS to arrive until October. Galaxy S23 users were given a huge 3GB download, packed with the latest goodies, security features, and more. The rollout appeared fine, as, again, reports were riddled with problems.</p><p>However, that's no longer the case, as Samsung yanked it, which it's already done with the Galaxy S22 series. This strangely happened a week after the S22 series started downloading the new patch, indicating Samsung spotted something amiss quite quickly.</p><p>Nearly a week ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-halts-one-ui-8-update-for-galaxy-s24-in-south-korea">Samsung suspended</a> its One UI 8 update on the Galaxy S24 series. The suspension was spotted for consumers with the models in South Korea first, as its OTA file vanished. Reports added that the S24 FE was roped into the pause, as well. Much like the S23, Samsung has refrained from stating why it's stopped the rollout, despite previously rolling through its scheduled plans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The main highlight states users can soon expect Live Updates to bring "key travel journeys that include flights, train trips, and events."</p><p>Google also details that it's bringing an update that moves Gmail closer to Wallet for passes.

These alerts were constant updates that users could lean on about their train rides, knowing whether or not it's delayed, on time, or otherwise.

They're not designed to stay secure and withstand sweat or water like a dedicated pair of fitness earbuds. Fitness buffs will turn to alternatives instead, which are expensive.</p><p>Our favorite fitness earbuds are the in-ear Powerbeats Pro 2 at $250 and the open-air <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-2-review">Shokz OpenFit 2</a> at $180. While both are great, their price tags might be tough to justify for people who already own one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>. The question is: do you need to spend that much to get a pair of Android earbuds that'll handle the gym, the track, and everything in between?</p><p>To find out, I tested Belkin's new SoundForm ActiveFit earbuds — an intriguing pair of fitness buds priced at just $42. That's a fraction of the cost of a Powerbeats Pro 2 set. Even as a Powerbeats enjoyer, I wasn't convinced my preferred running earbuds were more than five times better than the SoundForm ActiveFit.</p><p>After using the SoundForm ActiveFit and the Powerbeats Pro 2 side by side, Belkin's offering blew me away. There are clear shortcomings, as you'd expect, but the value proposition for the SoundForm ActiveFit is readily apparent.</p><h2 id="how-the-belkin-soundform-activefit-cover-the-basics-2">How the Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit cover the basics</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6wA5V34hpfUXuHDCs4k699" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-1" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wA5V34hpfUXuHDCs4k699.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Normally, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend buying a pair of earbuds this cheap. You get what you pay for where audio is concerned, although the gap between budget and premium earbuds seems to be closing more by the day. It's a completely different story for workout earbuds — sound quality is lower on the list of key features.</p><p>While crisp vocals and booming bass are always appreciated, they're not necessities for fitness earbuds. Instead, traits such as water and sweat resistance, battery life, comfort and fit, and awareness loom large. The last point is crucial. Awareness is needed for safety while running, walking, or biking in public areas, and that's why people often turn to earbuds with ANC and transparency mode.</p><p>Letting the right sounds in ensures a runner or biker is tuned into their surroundings. The problem? ANC and transparency are quite hard to find on budget earbuds. That's why I was surprised to see "Hear-Thru Mode" on the SoundForm ActiveFit, which uses the onboard microphones to enable passthrough sound.</p><p>It's essential for outdoor workouts, even if it's not <em>true</em> ANC or transparency mode in the conventional sense.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HDbEvDPLthvHPSCP6fsbA9" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-4" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HDbEvDPLthvHPSCP6fsbA9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The next thing I look for in workout earbuds is a comfortable and secure fit. Belkin checks this box with a silicone ear hook that wraps around your ear for maximum security. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> have this too, but don't feel as stable in the ear — likely because they're a bit smaller and have a different insertion angle.</p><p>Durability and sweat-resistance are covered by an IP54 rating, matching the Beats' IPX4 liquid certification but adding dust resistance. You get nine hours of playback from the earbuds, plus another 27 hours from the charging case. The case itself has USB-C and a built-in lanyard loop, perfect for living in your gym bag.</p><h2 id="how-the-powerbeats-pro-2-justify-their-lofty-price-tag-2">How the Powerbeats Pro 2 justify their lofty price tag</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pAYWgdLWKCLEY7qQDUqNC9" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-3" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pAYWgdLWKCLEY7qQDUqNC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The SoundForm ActiveFit are actually solid in terms of volume, even if the earbuds tend to get tinny at higher volumes. The default EQ profile is Belkin Signature Sound, and you can switch to Bass Boost and Balanced if you please.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend it, however, as the sound signature simply sounds off in the other modes. One boosts the bass at the expense of everything else, and the other cuts it out almost entirely.</p><p>This is where the Powerbeats Pro 2 comparatively shine. They're better-sounding with a balanced profile that borrows sound signature and hardware from the famed AirPods Pro 2. Additionally, their on-earbuds controls are better, with Beats providing physical buttons on each bud plus a volume rocker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-5" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 also add active noise-canceling, transparency mode, and an Adaptive EQ setting. Battery life is slightly longer, at 10 hours from the earbuds on a single charge. They generally have more microphones and sensors, but the SoundForm ActiveFit do support a newer version of Bluetooth.</p><p>The elephant in the room here is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro">the Powerbeats Pro 2's support for heart-rate monitoring</a> via an in-built optical sensor. There is also an accelerometer and gyroscope for good measure; the Powerbeats Pro 2 put the <em>fitness</em> in fitness earbuds.</p><p>The thing is, all these upgrade areas fall firmly in the "nice-to-have" category rather than the "essential" category.</p><h2 id="do-you-need-to-spend-a-fortune-on-workout-earbuds-2">Do you need to spend a fortune on workout earbuds?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iBuCRfM3SRHy2cc7cwBta9" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-5" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iBuCRfM3SRHy2cc7cwBta9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As such, I'm confident saying you probably would do just fine with the $42 earbuds instead of the $250 ones. I've run countless miles with some generation of Powerbeats in my ears, and could definitely make the switch to the Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit and not miss a beat.</p><p>They cover all the basics, and the $42 price point is a feature in itself. If one earbud falls down the storm drain or gets crushed by a dumbbell, you probably won't lose any sleep over it.

That's a lot of capital letters in one name but you might start typing in all caps when you see this incredible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-NXTPAPER-T-Mobile-Smartphone-Paper-Like/dp/B0F62N5KXF"><strong>$199 deal</strong></a> for the phone right now on Amazon.</p><p>That's a solid 20% off the price and you don't even need to wait until Black Friday to get it!

Plus, that backlight is 100% flicker-free, ensuring that even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> people can use the phone without headaches.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="173af2c0-968c-447f-8b19-573ac05e0f9b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This budget-priced phone feels ever-so-premium thanks to the impressive TCL NXTPAPER technology powering its eye-friendly display.

You can configure this to automatically switch to one of the three alternate display options — color paper, ink paper, and max ink — or just choose via pop-up box that appears when you slide the key upward.</p><p>That makes it handy for switching between screen modes when you're just in the mood to read. Ink paper mode is best for reading books, while color paper mode is best for things like manga or comics. Max ink mode is for those times you want to unplug and get a bit of digital detox in for a while, as it turns on extra battery saver and shuts down most apps.</p><p>The camera is also quite good for the price range, offering punchy shots with good color and nice dynamic range. Plus, the phone ships with Andorid 15 under the hood.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9zwTMDJGG9gFHLAFoq3eP9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-06" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER apps in Max Ink Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9zwTMDJGG9gFHLAFoq3eP9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3963" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As Derrek noted in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-review">TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER 5G review</a>, this phone isn't a powerhouse and won't be impressing anyone with its performance. You shouldn't ever expect a $199 phone to be as fast as a $1,000 phone, but it's still worth noting before jumping in.</p><p>And as much as I love NXTPAPER technology, the screen is a little difficult to see outside during those extra bright days. It's something you can get used to and may be a worthy trade-off if you prefer reading indoors but, again, well worth noting if you're a person who spends a lot of time looking at their phone outside.</p><p>Even with those downsides, it's hard to say no to this phone for just $199. That's a heck of a deal that won't be any lower for a long time to come.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And I already know I'll wear these more than my Ray-Bans.</p><p><em>You</em> may not need the Vanguard's IP67 water resistance for sweaty workouts, 6db-louder speakers to counterbalance wind, or an extra hour of battery life for longer activities. They're not the right fit for using indoors, with no Transitions or clear lenses; nor is the Oakley Spheara style suited to "blending in" like Ray-Ban Wayfarers.</p><p>I don't depend on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> for every occasion, as Meta would like; it's only during workouts or hikes, when my phone is an unwelcome distraction, that Meta's AI answers, hands-free videos, and workout playlists really compel me.</p><p>While I was impressed during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 testing</a>, they're still better suited for casual wear. With the Oakley Meta Vanguard, it's clear that these are the better fit for runners, hikers, cyclists, or extreme sports fans — despite some caveats I'll explain below.</p><h2 id="i-actually-prefer-the-oakley-meta-vanguard-design-2">I actually prefer the Oakley Meta Vanguard design</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="pWmRnXwmQEPgmoMmL6cKue" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-on-face-2" alt="A photo of the author wearing Oakley Meta Vanguard with a valley behind him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pWmRnXwmQEPgmoMmL6cKue.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-glasses-selfie-clear-lenses" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses with Clear lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Smart glasses are noticeably thicker than normal glasses to fit the cameras, speakers, and battery, as well as bear the weight. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)s aren't <em>bad</em> in this respect, but every non-techie I've had try them on says they like the features but not the chunky look on their face.</p><p>Most Oakley sunglasses, on the other hand, are massive and flashy, with a thick nose guard and top bar; this gives the Meta Vanguards leeway to be big without seeming out of place. They're twice as heavy as the Spheara design that inspired them, but I feel sporty wearing them, instead of dorky.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zEJEHutjQ3aGozL6HgTu7f" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-back-view" alt="A photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses from the back, with the arms extended toward the camera and the back of the lenses in the center." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEJEHutjQ3aGozL6HgTu7f.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jdA58mWTKBReXECXmjiene" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-front-view" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard of the front lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdA58mWTKBReXECXmjiene.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ixsgvYPqXWKCbZ2Wyyzsue" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-right-side-view-Oakley-logo" alt="A top-side view of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses on a wooden table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ixsgvYPqXWKCbZ2Wyyzsue.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ELHWRLvaZTmnMo8wgUGuhe" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-nose-pads" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard's nose pad and Meta logo between the lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELHWRLvaZTmnMo8wgUGuhe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fVfvisCeyN4kRuusiU3hBf" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-left-arm" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard's left arm showing the Oakley name and manufacturing info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fVfvisCeyN4kRuusiU3hBf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>You'll have to accept that these glasses weigh a lot, putting pressure on your nose. But unlike with Ray-Bans that need to be fitted tightly to your face to avoid sliding, the Vanguard's built-in nose pads prevent sliding, even with sweat and the up-down motion of running.</p><p>Still, it's a pressure point where 66g of weight presses down, especially for any downhill running or hiking. It won't affect you much after a single workout, and cyclists should be okay unless they're bouncing up and down mountain paths for hours. But after a long hike on Saturday and a two-hour run on Sunday, my nose feels sore and needs a break.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nwCgVtd6FxJPX5McnNoKze" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-top-down-view" alt="A top view of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses showing the top bar and arms." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwCgVtd6FxJPX5McnNoKze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some people won't mind the extra weight for the best smart glasses experience, while others will find them cumbersome.

cool if Meta gave the Vanguard <strong>landscape</strong> photos and videos. I know that portrait mode is what's in vogue for Meta's apps or TikTok, but the GoPro athletic crowd wants as wide and immersive a view as possible. Even if portrait is the default, Meta should allow us to switch perspectives with a voice command or button tap.</p><p>I also recorded videos using 1080p at 30/60FPS and 3K at 30FPS at various points during a 13-mile run. I can't embed them here, but I can assure you that it's difficult to tell them apart! The 3K view is slightly more immersive, but more prone to jittering from fast movement; I preferred the 60FPS mode, which looks wondefully smooth and creates the feeling of gliding down my running path.</p><p>My only real problem was that the Oakleys' revamped speakers are so loud and rich that your music is audible in videos; I've learned to pause my music before recording.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BWfZmteW2MPX4ssMAMAdH" name="oakley-meta-vanguard-official-lifestyle-01" alt="An official lifestyle image of a person wearing Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BWfZmteW2MPX4ssMAMAdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Vanguard's slow-motion videos are best suited to extreme sports </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Vanguard has four different stabilization settings — Auto, Low, Medium, and High — based on how much you want to balance out or preserve rapid movement. I didn't get to play with these settings too much, but it's great to see Meta putting this power in the hands of users, and the High setting is, again, buttery smooth.</p><p>Of the Vanguard's two new video modes (slow-mo and hyperlapse), I absolutely loved creating hyperlapse videos of my hike, fast-forwarding through my slow climb down a steep hill and then winding down the trail path.

It's partially due to mistrust of Meta, and partially because they can just glance down at their wrist for the data.</p><p>I plan to write a more in-depth test of Garmin and Strava integration on these glasses, but for now, I've been impressed by how speedily Meta AI can pull your live information like current/ average pace, elevation gain, cadence, running power, HR zone, and other stats within a second of asking.</p><p>Meta AI can't recognize every stat that Garmin tracks, but I still appreciate getting the highlights without have to search through data fields on the go.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JNzPdRyHKoSGPTgzcbKFeD" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-with-Meta-AI-workout-summary" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses sitting on a treadmill next to a phone showing a Meta AI workout summary." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNzPdRyHKoSGPTgzcbKFeD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not especially fun to pant out "Hey Meta" before every request, but at least the "Respond without 'Hey Meta'" setting lets you ask follow-ups easily.

That's about on pace with what I've experienced, but I don't <em>only</em> stream music; I'm also taking frequent photos or videos, which burn through battery much more quickly.</p><p>Here's a better barometer for battery life: During a 2-hour run, Garmin Autocapture took 24 five-second videos, while I recorded another seven 30-second videos for my video stabilization testing; I also listened constantly to music and asked Meta AI for Garmin stats about 20 times. I ended at 49% battery, putting me on pace for 4 hours with <strong>heavy</strong> usage.</p><p>If I chilled out with the commands and videos, I think Oakley Meta Vanguard could last long enough to accompany a marathon run, or a 100km ride for a competent cyclist.</p><p>Even if the battery capacity fades with time, Oakley Meta Vanguards have a really solid baseline, and I appreciate that we get IP67 dust and water resistance to withstand sweaty workouts or accidental drops on dusty trails.

However, this South Korean report suggests that Samsung's advancements may have pushed the Exynos 2600 over the speed of Apple's and Qualcomm's latest chips. The report compares the chip to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, purporting that Samsung's is roughly 29% better in graphical performance and 30% better in NPU.</p><p>When it comes to Apple's A19 Pro, rumors state the Exynos 2600 is ~75% graphically and potentially ~14% better in multi-core (CPU) performance.</p><p>These rumors reiterate what we've heard before, that the Exynos 2600 is built on Samsung's 2nm process. AI is another major part of the chip that's reportedly going to shine through on the Galaxy S26 series. The publication claims that Samsung "focused heavily on AI performance," seeking to surpass that of Apple's devices.</p><p>Such a report makes it seem like Samsung is going to utilize its chip in as many places as possible, but that might not be the case.

It’s built around an AI server-grade liquid that stays stable from -60°C to 108°C, paired with a 24,000rpm fan, a ceramic micro-pump, and a four-layer heat dissipation setup. Oh, and the liquid actually moves visibly inside a translucent ring on the back.</p><p>Under the hood, the RedMagic 11 Pro packs Qualcomm’s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, backed by up to 24GB of LPDDR5T RAM and UFS 4.1 Pro storage. RedMagic also threw in its own RedCore R4 chip to handle touch and graphics optimization, and even a PC emulator in the China version.</p><h2 id="the-trade-off-a-smaller-global-battery-2">The trade-off: A smaller global battery?</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="wGo9MTjPB4ZuTwds2Hp6ET" name="RedMagic-11-Pro" alt="back side of the RedMagic 11 Pro in silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGo9MTjPB4ZuTwds2Hp6ET.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yG5evH9rXMXiF58P3e8bsS" name="RedMagic-11-Pro" alt="back side of the RedMagic 11 Pro in black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yG5evH9rXMXiF58P3e8bsS.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Battery life is another flex point — an 8,000mAh cell that supports 120W wired and 80W wireless charging. RedMagic says it can last over 13 hours in MOBA games. The tradeoff for the upcoming global release, though, is that international models might get a smaller battery to comply with regional safety standards, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Global-release-confirmed-RedMagic-11-Pro-to-launch-internationally-but-with-major-battery-caveat.1140945.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>.</p><p>Up front, you get a 6.8-inch BOE X10 AMOLED display with 2,688 × 1,216 resolution, 144Hz refresh rate, and an under-display camera. The display also supports eye protection tech for marathon gaming sessions.</p><p>Cameras are surprisingly capable for a gaming phone — dual 50MP shooters and advanced streaming support up to 8K60Hz.</p><p>The RedMagic 11 Pro starts at 4,999 RMB (around $680) in China and comes in black, silver, and transparent editions. The global launch is set for November 3, where we’ll see if RedMagic brings all its cooling tricks overseas or keeps some of the magic exclusive to China.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This update specifically concerns Meta's AI characters and the personal chats users can have with them, one-on-one. For Teen Accounts, Meta states parents will have three new capabilities accessible, beginning with the ability to disable AI character chats completely.</p><p>Instead of having these characters for questions and answers, Meta states that any Teen Account with that disabled will still have access to its AI assistant. Through the assistant, the AI will tune its answers to be educational and age-appropriate for teenagers.</p><p>Meta is also planning to bring the option for parents to block specific AI characters that their teenager has access to. This would serve as an alternative to disabling the feature completely. Lastly, Meta plans to give parents better insight into the conversations their teens are having with AI characters and the company's AI assistant.</p><p>The post adds that these three planned upgrades come off the back of "concerns" parents have expressed about their children interacting with AI chatbots.</p><h2 id="protections-for-younger-users-2">Protections for younger users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:689px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="57QUKoZCVFVmggYWxUAPHh" name="meta-instagram-parental-settings-approval-request.jpg" alt="Supervised teen accounts on Instagram must request approval when changing settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/57QUKoZCVFVmggYWxUAPHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="689" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The company states that it seeks to have guardrails in place so parents can be further informed and can have the right discussions with their teens, if need be.</p><p>These AI/parental tools will start on Instagram in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia (English users) "early next year."</p><p>Teen Accounts <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-is-rolling-out-a-restricted-version-of-its-app-for-teens">rolled out around this time last year</a>, as a restricted version of Instagram where parents can monitor and control what their child sees. Teens under 16 years of age qualify for a Teen Account, and these profiles are defaulted to "private," forcing users to approve users who attempt to follow them. Sensitive content in the Explore tab and Reels is much harder to come by, as well.</p><p>Meta rolled these out, as previously stated, in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia before other countries last year. It hit Europe two months later, before arriving globally the following year. There's a chance we'll see a similar rollout to this updated vision Meta has for parents and their kids.</p><p>Just last month, Instagram's AI gained the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagrams-ai-now-detects-and-protects-teens-even-if-their-profile-says-theyre-adults">ability to detect teen accounts</a> even if they've lied about their age. If the AI determines a user is underage, it will automatically switch their account to a Teen Account. This update also brought notifications to parents in Canada.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, most phones I used in 2025 did a great job delivering on both fronts; devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a> have incredible cameras that run tings around what Google and Samsung have to offer, and they last longer.</p><p>Interestingly, this year's launches have been characterized by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">mainstream use of silicon battery tech.</a> This has allowed Chinese phone manufacturers to predominantly use bigger batteries without any material difference in size or weight. The result is that most phones I used in 2025 came with 6,000mAh batteries, lasting a day and a half without breaking a sweat.</p><p>In fact, battery anxiety is a thing of the past, and outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-is-the-coolest-phone-i-used-in-2025">iPhone Air</a>, there isn't a single phone where the battery didn't comfortably last a day. What's notable is that Chinese phone brands are now starting to add even bigger batteries in their phones, leading to devices with 7,000mAh or larger batteries.</p><p>The result is that we are finally at a point where phones can reliably last two days between charges. Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/i-used-the-vivo-x300-and-x300-pro">X300 Pro</a> has a 6,510mAh battery, and the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max and Find X9 Pro have even bigger 7,500mAh batteries. In fact, most Chinese brands are going this route with their latest phones, and while I was initially worried that the thin phone trend would catch on, I'm glad to see that hasn't been the case.</p><p>Clearly, this is made possible by adding a mix of a silicon-carbon in the anode, and while 2025 phones only had a 10% silicon content in the batteries, brands are increasingly using higher ratios of silicon, and that's how we are getting bigger batteries in phones that aren't any heavier or bulkier than their predecessors.</p><p>One downside to this is that not all global models are getting the same battery size. While Vivo sells the X300 Pro with a 6,510mAh battery in Asian markets, the Austrian unit has a significantly smaller 5,440mAh unit, which is just annoying. I'm using the Austrian unit of the X300 Pro, and while I still get a day's use easily, it doesn't last as long as the X200 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, the Find X9 Pro, Xiaomi 17 Pro Max, and iQOO 15 should have the same battery size in all countries, giving these devices a distinct edge over their rivals. Another factor to consider is the charging tech; while Chinese brands dabbled with 120W and 150W standards, the industry has settled around 90W and 100W charging, and this is again down to the use of silicon batteries.</p><p>From conversations with device makers, it's evident that 90W is seen as the sweet spot these days; it is fast enough that even a 7,000mAh battery is able to charge in an hour, and it doesn't lead to any unnecessary battery degradation. What I like even better is that most Chinese phones now offer USB PD integration at least up to 50W, and this makes charging these battery behemoths easier.</p><p>Like last year, the battery advancements are limited to Chinese manufacturers, with Apple, Google, and Samsung largely unbothered by silicon battery tech. While Google went with a slightly bigger battery on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, it's clear that these brands have no intention of using silicon-based anodes on their devices anytime soon, handing over all the momentum to their Chinese rivals.</p><p>As much as I'd like to see a Pixel or Galaxy phone that lasts two days between charges, it's evident that we are still a few years away from that. Thankfully, that isn't the case with the latest Chinese phones, and with these devices set to debut globally in the coming weeks, you don't have to wait too long if you're looking to upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p>Sales, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Amazon's Prime Day</a> events or any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday deals days</a>, are a great time to buy a new phone. They are also a time when regular pricing trends go out the window.</p><p>Normally, last year's model gets a healthy price cut when the new one launches, and buying one is a good way to get a great phone while saving a nice chink of money. Big sales can change this, though.</p><p>We saw it during the last one with the Google Pixel. Normally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro</a> is a good bit cheaper now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 Pro</a> is here.

However, there are some good reasons to buy a relatively new model versus a brand new one, though.</p><p><strong>You will save some money</strong>. Once stock of a new model arrives, retailers want to move out all the existing stock, meaning they need to catch your eye, and the very best way to do that is to cut the price.</p><p><strong>It's still new</strong>. When you buy a 2024 phone in 2025, it's probably still going to be brand new. That means you'll get the full warranty, and the battery won't have a year's worth of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">wear and tear</a>. If it lasts 3 years when you bought it in 2024, it will last three years when you buy it in 2025.</p><p><strong>No big improvements</strong>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank">Moore's law</a> isn't dead, but it's on life support. Before we'll gigantic shift with much faster or more efficient hardware, science has to figure out where to put it and how to do it. It will, but for now, the newer stuff is only incrementally better than the older stuff.</p><p><strong>You don't care about the new features</strong>. You know that a newer model Pixel is going to come with special <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI </a>tricks that older Pixels don't have. Some will never come to last year's model. If you don't care about them, don't pay extra for them.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-to-buy-a-new-model"><span>When to buy a new model</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xtXzTUsdKZZMv5UwYHdTkT" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-back-01" alt="The back of the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xtXzTUsdKZZMv5UwYHdTkT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unless there is a serious manufacturing flaw, you can't go wrong buying the newest model. You'll pay for the privilege, though. Here's when you should buy the newest, and why.</p><p><strong>The price</strong>. Normally, you'll pay more, but big sales events can change that. Decide on a number you're okay with; let's say $150. When the new model is less than $150 more than the older one, go for it.</p><p><strong>Support lifetime</strong>. Every good company now offers multiple years of software support and updates for a new phone. A phone built in 2024 that comes with five years of support reaches end-of-life in 2029. One from 2025 lasts until 2030. If you plan on keeping it around for a while, this matters.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer incentives</strong>. Often, a new model will come with things like a better trade-in policy, a discount on headphones, or even a great deal on other brand-new products like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch</a>. Consider what else you'll be buying, what you have to trade in, and what the total price will be once it's all tallied up.</p><p><strong>New features</strong>. Those Gemini AI tricks I mentioned above? You might really want one or more of them. If the only way you'll ever get them is to buy a new phone, well, you're going to have to do it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-you-re-winning-either-way"><span>You're winning either way</span></h3><p>There is no right or wrong answer for this one, because each of us wants something different. All I can do is tell you what I think and why, using that same Pixel as my example</p><p><strong>Today</strong>, I would buy a Pixel 9 Pro over a Pixel 10 Pro. There are no real differences that matter to me, and I like saving money. That all changes if they are only $100 apart. I'd take the 10 Pro in a minute. Maybe something new will come along that requires the small hardware bump, and I'll have it, and I'll probably be able to find a coupon that saves me money on a charger or something.</p><p>I buy a phone for myself every two years, and I usually buy a model from the year before. This time, I didn't <em><strong>because</strong></em> of a big sale: I got my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">2024 Moto Razr </a>for a few dollars more than the 2023 would have cost me.</p><p>Shopping wisely and doing a bit of research saved me money. It can save you money, too.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9939d19b-5e07-40ea-8e71-baeba2ee80e1">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A well-rounded flagship</strong></em></p><p>Google's Pixel 10 Pro takes the same design from the Pixel 9 Pro and overhauls the internals.

Among its advancements, the OnePlus 15 has been confirmed to feature a massive 7,300mAh Glacier Battery. The Chinese OEM has paired this new battery with its focus on improving the phone's gaming capabilities. OnePlus states this battery is designed to enhance its "ultra-high-frame-rate gaming" experience.</p><p>Of course, with such an expanded capacity, users can game for longer, whether they're playing Zenless Zone Zero or trying to catch Pokémon in Pokémon GO!</p><p>Joining this 7,300mAh battery is a 120W "Super Flash Charger" and a 50W "Wireless Flash Charger."

It's been confirmed that the phone will bring a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 and a 165Hz refresh rate display, which leans into that major gaming focus. It'll also enhance your scrolling and video-watching experience, too.</p><p>Another confirmed aspect is that the OnePlus 15 will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15s-color-lineup-may-omit-a-long-standing-favorite-as-it-gains-a-165hz-refresh-rate">feature three colors</a>: Sand Storm, Absolute Black, and Mist Purple.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Artificial intelligence wants to be everywhere, including on your wrists and in your workouts. Compared to generative AI "slop" like photo and video creation, there's a case to be made for AI infiltrating your workout and fitness plans. Not everyone has access to a personal trainer, sports physician, or physical therapist easily — in fact, few do — and that's why an accurate and accessible AI feature could fill the gap.</p><p>Of course, that puts a lot of pressure on a piece of tech known to be fallible. Anytime your health is involved, you need to be careful what  devices and features you trust. Whether we like it or not, AI is coming for the health space — Garmin, Strava, Apple, Samsung, Google, and many other brands are rolling out AI-powered features now.</p><p>Suunto upgraded its Suunto Coach, an AI-assisted workout helper, to support AI-generated training plans over the summer. I've been testing them with the newly-announced Vertical 2 adventure watch, and I'm intrigued for two reasons. For one, Suunto Coach and My plan are free. Another is that they're actually using AI, which not every workout feature branded as such can claim.</p><p>So, is it any good? Here are my early thoughts after training with the Vertical 2 for two weeks and setting up an AI workout plan.</p><h2 id="setting-up-a-custom-my-plan-with-suunto-coach-2">Setting up a custom My plan with Suunto Coach</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KcwWD3QTwyKy6HFoLXJPf8" name="Suunto-AI-Coach-4" alt="The Suunto Vertical 2 paired with a training plan generated by AI in the Suunto app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcwWD3QTwyKy6HFoLXJPf8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After logging a bunch of running and walking workouts with the Suunto Vertical 2, I went to set up the AI-generated training plan with Suunto Coach. The process starts with a brief questionnaire for context as to your training goals and capabilities.</p><p>Suunto will ask how many hours you are currently training in a week, and then ask your maximum time commitment. You'll have the chance pick a dedicated day for long runs, or state a preference for strength and cross-training workouts. Finally, you'll share your race goal and terrain.</p><p>The questions might vary based on your training plan. I selected the "Get fast for 5km" training plan, as I'm more worried about cutting my 5K time than increasing mileage. I answered the questionnaire accordingly, with my goal being to achieve a personal best on a flat and fast course.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="w2CeMMqzSxDuSi4dfFovQ6" name="Suunto-AI-Coach-Screenshots-1" alt="Screenshots of the Suunto app showing Suunto Coach and My Plan AI features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w2CeMMqzSxDuSi4dfFovQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From there, Suunto will do some AI processing behind the scenes, developing your training plan. This will take a while, often between 10 and 30 minutes. The good news is you only have to do this once for each plan. Using the context based on your answers, Suunto will come up with a personalized training regimen.</p><p>The initial approach reminded me of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">Samsung's Running Coach</a>, a similar feature that includes a brief questionnaire to get a picture of your capabilities. There looks to be more AI processing going on here with Suunto Coach. It takes more time to create a training plan and offers more variety than Running Coach, which is more rigid with fixed time and distance-based running levels.</p><p>That's what intrigues me about Suunto Coach and the AI-generated training plans, which are called "My plan" and are still in beta. For better or worse, they're really using AI. Meanwhile, AI isn't making a meaningful impact on Running Coach or Apple's Workout Buddy. The latter essentially just recites live stats you're already used to seeing on your Apple Watch.</p><h2 id="a-workout-tool-with-potential-and-some-quirks-2">A workout tool with potential, and some quirks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JzF9d4sFHYeahqxzRpEot8" name="Suunto-AI-Coach-3" alt="The Suunto Vertical 2 paired with a training plan generated by AI in the Suunto app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JzF9d4sFHYeahqxzRpEot8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once the training plan generated, I saw immediate potential and a few oddities. The plan does seem personalized and thoughtful, with weekly targets, long-term goals, and instructions specific to individual workouts. It does a fantastic job at taking best practices for running and applying them to a specific plan.</p><p>For instance, my plan included strategic rest days and an easy, low-mileage week that followed each pair of hard training weeks. The 10-week set prescribed six weeks of intense workouts and three weeks of recovery running, including a taper for the final week. It's all designed to maximize performance while also managing miles and avoiding overuse injuries.</p><p>These are well-known running tips and tricks that even experienced runners struggle to implement. It's great to see them in a thorough training plan that takes the strategy off the runner and onto AI.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b7uuEMHfqUsapcosSruxF6" name="Suunto-AI-Coach-Screenshots-2" alt="Screenshots of the Suunto app showing Suunto Coach and My Plan AI features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b7uuEMHfqUsapcosSruxF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, some things could use a tweak. The time, mileage, and pace targets for each workout didn't seem to align with the body of work I had already tracked on the Vertical 2. This leads me to believe the AI brains of Suunto Coach is using the questionnaire more than your prior stats when making a plan. It is supposed to evolve on the fly, and it is still a beta.</p><p>I also found it weird that the AI workout plan randomly inserted a cross-country skiing workout during week eight. I've never cross-country skied, and it's not the easiest sport to try for the first time, so it's an interesting choice.</p><h2 id="suunto-coach-feels-best-as-a-guide-not-a-plan-2">Suunto Coach feels best as a guide, not a plan</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="THbGHVdpVPT4vn8rjFcYn8" name="Suunto-AI-Coach-6" alt="The Suunto Vertical 2 paired with a training plan generated by AI in the Suunto app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THbGHVdpVPT4vn8rjFcYn8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I plan to stick with Suunto Coach, despite the room for improvement. It seems genuinely helpful for training as long as you don't take it too seriously.</p><p>By that, I mean following its recommendations <em>generally</em> and not to the letter. In my case, I'll follow its broad plan for weekly mileage, workout mix, and training load — but avoid hitting an exact mileage or pace target.</p><p>This is a free tool included with Suunto watches, and it'll definitely be handy for the right runner. You just need to take its tips with a grain of salt, just like any AI feature.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="36e4f4f3-1a69-49ff-85eb-13ae5f1b5cd7">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6j4KPd2Q5AUeWzDP9jtBwf.jpg' alt="The Suunto Vertical 2 in a white press render.

It teases that the two main features were developed using "peer-reviewed studies and continuous algorithm refinements." Seeing as Oura is interested in offering Preventive Health assistance daily, the new features begin with "Cumulative Stress."</p><p>Oura states the purpose of this new feature is for users to understand how stress affects their bodies. More specifically, Cumulative Stress will monitor and inform users on how their bodies "respond to chronic stress over time." If left untamed, long-term stress can lead to severe problems, such as fatigue, burnout, and even illness, according to Oura's research.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:646px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.88%;"><img id="YsCuXRoopkxwfxk5hTMVw7" name="oura-app-cumulative-stress-example" alt="Oura is rolling out "Cumulative Stress" and a Stress Management window, informing users about how stressed their bodies are and how it is affecting them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YsCuXRoopkxwfxk5hTMVw7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="646" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Cumulative Stress will also break down where stress is affecting them.

Oura Members participating in this new Blood Pressure Profile Study in Oura Labs will more deeply understand their heart health. The press release details that users can receive alerts if the system detects they're at risk of hypertension.</p><p>This "reading" is a mixture of your Oura Ring data, short questionnaire answers about family history, medication, and lifestyle habits. You'll see an alert about your hypertension risk after answering these questions, which Oura states could fall within any of the following ranges: No signs, Moderate, or Major.</p><p>The Blood Pressure Profile will continue to monitor your body for any changes. Oura adds that this feature "passively" works in the background to detect potential signs of hypertension to educate users about their heart health. If something is there, or something doesn't sit right with you, book an appointment with your doctor. It mentions that, in conjunction with the FDA and following approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Oura aims to detect "early signs" before they become serious.</p><p>This Blood Pressure Profile Study will arrive in Oura Labs for Members in the U.S. "in the coming months."</p><h2 id="cycle-insights-in-app-ui-updates-2">Cycle Insights & in-app UI updates</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:646px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.88%;"><img id="bGqCe3FGdHGZsXMKx2YVw7" name="oura-app-cycle-insights-updates" alt="The Oura app has updated its Cycle Insights to give women a more intuitive view on their periods and fertile windows." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGqCe3FGdHGZsXMKx2YVw7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="646" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oura is rounding out its two major Preventive Health capability updates with an in-app UI overhaul.</p><p>This rework regards the Oura app's Today screen first. The new Today tab will work to better inform users about their well-being before engaging in daily activities and decisions. Oura says the highlight for this new tab is the "One Big Thing," an overview that brings relevant scores, insights, and Discoveries to the surface. Next, the My Health tab has been updated to provide a "clearer view" of their long-term health.</p><p>A new Habits and Routines section is said to "connect daily behaviors to measurable health metrics." Then, there's the Vitals tab, which is an at-a-glance view of your personal core health pillars: sleep, stress, and cardiovascular trends. Users can take a walk through their personal changes, seeing how they've (hopefully) improved in these core areas over the past few days, weeks, months, or even years.</p><p>This UI update isn't only for the app's tabs, but also for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-app-advisor-labs-test-launch">Cycle Insights</a>. This feature is now expanded from one-month insights to a 12-month window about a woman's period and fertile window predictions. This feature is for Oura Members, just as a side note.</p><p>Oura states, "instead of waiting 60 nights, Oura Members will now receive personalized cycle phase and prediction data from a single night of sleep data."</p><p>The Oura app redesign and the updates to Cycle Insights are rolling out globally to users "in the coming weeks" on Android and iOS.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I like what UGREEN is doing with NAS servers; the brand made its debut in this category just a year and a half ago, but it made great momentum thanks to powerful hardware and highly customizable software. Of course, the brand's willingness to allow its customers to eschew its own software and run TrueNAS Scale has endeared it to power users, and this is one of the key reasons why I continue to use the DXP6800 Pro.</p><p>UGREEN is now turning its attention to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-nas">budget NAS</a> category with the introduction of the 2-bay NASync DH2300 and 4-bay NASync DS4300 Plus. The DH2300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nas.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-nasync-dh2300-nas-storage">costs just $189</a>, making it go up against the mighty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds223j-review">DiskStation DS223j</a>. I suggested the DD223j for anyone looking to just get started with NAS servers; it's a great starting point thanks to the affordability and software, and now the DH2300 is proving to be a legitimate alternative.</p><p>The 4-bay DH4300 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Plus-4-Bay-Capacity-Diskless/dp/B0F6CSCSBL/">retails for $364 on Amazon</a>, and it's already seeing decent momentum, becoming the number one release in this category on the retailer — no small feat. Both the DH2300 and DH4300 Plus have a sleeker design than UGREEN's traditional NAS models, and the hardware is better than just about any product in this category.</p><p>The 2-bay DH2300 has Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, and is powered by a Rockchip RK3576. It has 4GB of RAM, which is four times what you get on the DS223j, and there's a 32GB SSD pre-installed that lets you install the software. You get USB-A, USB-C, and HDMI connectivity, and as a starter NAS, there really is a lot to like.</p><p>The 4-bay DH4300 Plus comes with 8GB of RAM, 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, and gets USB-C, USB-A, and HDMI ports. Interestingly, both models accommodate 30TB drives, and I'm using Seagate's 30TB IronWolf Pro drives in each. I'm just getting started with these NAS servers, and I'll share detailed testing notes after using the products for a while.</p><p>But what's of immediate interest is the value; both the DS2300 and DH4300 Plus make it easier than ever to start using a NAS. and the 2-bay DH2300 in particular is turning out to be a standout choice.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="37beb5c7-853e-4b8b-98ef-d274ff864137">            <a href="https://nas.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-nasync-dh2300-nas-storage" data-model-name="UGREEN DH2300" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:108.90%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8cpc5FQsuPzwC3eag3VkR.jpg' alt="UGREEN DH2300"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">UGREEN DH2300</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The DH2300 has a modern design, better hardware than any other entry-level NAS, and great software. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The tri-folding design gives the product a unique edge against regular foldables, and having used the phone for a considerable amount of time, it's astonishing how normal it is in regular use.</p><p>I thought it would be more of a tech demo than an actual product, but that isn't the case at all — the Mate XT is usable as a daily driver, and I've done just that. The fact that the phone unfolds to a tablet-sized panel is just wild, and the novelty doesn't really wear thin.</p><p>With Huawei leading the fray, it isn't astonishing that other brands are looking to get in on the action. Samsung is touted to launch its own take on a tri-folding device dubbed the Galaxy Z TriFold, and with leaks pointing to an imminent release, here's what I want to see in the phone.</p><h2 id="a-design-that-isn-t-cumbersome-2">A design that isn't cumbersome</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hqvbPXLuHvGgwJrev6HmrH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hqvbPXLuHvGgwJrev6HmrH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung did a good job overhauling the design of its foldables with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and I want the tri-folding device to share the same aesthetic. The Z Fold 7 is a delight to hold and use thanks to its sleek design, and it makes a genuine difference over the likes of the Z Fold 6 and its predecessors. It's just as thin and light as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>, and it wasn't until I used the Fold 7 next to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold that I realized how much of a tangible difference there is this year.</p><p>Huawei is no stranger to making sleek devices, and the Mate XT shares this trait; the tri-folding device is just 4.8mm when unfolded, and the thinness is a key factor in the device's futuristic look. Samsung needs to do the same with its tri-folding device. The Z Fold 7 being down to 215g and 4.2mm is a great starting point, and I want Samsung to use its foldable as the starting point and build on that design.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-can-take-on-the-mate-xt-2">Cameras that can take on the Mate XT</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5164px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qNtwC7fk3YmMBKjsEjkD24" name="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Honor Magic V5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Honor Magic V5 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qNtwC7fk3YmMBKjsEjkD24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5164" height="2909" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung gave the Z Fold 7 a much-needed 200MP camera upgrade this year, allowing the foldable to take much better photos and videos. The Galaxy Z TriFold needs to have the same cameras if it needs to measure up to not just Samsung, but other foldables.</p><p>While I wasn't sure about what Huawei had to offer on the Mate XT, the cameras on the tri-folding device proved to be among the best in this category. The Mate XT continues to take standout photos and videos, and I never got the feeling that I'm being limited by the cameras on the device.</p><p>Although foldables are all about the added real estate, the fact that the Galaxy Z TriFold might cost over $3,000 means it needs to have stellar cameras — no two ways about it. Samsung has shown that it can deliver in this area this year, and we'll just need to wait and see if it manages to do the same with its tri-folding device.</p><h2 id="a-battery-that-lasts-all-day-2">A battery that lasts all day</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPwdZLE3cG4t92cKu8jKsH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPwdZLE3cG4t92cKu8jKsH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot I like about the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but a constant source of frustration is the battery life. The foldable has a smaller 4,400mAh battery, and while it manages to last a day with medium use, I find myself plugging it in before the end of the day on most days.</p><p>Most other foldables get at least a 5,000mAh battery, with Samsung being the outlier in how conservative it is in this area — even Google decided to slot in a bigger 5,015mAh battery on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold this year. All of this is to say that the Galaxy Z TriFold needs to have a bigger battery to hold its own against the Mate XT.</p><p>However, that may not be the case; leaks indicate that the tri-folding device may share the same 4,400mAh battery as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and if that turns out to be the case, it will be a letdown.</p><h2 id="a-foldable-i-actually-want-to-use-2">A foldable I actually want to use</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4934px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qf2VtskxzfjTtotBpTJGAT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qf2VtskxzfjTtotBpTJGAT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4934" height="2775" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another annoyance on the Z Fold 7 is just how much it wobbles when using it on a table. Because of the thinner design and the switch to bigger camera sensors, the rear cameras jut out a bit more than previous years, and with Samsung not changing the positioning of the modules, the foldable wobbles quite a lot.</p><p>Huawei and other Chinese brands mitigate this issue by using a center-mounted camera island, and Samsung needs to consider doing the same. It isn't likely that the design of the Z TriFold will diverge that much from the Z Fold 7, but even if that isn't the case, I want a phone that I can use on my desk without it constantly moving around.</p><h2 id="meaningful-software-2">Meaningful software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3753px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RMNDvmktqEKg6KJJmdmRuS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-15" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMNDvmktqEKg6KJJmdmRuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3753" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is doing a great job with foldable software in general, and I want to see how it utilizes the tablet-sized panel available on a tri-folding device. I'm ambivalent towards Galaxy AI, but I'll admit that Samsung is doing the right thing in highlighting what its AI suite can do front and center — unlike the Easter egg hunt that Google makes you do on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>I'm keen on seeing if any additional multi-tasking features make their way to the Z TriFold. Outside of that, I just want software that's easy to use, and has decent customizability.</p><p>A key reason why Samsung continues to dominate the foldable category is available — its phones are sold in more countries than any of its rivals.

Plenty of fitness watch fans detest this trend, like my 955-wearing brother-in-law. While I'll admit I prefer AMOLED displays, the APEX 4 is a <em>great</em> watch for the holdouts.</p><p>COROS's last watch, the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-nomad-3-has-impressed-me-as-fun-garmin-instinct-3-rival"> NOMAD</a>, challenges the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Garmin Instinct 3</a> in a narrow category: affordable, rugged hiking watches with weeks of battery life. An MIP display felt like the right fit.</p><p>The APEX 4 targets trail runners and "mountain athletes" who also care about battery life and outdoor visibility. But its $429/479 price gives it stiffer competition from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-2-hands-on-accuracy-test">Suunto Race 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Garmin Forerunner 570</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a> — all AMOLED watches, and the first two with 2,000 nits for excellent readability in direct sunlight.</p><h2 id="initial-thoughts-2">Initial thoughts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="c6K45y7UcyB6HYFBTLRQYn" name="COROS-APEX-4-vs-NOMAD-displays" alt="Photo of the COROS NOMAD (left) and APEX 4 (right) both sitting on a flat surface.

The hardware impressed me, especially the epic battery life, but I could tell that the GPS and HR accuracy could be better, the health tracking and software had plenty of gaps, and the MIP displays were painfully dim.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the APEX 4 is more reliably accurate (as you'll see below), the battery life still blows me away, and the MIP display has much better contrast, making it serviceable — though for whatever reason, the NOMAD's display is <em>more</em> readable indoors. I think the APEX 4's sapphire layer catches more obscuring light.</p><p>Most importantly, the APEX 4's new Ambiq Apollo 510 processor powers the speediest, smoothest maps I've seen outside of Apple and Wear OS watches, where most fitness watch rivals like Garmin are laggy. You now get street and trail names, and the crown makes it seamless to zoom in to a confusing trail turn or out to a wider view in a couple of seconds.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rp8VdRsM9wWfyQD3wd2kcM" name="COROS-APEX-4-follow-course-hiking" alt="A photo of the COROS APEX 4 on the author's wrist showing a topographic map with turn-by-turn navigation and a course line." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rp8VdRsM9wWfyQD3wd2kcM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mG9gnmoRP8C73TWzhNBNcM" name="COROS-APEX-4-off-route-warning" alt="A photo of the COROS APEX 4 on the author's wrist showing a topographic map with turn-by-turn navigation and a red "Off route" pop-up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mG9gnmoRP8C73TWzhNBNcM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>My only complaints are with the turn-by-turn navigation for downloaded courses. It mostly works without issue, but I noticed twice that when I came to a loop, the arrow suggested I go in the opposite direction that I chose when I made the course.</p><p>When I intentionally went off course, the APEX 4 caught it and warned me immediately. But the turn-by-turn directions don't update based on which direction you're facing, so when I missed my right turn and turned around, it still told me to turn right. I hope COROS can address both of my map nitpicks in the future.</p><p>With its new processor, the APEX 4 is primed for years of upgrades. Over three years, the APEX 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/20087492454932-COROS-APEX-2-Pro-Release-Notes">added</a> HRV and stress data, sleep quality, and running form analysis, Strava Live Segments, and safety alerts, among dozens of new features. While Garmin watch updates tend to dry up after 1–2 years, APEX 4 updates should last much longer.</p><p>I specifically expect its built-in depth gauge sensor to enable scuba diving at some point, and COROS told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1C3gOwMx64&t=1075s">Chase the Summit</a> that it may use the mic & speaker to enable offline voice commands in the future.</p><h2 id="coros-apex-4-gps-accuracy-2">COROS APEX 4 GPS accuracy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="FoRKEYou9JEAdNGFBctTVn" name="COROS-APEX-4-satellites" alt="A COROS APEX 4 sitting on a wooden table showing all the nearby satellite signals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FoRKEYou9JEAdNGFBctTVn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">All the nearby satellite signals </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not all dual-band GPS watches are created equal. Having tested nearly every smartwatch brand's GPS accuracy, I've found that COROS's most recent watches come the closest to Garmin for dependability, with the APEX 4 following that pattern. Get ready for some boringly straight GPS lines, with only a couple of glitches to speak of.</p><p>I took three dual-frequency GPS watches — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a>, and APEX 4 — out for a 19-mile run; while Google depends mainly on L1 and L5 GPS frequencies, Garmin and COROS also pull in other GNSS signals as needed.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

However, Garmin kept the Elevate sensor mostly the same, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. As we've seen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>, this sensor manages to be quite accurate.</p><p>I've been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-4-makes-major-changes-to-garmins-health-and-fitness-coaching-and-were-intrigued">Garmin Venu 4</a> for a couple of weeks as my main workout wearable. I've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-3">compared it to the Garmin Venu 3</a> to see how things have changed (if at all), and against the Pixel Watch 3 to see how it stacks up against my favorite smartwatch.</p><h2 id="fitness-features-i-love-2">Fitness features I love</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="4QLHohUHhQv4xGV3awrwpZ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-7" alt="Garmin Venu 4 Training Readiness screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QLHohUHhQv4xGV3awrwpZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the Forerunner series, the Garmin Venu 4 is more of an all-rounder, meaning there's an overall focus on fitness, not just running. Therefore, Garmin has stuffed a bunch of fitness features into the watch, building on top of previous models while making it ideal for anyone to strap one on and just go.</p><p>There are plenty of useful and new training features to help you get the most out of your workouts, but the one I pay most attention to is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/training-readiness/">Training Readiness</a>. This takes into account various factors, including sleep, recovery time, and acute load, to determine how hard you should push yourself in upcoming workouts. In theory, this is a good way to avoid overexerting yourself, which can negatively affect your performance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3843px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="yW2W9B9uJbJHHLdScsS9MZ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-4" alt="Garmin Venu 4 fitness coach" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yW2W9B9uJbJHHLdScsS9MZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3843" height="2162" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu 4 also supports more coaching, which has allowed me to experience a better mix of workouts to change up my normal routine. This feels much more tailored and varied, and fans of the Venu series should find this useful. Weightlifters such as myself will also enjoy the watch's ability to count reps and sets more accurately than even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>, which translates to more accurate exercise and muscle categorization in post-workout stats.</p><p>You'll also receive more varied suggested workouts if you don't have a coaching plan enabled, which is a nice evolution of the Morning Report on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3897px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c4sg2Mfh6EiQJPu7si4ZuZ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-3" alt="Garmin Venu 4 Training effect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4sg2Mfh6EiQJPu7si4ZuZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3897" height="2192" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After each workout, the Venu 4 provides a summary of the activity, which includes metrics like training load, which gauges the intensity of your workout. You'll also see a number that indicates your recovery time, which directly affects your training readiness. This is basically your downtime between strenuous activities, including sleep. It's Garmin's way of telling you to chill.</p><h2 id="heart-rate-2">Heart rate</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3980px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ts87jSr7SSJHgdejoggWTZ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-2" alt="Garmin Venu 4 post-workout benefit screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ts87jSr7SSJHgdejoggWTZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3980" height="2239" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As heart rate sensors, smartwatches are fairly reliable, but ultimately, they're imperfect. How well the watch detects your heart rate can depend on a number of things, including the fit, placement, cleanliness, and even the type of band. And while Garmin's Elevate V5 heart rate monitor on the Venu 4 has proven itself over the years, it's not infallible.</p><p>In most cases, the Venu 4 appeared to be in line with expectations during my workouts. I've been working out with smartwatches long enough to know roughly what the readings should be. However, there are times when I'll notice that the watch will take a moment to actually get there, as you can see in the charts below:</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.38%;"><img id="MitTFAEZReU52yL2d2NgRf" name="Garmin-Venu-4-vs-google-Pixel-Watch-3-heart-rate-1" alt="Heart rate chart comparison between the Garmin Venu 4 and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MitTFAEZReU52yL2d2NgRf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1488" height="824" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Venu 4 (purple) and Pixel Watch 3 (red) heart rate chart. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.38%;"><img id="9LBUp5WtVWzNcu9X4wLgRf" name="Garmin-Venu-4-vs-google-Pixel-Watch-3-heart-rate-3" alt="Heart rate chart comparison between the Garmin Venu 4 and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LBUp5WtVWzNcu9X4wLgRf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1488" height="824" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Venu 4 (purple) and Pixel Watch 3 (red) heart rate chart. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.38%;"><img id="oviPUkP6ctawFutGrtoRUf" name="Garmin-Venu-4-vs-google-Pixel-Watch-3-heart-rate-2" alt="Heart rate chart comparison between the Garmin Venu 4 and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oviPUkP6ctawFutGrtoRUf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1488" height="824" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Venu 4 (red) and Pixel Watch 3 (purple) heart rate chart. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As you can see in the first chart, the Venu 4 stayed well below the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> during my run. I noticed this in real-time, and couldn't determine why the readings were so off, as both watches were fit snugly on my wrists. Fortunately, the watch appeared to correct itself once my pace quickened, but it definitely threw me off during my run.</p><p>Subsequent runs did not appear to have any major discrepancies, and both watches were mostly in line with each other.

Apple does the same thing every year, as does Google. Customers want high-powered charging, and many companies aren't giving it.</p><p>But that's not what we <em>really</em> need.</p><h2 id="all-day-should-mean-something-2">"All day" should mean something</h2><p>I know I'm in the minority here, but the one thing I want from recharging a battery isn't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-supervooc">high speed</a> that relies on everything going right. I want to be able to plug it in and feel sure that it's going to safely do what it's supposed to do.</p><p>That doesn't mean I'm fine with having my phone tied to a cord for 90 minutes every afternoon, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="ujHAP67LKJnuYvEa5XsH3b" name="google-pixel-6-batterywidget.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 battery widget" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ujHAP67LKJnuYvEa5XsH3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2535" height="1425" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The reason we want faster charging is simple: our phones' batteries don't last nearly long enough between charges. I don't mean some tired phone with a worn-out battery, either; brand new phones don't give the advertised battery life for many folks who use them differently than the people making the promises do.</p><p>I'm not saying that companies are lying. They simply make sure everything is perfect when they determine the average battery life, and nothing is perfect once you step into reality. They are throwing out a number even though they know it is inaccurate for most people anyway, though.</p><p>If your phone lasted from morning until you went to bed, you could plug it in, let it charge nice and slowly (and safer) all night, and do it all over again the next day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ysd3QpE3YGmKqTaovSh3qS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ysd3QpE3YGmKqTaovSh3qS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know it's possible, and you probably do, too. Look at those "cheap" phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G,</a> for example. They almost always have one thing in common: a battery that's big enough. That doesn't mean gargantuan, either; the Moto G has a 5,000mAh battery that's enough to run the phone until you put it down instead of it telling you it needs to rest. Other phones do even better, but I don't think we're at "real" two-day battery life just yet.</p><h2 id="a-problem-that-can-be-fixed-2">A problem that can be fixed</h2><p>Some phone makers — I'll use OnePlus as an example here — know that something needs to be done. The solution was to engineer a way to charge the phone at unsafe power levels that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-teases-65w-warp-charge-oneplus-8t">have been made safe</a>. It works, and it is safe. Until it isn't. There are a lot of bits of tiny hardware and software needed to make it work, and when something goes wrong, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-what-makes-a-phone-battery-go-haywire-and-explode">bad things can happen</a>. At least they're doing <em>something</em>, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.56%;"><img id="AMv7CcSWWWkbadiG4J7c29" name="App battery usage PIxel Phone.jpg" alt="App battery usage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMv7CcSWWWkbadiG4J7c29.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3062" height="1732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead of trying something new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">like Honor did</a> when it comes to the battery, companies like Samsung and Apple are worrying about making phones thinner and batteries smaller. A lot of people like a thin phone, but how many are willing to charge twice a day for it? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-reportedly-cancels-plans-for-galaxy-s26-edge-heres-why-im-not-surprised">Not very many</a>, it seems.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-solid-state-battery-toyota-dyson/" target="_blank">Solid-state batteries</a> are an instant fix, and that's why you'll find them in something like a pacemaker. They have a ton of capacity without being any bigger, are safer, and provide higher output at low battery levels. They're still lithium-based, but solid electrolytes like ceramics don't explode when they get hot.</p><p>The problem is that they are expensive. The thing that makes a phone maker happiest is being able to use less money to build something and then charge you more for it. Solid-state batteries would cut into that profit margin, so don't hold your breath. A company has to make money if it wants to survive.</p><h2 id="in-a-perfect-world-2">In a perfect world</h2><p>To me, a perfect phone would be reasonable in size (nobody wants an inch-thick phone), do everything I need it to do, and not need to be charged until I'm done with it for the day. You and I probably do different things and live in different places, but I'll bet that sounds perfect to you, too.</p><p>I'm all for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/youre-using-ai-all-the-time-and-might-not-even-know-it">new software ideas</a> and ways to use less battery to do "stuff." Exploring ways to i<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-supervooc">ncrease power and voltage in a charging circuit</a> is really cool, too. I just hope these companies don't think they have the battery life problem solved.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to Vats, Samsung is preparing to roll out a "new album art transition effect" on your lock screen when tapping the "skip" button.</p><p>In the video, the media player's widget at the bottom looks relatively the same as it is currently in One UI 8. However, what hogs the spotlight is a rather large area reserved for the song's album cover.</p><p>Instead of detailing what song and artist are playing in the media control widget, the cover takes care of that. The album art sits prominently in the center of the lock screen, and beneath that are your core details: song title, artist, and/or featured artists. When switching songs, the album art will change accordingly, though there is a small delay between the user's interaction and the software recognizing the change.</p><p>The transition effect is quite refined, as new album covers emerge from the remains of the other. In the clip, Vats is using their Spotify songs to get this to work. It's not clear how far Samsung's support will go if this makes it to One UI 8.5's live launch. But perhaps we can expect support for YouTube Music, Pandora, and more, too.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-putting-in-the-work-2">Samsung's putting in the work</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One UI 8.5: New feature 👀Media player now adds a new album art transition effect 🎶 pic.twitter.com/OsNCzccPUN<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1979076734919283190">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Older rumors have speculated that One UI 8.5 could hold even more advancements for Samsung's software over a smaller 0.1 version patch. This seems to be the case, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-automatic-call-screen-samsung-phones">a recent report claims</a> Samsung is working on a Pixel-like calling feature for Galaxy phones. Rumors say the company is looking to develop a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screen</a> feature that uses AI to run its major processes. Such processes include call transcription, spam filtering for unknown callers/spam calls, and automatic answering.</p><p>It was suggested that users could have varying "screening levels." If at the highest, your device would act as more of a defensive bastion, blocking out most things. If lighter, then there's more leeway.</p><p>All we have are these little tidbits, as Samsung's testing things internally on its servers; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/ui-8-5-beta-program-for-samsung-galaxy-late-this-fall-rumored">eager Galaxy users could get their chance</a>, too.

Android Central's Nick Sutrich says that this year's OxygenOS 16 "offers users plenty of UI customization options and focuses intensely on the beautification of the entire experience."</p><p>The new OS is said to be so "smooth" and gives users many ways to customize their lock screen and app drawer with animations. It introduces the "Flux Theme 2.0," which lets you personalize your wallpaper with moving photos and videos, including cool 3D effects that react to you.</p><p>It also seamlessly works with OnePlus' AI and Gemini, providing the user with a more intuitive experience that feels like having a personal assistant in your pocket.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-project-moohan-looks-set-to-launch-this-month-2">Samsung's Project Moohan looks set to launch this month</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qfNMCReBpfL3vqwVLooUse" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-3" alt="Michael Hicks testing Android XR on Samsung Project Moohan at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfNMCReBpfL3vqwVLooUse.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3024" height="1701" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-worlds-wide-open-event-for-its-xr-project-moohan"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>The wait might be finally over as Samsung is set to host another virtual Galaxy event to unveil its new AI-focused devices as well as Android's XR platform.</p><p>In a press release to Android Central, Samsung said that users should prepare for the Galaxy event "Worlds Wide Open." This event is set to take place next week on October 21 at 10 pm ET (7 pm PT). It will be streamed on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=47773&u1=ac-ca-1191897934401670748&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Samsung's main site</a>, as well as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.

Zack Nelson, the host of the 'JerryRigEverything' channel on YouTube, put the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> through his infamous durability test. And things got pretty ugly, with Google's latest Fold pretty much exploding and smoking during the bend test.</p><p>Here's what happened: the first time he bent the device in reverse, it pretty much snapped in half at the antenna lines on top. However, when he tried to bend the device further, the battery almost instantly gave out and began smoking.</p><p>According to Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand, this was caused by something called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-what-makes-a-phone-battery-go-haywire-and-explode">thermal runaway</a>. It occurs when something causes a spot in the battery to heat up, such as the excessive pressure from the bend test. Which created "a self-sustaining chain reaction that heats adjacent spots until everything becomes hot enough to burn."</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-may-be-gone-for-good-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge may be gone for good</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.93%;"><img id="unZnRYwhUK29vb85wttHVZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-4" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/unZnRYwhUK29vb85wttHVZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1938" height="1084" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>The word on the street is that Samsung has reportedly cancelled its Edge variant, as its predecessor didn't fare well in the market. According to recent reports, people weren't as interested in buying the ultra-slim <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> due to several underlying reasons. While we don't know for sure what caused it, we assume that its hefty price tag and the battery capacity could've pushed for this to happen.</p><p>This has led Samsung to reportedly cut production and offer heavy discounts on the device. Which means we won't be seeing it in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> lineup, as a Samsung executive said that the slim Edge line is unlikely to return. This means that there may not be a line-up reshuffle after all, and that Samsung could be sticking to its usual base, Plus, and Ultra trio.</p><h2 id="android-16-qpr2-beta-3-landed-but-was-pulled-back-2">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 landed, but was pulled back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="Xdy5WEPLCQHCE6SGDUNaAX" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xdy5WEPLCQHCE6SGDUNaAX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2408" height="1032" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr2-beta-3-changes"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Android 16's next beta just about landed before it was pulled from the servers due to a boot loop issue.

While this isn't a new feature, Google has just made it easier to create a shortcut with a "+" button beside each shortcut, making it more obvious that they can be pinned to the home screen.</p><p>Some smaller tweaks include a Live Caption shortcut that has been added directly to the volume control menu, and the icons for the microphone, Google Lens, and AI Mode in the home screen search bar are now slightly larger for better visibility.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> are first on the list to receive the OxygenOS 16 update in November, which includes the 13R, 13s, and the 12R. However, the company states that its OnePlus Open, Pad 3, and Pad 2 are on deck for next month, too.</p><p>December is when the software starts rolling out for several past-gen models. Owners of a OnePlus 11 5G, 11R 5G, Nord 5, Nord CE5, Nord 4, and Nord 3 5G should receive the patch sometime in December.</p><p>Even more devices are slated for OxygenOS 16, but OnePlus is a little more vague. The following models aren't set to receive the update until Q1 2026, which can be anywhere from January to March, so be aware.</p><ul><li>OnePlus 10 Pro 5G</li><li>OnePlus Nord CE4</li><li>OnePlus Nord NE 4 Lite 5G</li><li>OnePlus Pad</li><li>OnePlus Pad Lite</li></ul><h2 id="new-os-time-s-are-crazy-2">New OS time's are crazy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yPYHWk4evMnodZmmxtkYvF" name="oneplus-oxygenos-16-official-infographic" alt="The official infographic from OnePlus showing the main updates in OxygenOS 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yPYHWk4evMnodZmmxtkYvF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus has delivered a warning, informing users that not everyone will see its update simultaneously. It states that OxygenOS 16 is rolling out in "batches," meaning some users in some countries could see it in the first week of November, while others may see it in the third week (just as an example). Keep your eyes peeled for more updates, and, the more likely scenario, an alert on your OnePlus phone/tablet.</p><p>OxygenOS 16 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">launched just yesterday</a>, and users were treated to software that truly knows them. Quickly getting the Apple iOS references out, OxygenOS 16 offers a revamped AI experience that is focused on personalizing your device through "intelligent data interactions." Users will find tools like AI Writer and AI Scan to help make mundane tasks a little easier.</p><p>There's also Plus Mind, which is an AI-centric place on your device for housing your screenshots about locations, dates, and more. The AI will offer suggestions for you based on those screenshots to help you make plans, trips, or even dinner.</p><p>Speaking of Plus Mind, OnePlus' Mind Space got a huge update during OxygenOS 16, one that brings Gemini into the mix. Users can connect Mind Space to Gemini and let the AI dig through their stored screenshots to help them with any queries they may have. It works like Gemini's Extensions for YouTube, Spotify, and more Workspace apps.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As a result, users in Korea can no longer download or reinstall the software.</p><p>What makes this even more interesting is that this isn’t an isolated incident. A few days ago, Samsung also halted the same One UI 8 update for the Galaxy S22 lineup <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s22-android-16-update">a week after its rollout</a>. That earlier rollback hinted that something was off with Samsung’s latest software build, and now, with the S24 series facing the same pause, it’s clear the issue might run deeper than expected.</p><p>According to reports on X, Samsung also pulled the firmware for the Galaxy S24 FE.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Attention Galaxy S24 users ❗️Samsung has pulled One UI 8 build from the OTA server Korea 🇰🇷 👀S24 series:CYI9 (OneUI8) ➡️ BYG8 (OneUI7) S24Fe:CYI9 (OneUI8) ➡️ BYG2 (OneUI7)#Samsung #OneUI8 #GalaxyS24 #GalaxyS24fe pic.twitter.com/H2csnVBbA9<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1979111658271240450">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><h2 id="no-major-user-complaints-for-now-2">No major user complaints (for now)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R58kspU9haSWsVA2tVErqh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-camera-lenses-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the smaller Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R58kspU9haSWsVA2tVErqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is surprising that users who have already installed the update have not reported major bugs or widespread issues. That makes this sudden halt even more surprising, as it seems Samsung’s decision was preemptive rather than reactive. The company might be dealing with a subtle underlying glitch or a problem that only appears under certain regional configurations or carrier settings.</p><p>Interestingly, the suspension appears to affect only the Korean market for now. The One UI 8 update remains available in other regions, at least as of this writing, and it's unclear whether the rollback could expand to other regions.</p><p>Still, the delay might hint that Samsung is rechecking its regional firmware builds before pushing them further. It’s also worth noting that the One UI 8 rollout for the Galaxy S22 series in Korea still hasn’t resumed.</p><p>For now, S24 owners in Korea who already installed One UI 8 can continue using it without problems, but those who haven’t yet updated are stuck waiting for Samsung’s next move.</p><p>The company hasn’t made any public statement about the reason behind the halt, but given its recent pattern, it’s likely working on a fixed or patched version of the firmware.</p> ]]></dc:content>
