I've taken trips with and without my DSLR camera, some with just a tablet, some with a VR headset alongside a mouse and keyboard, and others with just a phone in my pocket. Each of these setups is good for different types of trips, but what about the times you need a little bit of everything?</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-nearby-share-your-android-phone">Android Quick Share</a> finally made file transfer a breeze, enabling extremely fast, one-tap transfer between Android devices, Windows devices, or both. I regularly pass files between my Windows-based laptop and any number of Android phones in my possession, and it's made my life and job so much easier.</p><p>But what about sharing screens or even transferring mouse and keyboard input between devices? That's a lot harder, but some companies have created ecosystems that work well with each other in a nearly seamless way. People have stuck with Apple for this reason, and now a few Android companies have finally caught up, offering easy cross-device connectivity between phones, laptops, and tablets, all without having to download extra apps or paid services to get the job done.</p><p>I'm going to highlight what I think are the three best interconnectivity solutions available on Android today, all of which work a little differently and have a slightly different scope.</p>
<h2 id="hello-moto-2">Hello Moto</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xc68iwyFXVZW5R58FmJt93" name="Smart-Connect-new-dashboard" alt="Smart Connect new update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xc68iwyFXVZW5R58FmJt93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of all the available solutions, Motorola takes the cake for device simplicity. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Motorola Smart Connect</a> just requires you to have a Motorola phone or tablet, and the rest falls right in line. It requires the most setup of the three ecosystems I talk about today, but that's because you can use any Windows-based laptop to connect your phone or tablet as if they were one big, cohesive device.</p><p>Once you've got the Motorola Smart Connect software installed on your computer, pairing it with your Motorola smartphone or Lenovo tablet is just a QR code scan away. From there, all linked devices will share a clipboard and have easy file transfer. You can even pull up your phone or tablet's storage on your PC as if it were a USB drive.</p><p>What's particularly cool is that you can run individual phone apps on your PC, letting you multitask your favorite idle clicker game alongside those work spreadsheets, all without having to touch the phone. Motorola lets you control your phone or tablet with the same mouse and keyboard as your PC. So they feel like an extra monitor instead of separate devices running different operating systems. Plus, you can use your phone's camera as a webcam for any meeting, which could come in handy in several scenarios.</p>

<p>Samsung makes a lot of electronics. From washing machines to TVs and refrigerators to smartphones and tablets, the company does an impeccable job of cohesively connecting all these devices. Samsung smart home devices work with non-Samsung phones and computers via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/samsung-smartthings-home-insight-edge-ai-detailed" target="_blank">SmartThings</a> app, but for the scope of this article, interconnectivity between your phone, tablet, and laptop all have to be between Samsung Galaxy products.</p><p>It's easy to share your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>'s screen with a Samsung TV by tapping "share screen" in the notification shade. Moving windows and apps between a Samsung tablet and phone just requires you to enable multi-control. And if you're lucky enough to have a Samsung Galaxybook laptop, you can even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-multi-control-with-samsung-galaxy-devices">share your Samsung GalaxyBook's keyboard with your phone</a>.</p><p>You can also transfer files between devices by using familiar interfaces — either the share dialog on an Android device or File Explorer on Windows — as well as share clipboards between devices. There are few things handier than copying a link on your phone and being able to instantly paste it somewhere on your PC.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> has been around for the better part of a decade and provides an easy way to use your phone like a laptop, letting you hook it up via USB-C cable to any monitor to project UI that looks and works exactly like a PC. Samsung hasn't done much with DeX in a while but it still works well for those times when you need better multitasking and don't have a laptop around to do it.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-been-an-honor-2">It's been an Honor</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="upBPyueXd57EZQeeeXRx6C" name="Honor-Magic-Ring-01" alt="Connecting an Honor Pad V9 to the Honor MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon laptop via Honor Magic Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/upBPyueXd57EZQeeeXRx6C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But while I really like all the interconnectivity from Samsung, there's still a bit of setup that's required to get everything working together. Honor's Magic Ring, the company's oddly named interconnectivity solution, automatically recognizes and enables connectivity between any Honor device around it that's signed into the same Honor account.</p><p>Magic Ring is a centralized connectivity suite that shows all adjacent devices with all potential actions available for each. The same UI is found on every device with Magic Ring support — Honor tablets, phones, and laptops — so there's no misunderstanding about what devices support which functions.</p><p>If I tap the laptop icon, I can tap either screen sharing or input sharing, then tap the accompanying device to perform that action. In the case of my most recent work trip, tapping screen share and then tapping the tablet icon gave me an instant second monitor I could use while working from my hotel room.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eyzZXofq6RgqZvQMDjrh3C" name="Honor-Magic-Ring-03" alt="Connecting an Honor Pad V9 to the Honor MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon laptop via Honor Magic Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eyzZXofq6RgqZvQMDjrh3C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, tapping the icon for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro </a>smartphone or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-pad-v9-review">Honor Pad V9</a> tablet gives me additional options like taking a picture and instantly sharing the photo to my laptop.</p><p>Magic Ring was also <em>vital</em> to my job during Hurricane Helene last Fall when I had no home internet for a month. I didn't want to pay T-Mobile for an unlimited hotspot package, and Magic Ring let me run my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> foldable in split-screen on my tablet so I could quickly transfer files and browse the web from the larger screen.</p><p>Aside from great interconnectivity, Honor's devices are also a lot better for me to use because of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>.</p>
<h2 id="staying-connected-is-vital-2">Staying connected is vital</h2>

<p>Interconnectivity between devices is more than a gimmick or convenience. It's a huge part of what makes device ecosystems better than others and why people often choose to use Samsung or Honor devices over some other Android manufacturers.</p><p>These companies aren't alone in offering interconnectivity — OnePlus, for instance, offers auto-connect capabilities between devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> — but Honor and Samsung offer more devices than most other Android manufacturers, making their interconnectivity solutions a bit more valuable.</p><p>The recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Honor Alpha Plan</a> aims to go beyond current offerings by extending interconnectivity to all devices — not just ones made by Honor — including iPhones and other non-Android devices by utilizing the power of AI.</p><p>It remains to be seen just how well this works, but it's exciting to see interconnectivity continuing to be pushed. Who knows, Honor's model may eventually become ubiquitous in smart device connectivity the way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> is with smart home connectivity.</p>

<hr>
<p>Pixel 9a leaks keep on giving. This time, the phone was not just spotted but also seen in action. A leaker took the alleged Pixel 9a to the Lucha Libre match — a wrestling match in Mexico City — where they were seen filming the event with the device (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/pixel-9a-leak-shows-off-camera/">as first spotted by 9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qlJdTW62nOc">video</a> of the leak was posted on YouTube Shorts, and the tipster seems to be holding the alleged device in a black colorway. They first show off all the angles of the phone and then proceed to film the match with it as well.</p><p>First, the Pixel 9a seems to be held against a bag of snacks, showcasing the size of the device, which we expect to be 154mm tall and 73mm wide. After that, the leaker flips around the phone, showing us the rounded corners and the almost flat rear panel with the signature "G" logo and the camera array. As previous leaks have indicated, the phone may see an overall flatter look with its rear panel, ditching its usual camera bump for a pill-shaped horizontal camera casing that sort of integrates the lens into the back panel of the device.</p><p>Furthermore, the phone is speculated to have two cameras on the back: a 48 MP primary lens and a 13MP ultrawide one. Which is what the leaker seems to be filming the Lucha Libre match with.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qlJdTW62nOc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The supposed Pixel 9a was only showcased in the first few seconds of the video; after that, the leaker proceeded to film the match. The publication further notes that the leaker claimed to be filming with the device, showcasing the phone's zoom capabilities, as seen in the video above.</p><p>However, it remains unclear if all the shots were taken by the alleged Pixel 9a that was showcased at the start. While most of the details check out with the previous leaks, it remains to be seen how the actual device would turn out. Rumors suggest that Google's new mid-ranger will launch sometime in March, but it could also appear at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O in May this year</a>.

<ul><li>Disney Plus is trying to build interest for Andor Season 2, but it's doing so on YouTube in a way that's not just an ad run.</li><li>The first three episodes of Andor Season 1 are available on YouTube for viewers to watch, alongside a Season 1 recap.</li><li>Andor Season 2 will premier on Disney Plus on April 22.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Disney makes an interesting move to get more people excited about the second season of Andor.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tv/626966/andors-first-three-episodes-are-streaming-on-youtube">The Verge</a>, Disney Plus' original Star Wars show, Andor, has headed for YouTube to promote its upcoming second season. Instead of running what you'd expect: ads, the company is looking to grab the viewer's attention by dropping some of the first season on the platform — for free.</p><p>Disney started posting the videos on YouTube yesterday (Mar 10). All of the content is there, with the episodes running 39 mins, 35 mins, and 40 mins, respectively, for the first three. The streaming service has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL148kCvXk8pARjuC9IHQUH3YpHeW8UzP_">created a neat playlist</a> for users who'd like to binge these episodes for a little while.</p><p>What's more, if Disney has captivated you enough to head over to its platform and watch the rest (or Hulu as the post notes), there is a Season 1 recap video available. This video runs for roughly 15 minutes and hits you with everything you should keep in mind before the next run begins.</p><p>The publication highlights Andor's creator, Tony Gilroy, is preparing to host an hour-long "rewatch event" on YouTube on March 13.</p><p>Andor Season 2 will begin on April 22 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>.</p>

<p>There's no getting around the fact that Disney Plus started enforcing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-paid-sharing-enforced-us-launch">paid sharing program</a> in the U.S. last September. Similar to what we've seen others do (Netflix), Disney Plus is letting subscribers add an "extra member" to their <em>household </em>account. Those with the Basic Plan can do so for an extra $6.99. Others who've purchased the Premium variant will see an additional $9.99 charge.</p><p>These were all things <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-explores-password-sharing-crackdown">talked about prior</a>, but Disney's CEO Bob Iger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown-begins-june-2024">confirmed</a> its arrival last spring. To quote Iger, he stated a couple of years back that he wanted "Disney Plus to become a growth business for Disney and that effort appears to be starting with new password-sharing initiatives."</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.disneyplus.com/news/next-on-disney-plus-march-2025">March is packed</a> with new things coming to Disney Plus, like the resurgence of a popular Marvel character through Daredevil: Born Again. The show kicked off on March 4 with a two-episode season premier and continues today (Mar 11) with episode three. Moana 2 is set for its streaming debut on March 12 alongside even more content for Hulu and ESPN Plus subscribers.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out several Gemini-backed features for its Workspace Business and Enterprise edition (Standard and Plus) users.</li><li>Meet grabs a new "Studio" feature dubbed "Studio Look" for camera clarity while Google Chat brings its in-app translation ability to more users.</li><li>The company recently brought a Gemini-powered side panel addition to Gmail, which lets users quickly add events to calendar from emails.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google continues to spread Gemini's influence across its Workspace suite of apps, and its latest update brings it to its communication sector.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/more-ai-powered-features-for-google-workspace-business-and-enterprise-editions.html">posted</a> another set of patch notes for how Gemini will enhance the Workspace experience for Business and Enterprise editions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/gemini-google-meet-chat-workspace/">9to5Google</a>). The update rolling out today (Mar. 11) concerns users with those editions who frequently use apps like Meet and Chat. The former is on the receiving end of the most Gemini enhancements this week as Google states Meet will pick up a new "Studio" feature addition.</p><p>Joining Google Meet will be Gemini's ability to "detect and enhance" the look of your portrait during a meeting via "Studio Look." The changelog states the AI leverages its machine-learning capabilities to get this done. In short, this means the AI will try to clarify your image and sharpen your appearance if things are fuzzy/blurry.</p><p>Google then reiterates a couple of Meet's existing features it discussed earlier this year, like "Studio Sound" and "Studio Lighting." The former enables the AI to "recreate and balance" your sound. Essentially, Google says this is Gemini working to fill in the gaps of your voice coming through your microphone if the frequency becomes distorted.</p><p>"Studio Lighting," on the other hand, leverages its machine learning to "simulate" a studio's lighting. There are a few device requirements to get this working, to which Google encourages users to check its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/14441737">full support document</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZoWNjLezhNGXMXWEqfkeCi" name="Google-Chat-hero" alt="Google Chat logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZoWNjLezhNGXMXWEqfkeCi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6016" height="3384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google brings awareness to another Meet feature called "generate background images." The company is essentially reiterating its existence as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/updates-for-generating-meeting-backgrounds-with-gemini.html">this already started rolling out</a> last week for Meet. Gemini gives users the following options: Professional office, bookshelf, stylish living room, cozy living room, tropical beach, fantasy castle, sci-fi spaceship.</p><p>Google Chat is picking up a Gemini update for Business and Enterprise editions called "translate for me." The company says the AI in Chat will automatically detect over 120 languages and translate them for users in their preferred choice. The update continues with a Gemini's addition in Google Drawing with "background image removal."</p><p>Both features for Chat and Drawing are available for users.</p><p>Regarding Meet, Google states the custom backgrounds, studio sound, and lighting will begin today (Mar. 11). However, Studio Look in Meet will begin next week on March 18. It's worth reiterating that these features are for Google's Workspace Business and Enterprise editions (Standard and Plus).</p><p>Google dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-calendar-gemini-ai-add-option-gmail-rollout">a Gemini update</a> for Gmail yesterday, which brought better integration between it and Calendar. Soon, users will notice an "add to calendar" button if Gemini detects important dates within an email. Clicking on it will have Gemini automatically create an event for that date (alongside its time) in your calendar. This seems to have been the culmination of what Google started last year via its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-15-pro-side-panel-rolling-out-now-for-google-workspace-labs-testers">Gemini 1.5 Pro Labs test</a> for users, which was the start of its AI-powered side panel feature in Workspace.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge sightings have increased lately, pointing to an impending launch somewhere closer to the second week of April — which isn't that far away.</p><p>A new leak reveals two models of the Galaxy S25 Edge that were listed on UL Demko and India's BIS Databases. These listings provide us not just alleged model numbers of the phone but also battery specifications — which have been rumored to be pretty small from the start.</p><p>Now, these listings so much as confirm the above. First spotted by The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetechoutlook.com/tech-whispers/samsungs-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-spotted-on-ul-demko-and-bis-databases-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-batteries-also-listed-on-the-bis-database/">TechOutlook</a>, the Galaxy S25 Edge is said to launch with a rated battery capacity of 3,786mAh, which may translate to the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-leaked-specs" target="_blank">3900mAh </a>capacity that previous leaks entailed.</p><p>The certifications showed up with model numbers <strong>EB-BS937ABY </strong>and <strong>EB-BS937ABE</strong><em> </em>on the UL Demko database, certified with certificate numbers <strong>DK-162562-UL</strong><em> </em>and<em> </em><strong>DK-162516-UL</strong>,<em> </em>as seen below.</p>

<p>This only indicates that you'd have to be plugged into a charger now and then if you choose to get the Galaxy S25 Edge. For comparison, the base Galaxy S25 model has 4000mAh battery capacity, and with Samsung trying to fit all of its latest AI features into the phone, the device could be heavily reliant on its core processing chip. It is rumored to come with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, like the rest of the Galaxy S25 series, and a pretty hefty 200MP primary camera.</p><p>The only reason behind this could be the fact that the Korean OEM could be chasing the slimness of the phone over the battery capacity and its inability to fit in a more powerful one. The device is tipped to weigh around 162g and measure 5.75mm thin, much like Techno's ultra-thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">Spark Slim</a>, which managed to fit in a massive 5200mAh battery — making it possible to get the best of both worlds.</p>

The show was jam-packed with action, and the big debut of Flat2VR Studios' huge library of upcoming games, but one theme shone through the big showcase: co-op games.</p><p>While some of the best Meta Quest games are single-player — Batman Arkham Shadow, Behemoth, and Metro Awakening are just a few from the past few months — my favorite VR games almost always involve playing with a friend.</p><p>Seven of the 22 announcements today focus on co-op gameplay, giving friends the opportunity to hang out and take challenges head-on while working together. Social experiences are the best part of VR, and that's what makes these upcoming Meta Quest games so dang exciting!</p>
<h2 id="forefront-2">Forefront</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F9Kd-KMmNi4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Population: One used to stand alone as the Meta Quest's only large-scale multiplayer shooter, but the field has widened in the past two years. Contractors Showdown and Ghosts of Tabor proved that the Quest was capable of big multiplayer experiences, and Forefront is here to bring a bit of Battlefield into VR.</p><p>Forefront is the latest title from Triangle Factory, the makers of Breachers and Hyper Dash, and it promises to deliver excellent squad-based combat with vehicles and semi-destructible environments.</p><p>Given how polished Breachers was at release and how effectively it translated some of the best Rainbow Six Siege mechanics to VR, I've got high hopes that this latest release will bring the heat to the Meta Quest when it debuts in early access sometime this summer.</p><p><strong>Check it out on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://forefrontvr.com/discord"><strong>Discord</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/forefront/28816918137899319"><strong>Meta Quest</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2981220/Forefront"><strong>Steam</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="reave-2">Reave</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nug3EVdMJUU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I've put a lot of hours into Dungeons of Eternity since its debut in mid-2023, and Reave looks to take the successful formula and combine it with the PvPvE concept of Ghosts of Tabor. Players will enter public dungeons as a party tasked with plundering treasure and clearing out the monsters along the way, but be aware that this dungeon is accessible by *anybody* playing the game.</p><p>That means there's a very real chance another party could ruin your day just as you round the final corner or collect a huge treasure, or a benevolent benefactor could very well bless you with riches untold. Humans are funny creatures, but can you trust them more than the nearest goblin or living skeleton? We'll have to find out sometime this year, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.gg/mZ3xSN4s9a"><strong>jump into the Discord now</strong></a> and get ready for the early access debut.</p>
<h2 id="zix-2">Zix</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sD0gIgiqBQA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Zix promises to be a co-op roguelike as you've never played before. From the surreal visuals to the "ever-morphing worlds," players should expect unique gameplay they can experience in awe with friends. In the game, you're tasked with being an Acolyte of Chaos, roaming three different worlds in search of chaotic energy that you can combine to create entirely new realms, mix and match enemies, and just get crazy with the reality around you.</p><p>Zix boasts what it calls a proprietary gesture-based combat and movement system that foregoes menus and button mashing with physical movement. Developer Hidden IO says you'll be "dashing, dodging, launching projectiles, and stringing together attacks" using nothing but the triggers, grips, and your imagination. Just as you think you've mastered the controls, you'll come face to face with massive bosses and challenges you didn't expect.</p><p><strong>Check it out on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/zix/8582035711867299/"><strong>Meta Quest</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/635700/ZIX/"><strong>Steam</strong></a><strong> and wishlist it for its Fall release!</strong></p>
<h2 id="exoshock-2">Exoshock</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TkTUhwryz4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Exoshock will be at GDC in just a week with full hands-on opportunities, but until then, we're getting a full taste of what to expect from this 1-4 player co-op PvE game inspired by Helldivers 2, Warhammer 40K, Halo, and FEAR. The game utilizes a vibrant sci-fi art style with procedurally generated environments, giving players a fresh experience every time they venture out with their squad.</p><p>Developer Polarity One says the environments are "hostile, oppressive, and alive" as the ships you board teeter on the brink of destruction from the monstrous invaders. Exoshock promises to be "more than just another shooter" as it aims to push the boundaries of existing cooperative VR concepts. You'll pick one of three roles with a dedicated focus, including Flanker, Suppressor, and Technician, each toting weapons the developer says feel visceral and powerful. We're expecting this one later this year.</p>
<h2 id="roboquest-vr-2">Roboquest VR</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v13eqq7HflI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The original Roboquest release was an extremely popular roguelike on Steam, garnering over 16,000 "overwhelmingly positive" reviews on Steam since its August 2020 release. Now, Flat2VR Studios is bringing the insanely fast-paced action to the Meta Quest this Fall, challenging players to hone their reaction times as they venture out alone or with a friend.</p><p>If you've played the original, you'll immediately be familiar with the vibrant, detailed visuals, liquid-smooth gameplay, and overwhelming hordes of enemies that pummel you throughout every level. Randomly generated environments keep things fresh every run, and the upgrades you find along the way will prepare you for the massive bosses that dot the landscape to provide fresh challenges.</p><p>Grab a big ol' Gatling gun and a friend for Roboquest VR's release this Fall and <strong>wishlist it </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151760/Roboquest_VR/"><strong>on Steam</strong></a><strong> now</strong>. We expect a Meta Quest store listing to go live before the release.</p>
<h2 id="titan-isles-2">Titan Isles</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6TV3AyIU74" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Windlands series was renowned for its free-flying, grappling hook-based platforming gameplay, and now those developers are taking their expertise of unique VR locomotion to a new co-op adventure.</p><p>Players will shoot, slingshot, glide, and guard against enemies as they make their way through exciting levels with friends, culminating in titan-sized boss battles to conquer at the end. It sounds incredibly exciting, and the studio's pedigree gets us even more pumped for its release sometime this year.</p>
<h2 id="breachers-updates-2">Breachers updates</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X6oKZIIOOfE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Breachers has been one of my all-time favorite multiplayer VR games since its release in Spring 2023, and the game's 2-year anniversary comes along with a brand-new gadget that's sure to trip even seasoned veterans up: the clone projector gadget. This new gadget projects an image of yourself anywhere you place it, acting as the perfect way to fool your enemies while you lie in wait in the shadows.</p><p>I play Breachers weekly with a group of friends, and the squad-based action never seems to get old. Triangle Factory delivered a seriously solid experience in April 2023 and has been building it up since then, delivering free new maps at regular intervals as well as season passes and skins for folks who love that sort of thing.</p><p>The new gadget is available now, so what are you waiting for? <strong>Pick up a copy of Breachers on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/breachers/5740397619319389/"><strong>Meta Quest</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/breachers/"><strong>PSVR 2</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1922010/Breachers/"><strong>Steam</strong></a><strong> today!</strong></p>

<p>Samsung was spotted rolling out a couple of refreshments for its primary Galaxy app launcher in One UI.</p><p>A Good Lock update was seen rolling out for Galaxy device owners via the Galaxy Store by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-rolls-out-new-good-lock-update-with-stability-fixes/">SammyGuru</a>. According to the publication, users should soon start noticing and downloading/installing Good Lock v3.0.10.4. The page <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.android.goodlock">has been updated</a> recently, stating it's rolling out as of today, March 11.</p><p>Users checking the store should begin seeing the patch today, which is pretty minimalistic in terms of what it offers.</p><p>Samsung's patch notes are brief, stating it is "improving app stabilization." The company doesn't explicitly explain which apps this is aimed at. Additionally, the changelog states the update is "modifying some phrases." As the publication theorizes, this could mean Samsung is making its app descriptors for functions/features a little more clear for the end user.</p>

<p>Ahead of One UI 7's reveal on the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung discussed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">a few key details</a> users should be aware of. The main highlight is the company has completely redesigned Good Lock for its next-generation of software. Primarily, this overhaul concerns the experience its foldable users will have on the Flip 6 and Fold 6. Samsung stated "The overall composition of the main app has been changed for UI convenience."</p><p>Samsung's standard slab phones will see improvements — which you can see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">on the Galaxy S25</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, that announcement saw the inclusion of Good Lock to global regions. The company notes that, for the first time via One UI 7, Good Lock can be used "in all countries" for the first time.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-home-up-complete-customize-demo">demo video</a> highlighted by users on Reddit showcased some of Good Lock's refreshes for the Home Up module. Through One UI 7, users will have complete control over <em>how </em>their device's apps look. The video shows the ability to rotate apps, folders, and widgets without worrying about grid restrictions. While the vast majority are left on the outside looking in, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">recently announced</a> One UI 7 is on deck for an official rollout in April.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Brook Eaton, the former Fossil VP who spearheaded their Wear OS watches across brands like Skagen, Michael Kors, and Fossil itself, is taking his experience and close relationship with Google to Facer. And I can't wait to see where this partnership leads.</p><p>Facer CEO Ariel Vardi, who worked with Eaton when they preloaded Facer on Fossil watches, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.facer.io/facer-appoints-brook-eaton-as-chief-product-officer-to-expand-oem-partnerships-and-lead-its-113e0a881f1c">described</a> some ambitious-sounding goals for Eaton to "lead Facer's next phase of growth," with his role focusing on the following:</p>
<ul><li>"Bringing Facer to even more smartwatches and exploring integrations with other connected devices."</li><li>"Elevating Facer's user experience, marketplace, and personalization features."</li><li>"Pushing the boundaries of smartwatch customization and how users interact with their devices."</li></ul>
<p>"Customization is a core part of the smartwatch experience, and there's still so much potential to explore," Eaton says. "My goal is to expand Facer's footprint across more devices and platforms while continuing to innovate."</p><p>I wrote last year about my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">frustration that Wear OS 5 blocks Facer</a> because Google shifted to battery-saving XML watch faces (good), banned old formats that allowed for more creativity (reasonable but disappointing), and required users to buy watch faces from the Play Store (baffling and unnecessary).</p><p>Facer announced at the time that it was "working hard with Google to bring the Facer service" to watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, but couldn't resolve things before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> launched. It's been months since then, and we're still waiting for better watch faces.</p><p>I don't know if Eaton can break through Google's gridlock before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> arrives. But we definitely need better watch face "customization" across brands, and we should watch closely to see where Facer goes next with Eaton's new direction.</p>
<h2 id="unfinished-business-2">Unfinished business</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PfnPJetMLp9uUYqbCjgpfK" name="fossil-gen-6-apps.jpeg" alt="Fossil Gen 6 app list" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfnPJetMLp9uUYqbCjgpfK.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Fossil Gen 6 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm sure long-time Wear OS fans might have mixed feelings about Fossil watches. They carried the brand for years when Samsung Tizen was all the rage, but at a time when Wear OS 2 wasn't all that good. Then Google left its old partner in the lurch to focus on a more profitable partnership with Samsung — leaving Fossil struggling to keep up with updates until it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-wear-os-exit-shows-platform-improvements-less-competitive">exited the business for good</a>.</p><p>I came into Wear OS after the transition, but I still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-smartwatches-have-a-fashion-problem-hybrids-are-the-answer">feel the absence of Fossil's more stylish designs</a> compared to the distinctly techy vibes of most Android watches. Considering the current Wear OS lineup — Google, Samsung, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Mobvoi — it's clear we're trending toward the ecosystem being dominated by mobile brands rather than watch brands, with Mobvoi as the one holdout.</p><p>With that context, I look at Fossil's Android watch tenure as holding out against a stacked deck. And since Eaton kept Fossil watches relevant for all those years while dealing with bigger brands like Google, I hope that experience will pay off at Facer.</p>
<h2 id="where-facer-can-go-next-2">Where Facer can go next</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cLU4cq5oNV9uMKHJTXJEqH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-facer-pokemon-2.jpeg" alt="A custom Facer watch face showing Mewtwo in a pod on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cLU4cq5oNV9uMKHJTXJEqH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Facer watch on the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Facer's press release talked about "deepening platform integrations across Apple Watch, Wear OS, Android AOSP, and RTOS," so Eaton's work won't focus solely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a>. Aside from Garmin, most RTOS fitness watches only have a handful of watch faces despite the recent push toward AMOLED displays. Facer support on more watches would certainly give them a breath of fresh air and creativity.</p><p>Still, I think that if Eaton could make Facer a closer partner with Google, in particular, that would be the ideal outcome.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> and Android's open system make it easier to allow for the best possible complications on Wear OS watch faces; that way, choosing a fun watch face doesn't necessarily preclude you from seeing relevant data, too.</p><p>The Play Store just isn't a great place to search through watch faces, so developers and artists don't have much incentive to <em>make</em> watch faces and Wear OS 5 users may not bother to look or spend money. Letting Facer handle curation and categorization — as it has for a decade — is a better system, and it should be easy to filter out and disable downloads for non-XML watch faces.</p><p>And I'm certainly curious how Eaton intends to "push the boundaries" of customization through Facer. Will this involve AI art, which would give users limitless options but potentially annoy the creators on Facer's platform? Perhaps watch faces that change based on your health and fitness progress?</p><p>Wherever things go next, I'm optimistic that Vardi and Eaton can take things in an exciting new direction for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> — if Google lets them.</p>

<ul><li>Tipster OnLeaks has come up with the CAD renders of the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL.</li><li>All three CAD-based renders are now out, revealing an identical design — including flat sides and color options.</li><li>The only big change appears to be the new camera addition on the base Pixel 10 handset.</li><li>All three phones are expected to be powered by the new Tensor G5 SoC.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While we await the Pixel 9a launch, we already get to see what Google's next flagship series could potentially look like. The Computer Aided Design (CAD) renders of the trio Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL have now surfaced, which indicates very minimal changes over the predecessor models.</p><p>The renders were shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10">Android Headlines</a> in conjunction with tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks">OnLeaks</a>. They not only reveal the design but also some of the expected dimensions are shared.</p><p>Per the publication, the Pixel 10 is sticking to the near-identical design of the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, meaning it will have the same 6.3-inch display and will measure 152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm.</p><p>The Pixel 10 renders also suggest that the device will feature flat matte-finished sides again with minimal curves towards the edges for a better grip. The power button followed by volume rockers is placed on the right pane of the handset. The shared renders also appear in a pink hue as seen on the previous iteration.</p>

<p>The one big change, however, is expected to be in the camera segment as the leak suggests we would see a triple camera setup on the Pixel 10, unlike the Pixel 9, which came with dual cameras.</p><p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro">latest Pixel 10 Pro renders</a> also indicate that it will also be identical to the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, including the dimensions. It is likely to measure 152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm, similar to the previous iteration. We will again likely be seeing the same 6.3-inch display. This appears to be good news for the cases used on the Pixel 9 series, as it would fit the successors as well.</p>

<p>The Pixel 10 Pro will also be retaining the triple camera system comprising a primary lens, ultra-wide-angle camera, and a periscope lens. Unlike the matte sides on the Pixel 10, the Pro model is expected to be coming in a glossy finish.</p><p>The case appears to be the same with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-xl">Pixel 10 Pro XL model</a> as well because the shared renders suggest the same design setup as the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The former will have a 6.8-inch display accompanied by 162.7 x 76.6 x 8.5mm dimensions — nearly identical to the previous iteration. The XL stands out to be the flagship model in the lot — thanks to the large display and a bigger battery is also expected.</p>

<p>While all three Pixel 10 series phones aren't changing much in design aesthetics, we expect some solid changes in the internals, which can include the new and presumably powerful Tensor G5 chip.</p><p>Like the predecessors, the launch of the trio is expected to be sooner — maybe a couple of months after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-2022-preview">Google IO event,</a> which is going to be held in May. While we wait, here's a look at what we'd wish to see with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 has jumped into Samsung’s One UI 7 beta program, and it’s already showing off some upgrades designed specifically for its foldable form. The update introduces a few tricks from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">top-tier foldables</a> like the Pixel Fold to make the experience more seamless.</p><p>One of the standout tweaks in the One UI 7 beta for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is a smoother app continuity feature. Sure, the phone already had a basic version that lets apps switch between the main and cover screens, but this update fine-tunes the whole process.</p><p>Previously, though, users had to manually set up which apps could switch between the main and cover screens. But with One UI 7, Samsung is making things easier by adding three new options for app continuity, giving users more control, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/jspring86az/status/1898631350695194890" target="_blank">Jeff Springer</a> on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/one-ui-7-adds-this-pixel-fold-feature-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-6/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1856px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:116.38%;"><img id="zzhKNByxNC9HmTeTptNLCg" name="One-UI-7-app-continuity" alt="app continuity feature in One UI 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzhKNByxNC9HmTeTptNLCg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1856" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeff Springer / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The One UI 7 beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">kicked off on March 6 for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6</a>, rolling out gradually in select regions like India, South Korea, the UK, and the US.</p><p>Once you install the One UI 7 beta, you’ll spot three fresh settings for app continuity, such as "Always," "Swipe to continue," and "Never." As the names suggest, "Always" keeps your app moving to the cover screen every time you close the phone, while "Never" stops it completely.</p><p>Meanwhile, the "Swipe to continue" option gives you control. It only moves the app to the cover screen if you swipe to confirm, similar to how it works on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and Pixel Fold. If you don’t swipe in time, the phone just locks.</p><p>As shown in Springer’s screenshots, this toggle is tucked away in the Display tab of Settings. Once you turn it on, you can swipe to move apps to the cover screen when you close the phone. The menu does mention that some apps might not work perfectly, but it doesn’t go into details.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-notable-upgrades-2">A few notable upgrades</h2>
<p>One UI 7 also tweaks how the Galaxy Z Fold 6’s taskbar works, fixing a major limitation from One UI 6. Previously, you had to choose between keeping the taskbar always visible or hiding it completely. Now, there’s more flexibility.</p><p>With One UI 7, the taskbar also stays visible on the home screen but automatically hides when you open an app. If you need it back, just swipe up from the bottom of the screen, and it pops right up.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The OnePlus 13T is shaping up to be a compact powerhouse, with leaks hinting at battery, pricing, and hardware details.</li><li>Expected to launch around May, it could be the most affordable phone rocking the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.</li><li>A 6.3-inch display and a 50MP dual-camera setup make it more "mid-sized" than truly compact.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors about the OnePlus 13T, the company's upcoming compact flagship, are making the rounds, and a new one has given us some juicy details, including battery specs and a clue on pricing.</p><p>A reliable tipster on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5140922661342256" target="_blank">Weibo</a> has claimed that the OnePlus 13T could drop around May (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-13T-Cheapest-Snapdragon-8-Elite-compact-phone-to-launch-soon-with-massive-battery-onboard.974225.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). This high-end phone might give the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best compact models</a> a run for their money by packing the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip at a price that undercuts other Android flagships in its class.</p><p>Previous leaks suggest the OnePlus 13T will pack a 6.3-inch display and a 50MP dual-camera setup. While it’s smaller than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>'s 6.82-inch screen, a 6.3-inch display is more "mid-sized" than truly "compact" by today’s standards.</p><p>Even with the OnePlus 13T’s expected budget-friendly pricing, some trade-offs are likely. It’s rumored to have a dual-camera setup instead of a more advanced multi-lens system. What that second lens does—whether it’s a telephoto or ultra-wide—is still a mystery, though.</p><p>The leak also mentions that the OnePlus 13T will stick with an optical fingerprint sensor, keeping it in line with older OnePlus flagships instead of jumping to the ultrasonic tech found in the OnePlus 13.</p><p>The rumored device is expected to pack the biggest battery in its class, with a rumored 6000mAh capacity, which is the same as the larger OnePlus 13.</p><p>Originally rumored as the OnePlus "Mini," the phone was leaked as the 13T last month. With OnePlus skipping "T" models since the 2022 OnePlus 10T, this launch could signal a comeback for the once-dormant lineup.</p><p>If you’re after something a bit smaller than the OnePlus 13, it might be worth holding out for the OnePlus 13T.</p>

Google usually has keynotes and multiple workshops spanning across this two-day event. We don't know what the exact schedule looks like as yet, but Google did say that the first day of I/O 2025 will begin "with keynotes, followed by breakout sessions, workshops, demos, networking opportunities, and more continuing on day two."</p><p>However, it didn't get into the weeds of what it will be announcing (obviously), but we Android fanatics have a good idea as to what we expect will come out of this year's event. Let's jump in.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-is-google-i-o-2025"><span>When is Google I/O 2025?</span></h2>
<p>Google I/O is all set to take place starting on May 20 this year with the first keynote beginning at 10 am PT. Google revealed this year's I/O date following its traditional puzzle format, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-used-the-gemini-api-and-ai-studio-to-make-the-i-o-2025-puzzle">was interestingly designed</a> using the Gemini API and AI Studio.</p><p>Taking place at Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountain View, California, and will also be livestreamed for the rest of the folks who can't make it to the event. Google will announce its newest products, innovations in AI, upgrades to Android, and more.</p>

<p>The tech giant indicated in the date reveal that registrations for the event <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/">are now open</a>. Developers who are interested in attending the event get to register for free, and this will keep them posted about all things I/O, including updated schedules closer to the event.</p><p>That said, developers don't have to register for the live event since it is open to all. However, to customize your experience at I/O and make the most of your time there, Google suggests that developers create their Google Developer Profiles.</p><p>For the rest of the folks who intend to tune into the event online, Google will livestream the event in tandem via its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/">official page</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Google">YouTube </a>channel. While it's too early for Google to put out a livestream link, we will update this article when it does.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA" name="Android-16-Pixel9PF" alt="The logo for Android 16 on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The next big OS upgrade for Pixel and Android devices could be a part of this year's I/O. We're talking about Android 16, which also goes by a fun internal codename, "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-codename-sooner-launch-speculation">Baklava</a>."  This one seems quite obvious, not just to us but also to you as a reader, considering the two beta versions of Android 16 currently out to people who'd want to take the OS for a spin on eligible Pixels.</p><p>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">we received confirmation at MWC</a> that Android 16 will be released much earlier—in June, considering the teams have reached something called the "Trunk Stable" stage, where all the developers contribute their efforts towards a single branch of code.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:633px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.40%;"><img id="Nu9tEJdJtjLThotgChRnuT" name="android-16-beta-1-app-adaptability-updates-example" alt="Google is bringing app adaptability updates to Android 16 Beta 1, which is designed to help larger displays showcase apps fully." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nu9tEJdJtjLThotgChRnuT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="633" height="357" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The company’s President of the Android ecosystem, Sameer Samat, said that the tech giant is on track for its June release, which is super close to when the I/O is happening this year (get where this is going?). And with Samat stating they're likely to highlight more features ahead of launch, I/O may see some fun Android 16 features show up.</p><p>We're specifically excited to see the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed"> Live Updates </a>feature that everyone with the Beta version is chatting about, along with a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16#section-other-new-features-in-android-16"> more stable version of audio sharing.</a></p>
<h2 id="pixel-9a-2">Pixel 9a?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XJrBJTbAnK5LULvLJybsBG" name="google-pixel-8a-official-lifestyle-obsidian-01.jpg" alt="A person holding an Obsidian Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XJrBJTbAnK5LULvLJybsBG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last year, Google threw us a curveball and launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> way ahead of schedule. We would love to see it happen this year as well, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a>. Rumors do point to a March launch; if not, it could show up at this year's I/O.</p><p>The most recent leaks indicate that the mid-ranger will be letting go of its pill-shaped camera bump for a sleeker look that embeds the lens into the back panel of the phone. The device could come with a primary 48MP lens and a 13MP ultrawide camera. It could also get AI features from the Pixel 9 series like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a> and Reimagine in Magic Editor.</p><p>Other leaks stated that the device will come out in four colorways, sporting 128GB and 256GB storage options. The Google Pixel 9a should use the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Google Tensor G4</a> processor as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>. This year's version will fall under the same $450-$500 price range. Showcasing a 5,100mAh battery, 23W wired and 7.5W wireless charging, an under-display fingerprint sensor, and Wi-Fi 6E. While these are some of its specs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a#section-google-pixel-9a-design-and-display">here's</a> everything we'd love to see with the Pixel 9a.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-2">Android XR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another exciting thing that Google has openly been hinting about is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/looks-like-google-is-serious-about-android-xr-after-all">Android XR.</a> And we're hoping to see a full reveal of its capabilities at I/O this year. For starters, XR essentially means eXtended Reality and is Google's latest software platform, made "in collaboration with Samsung."</p><p>This software will potentially bring apps to smart glasses, AR glasses, and mixed-reality headsets. Sameer Samat, president of the Google ecosystem, told Android Central that they "never stopped working on" XR despite these public failures and that the "Gemini era" means "the time is right for XR."</p><p>Last year, it sneakily showed off a prototype of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">Google's AR glasses </a>while showing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-project-astra-could-land-on-your-phones-this-month">Project Astra's </a>capabilities. Additionally, Samsung also showed off its mixed reality headset dubbed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-vs-meta-quest-3">Project Moohan</a>" at the MWC last week. Samsung's headset will technically be powered by Android XR. With the company being openly showcasing it, we have a hunch we'll see more of it during I/O 2025.</p>
<h2 id="wear-os-6-2">Wear OS 6</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng" name="google-pixel-watch-3-build-a-workout-on-watch.jpg" alt="Build workout on Pixel Watch 3 directly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We don't expect to see a Wear OS 6 launch; however, last year's event gave us a glimpse of what we could expect from Wear OS 5. Considering Google may follow suit, it could probably show off some of the next Wear OS's capabilities.</p><p>For now, what we do know is that Wear OS 6 will power the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, and eventually OnePlus Watch 4. The tech giant hasn't officially announced anything about this year, but according to our wearables lead, Michael Hicks, credible reports suggest that "Gemini will replace Assistant on Wear OS soon and that a major hardware upgrade could make this version more powerful than ever."</p><p>That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">here's what we wish</a> will come with Wear OS 6.</p>
<h2 id="plenty-of-ai-2">Plenty of AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SQGiFaENVPagDxFZeZo6T" name="shruti-google-io-badge.png" alt="Google I/O 2024 check-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SQGiFaENVPagDxFZeZo6T.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, we will also be counting the number of times Google says "AI" this year while hoping for it to show off more of Gemini's latest skills as it did at I/O 2024. Recent rumors indicate that Google Assistant will be fully replaced by Gemini and that "Hey Google" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/looks-like-a-new-wake-word-could-be-replacing-hey-google">could be a thing of the past.</a></p><p>We're keeping our fingers crossed and eyes peeled if and when Google will show off its upcoming flagship device, aka the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a>, at least a quick short tease. Rest assured, this year's I/O will be filled with the latest tech developments within the company.</p>

This is a pretty cliche term that can be applied to anything, but it's especially true for the OnePlus Watch 3, OnePlus's incredibly successful third attempt at making a full-fledged smartwatch solution.</p><p>Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> relaunched the brand's hopes of having a successful smartwatch by introducing the first dual-CPU, dual-OS smartwatch powered by Wear OS. It got several things right — most notably battery life — but failed to meet the rigorous fitness tracking expectations that Wear OS watches are known for.</p><p>I'm happy to report that OnePlus ironed things out with its unique smartwatch architecture, which not only <em>improved</em> battery life over last year's watch but also fixed all the issues I had with fitness and workout tracking accuracy. The display is better and more eye-friendly, the rotating crown actually <strong>does</strong> something this year, and the company is offering an additional year of security updates.</p><p>It's a generational leap, as our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">OnePlus Watch 2 vs OnePlus Watch 3</a> comparison proclaims, and it's well worth your hard-earned money, even if there are a few things missing.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="izJLqptcYjzuei8gewjjDV" name="oneplus-watch-3-with-box-powering-on" alt="The OnePlus Watch 3 with its box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/izJLqptcYjzuei8gewjjDV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 retails for $329.99 USD or $449.99 CAD and comes in two colorways: Obsidian Titanium (black with a black band) and Emerald Titanium (silver with green band). OnePlus only offers one size, and neither color option supports LTE connectivity. The watch was initially scheduled to ship at the end of February but was delayed until April <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-pushes-open-sale-of-watch-3-after-meda-error">due to a typographical error</a> on the watch.</p><p>OnePlus sells a handful of different band styles and colors, including a blue one that matches the Ocean Blue OnePlus 13. Any 22mm strap will work on either watch, though, so you don't have to stick to OnePlus's own selections if you don't want to.</p><p>The watch ships with a charging dock and a red cable in the box. You'll need a OnePlus charger to get the fastest charging speeds, and you can use the one that comes with any OnePlus phone.</p>

<p>If the OnePlus Watch 3 has any one overarching theme, it's improvement to the point of excellence. OnePlus has come a long way since the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-watch-review">OnePlus Watch</a> launch in 2021 and now offers best-in-class performance, battery life, health tracking accuracy, and hardware design.</p><p>Essentially, the only things "wrong" with the watch are things it's missing. Everything it does is great, and that's what makes this an easy-to-recommend watch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UZUgHQ8pCurp87tTecRjNC" name="oneplus-watch-3-battery-life-01" alt="Detailed battery life statistics on a OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UZUgHQ8pCurp87tTecRjNC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When choosing a smartwatch, you often have to choose two major features at the expense of a third. Do you want great battery life, excellent fitness tracking capabilities, or lots of apps to play with? Galaxy Watches and Pixel Watches almost all exclusively offer great fitness tracking and app support but, with the exception of the Galaxy Watch Ultra, have to be charged <em>every single day</em>.</p><p>Smartwatches from companies like Garmin or Coros offer great fitness tracking and super long battery life but lack the apps of a Wear OS watch. The OnePlus Watch 3 is able to cover <em>all three</em> of these pillars without issue, and it's seriously impressive.</p><p>With AOD on, sleep tracking every night, and one hour of tracked exercise every day, I regularly got a full 4 days of battery life from the OnePlus Watch 3. While that's similar to the OnePlus Watch 2, the Watch 3 is able to do all this without the heat rate sensor problems and occasional notification issues the Watch 2 suffered from.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC" name="oneplus-watch-3-battery-modes" alt="The two battery modes of the OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Out of the box, the watch comes with AOD disabled, which will add roughly another day to your battery life. If you don't care about sleep tracking but just want this as a workout tracker and a daytime notification hub, you'll get a full 6 days of use from a single charge. Typically, with this configuration — AOD off and no sleep tracking, just wearing it during the day and tracking a 1-hour exercise — you could stretch that to day 7.</p><p>When the battery <em>eventually</em> gets low, topping up takes no time at all. In typical OnePlus style, a 20-minute charge will add about 75% to the battery, and another 20 minutes will bring it to a full charge. Even if you only had a few minutes to top it up before walking out the door, you'll absolutely get a full day's worth of use without worry.</p><p>If you don't care about Wear OS apps at all and just want fitness tracking, notifications, and sleep tracking, the OnePlus Watch 3's battery save mode will make it last over two weeks on a single charge. While this mode makes it more like a Garmin watch, you have the flexibility to switch back to regular "Smart mode" to get your apps back at any time.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>This is the best digital crown on any smartwatch, no contest.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 addresses a number of design and display changes I've wanted to see on smartwatches for a while. It includes a rotating crown at the 2 o'clock position instead of at the awkward 3 o'clock position, making it better for working out if you prefer the crown facing your hand.</p><p>This digital crown is larger than the one on the Watch 2 and, again, actually works as a rotating crown to scroll through menus. It's got a lovely grippy texture on it which, combined with the size, makes it incredibly easy to use. It's also got Pixel Watch-like haptics when scrolling which further enhances its appeal. This is the best digital crown on any smartwatch, no contest.</p>

<p>OnePlus increased the screen size and reduced the bezels on the Watch 3 versus the last two, all while keeping the size of the watch the same size. The bezel looks much nicer to me now that it has a protective metal bezel around the face, plus the 10-minute tick marks add a bit of visual flare that I see as an improvement to the design over the Watch 2's all-glass front.</p>

<p>The watch also uses a vibrant, bright DC-dimmed OLED panel that's easy to see in the sun but also that won't cook your eyes in a dark room. That's all without sacrificing brightness or display quality. A win-win if I ever saw one. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-smartwatches-have-a-flicker-problem-the-oneplus-watch-3-fixed-it">Lots of other smartwatches use PWM dimming</a>, which isn't great for anyone sensitive to flicker, meaning OnePlus is taking the lead on Wear OS eye health.</p>

<p>Last year, I wore a OnePlus Watch 2 and a Pixel Watch 3 to a Spartan Race. The OnePlus Watch 2 did a decent job but it fell victim to a heart rate sensor problem that regularly happened to me most of the time I wore it. Essentially, the watch seemed to ignore any high heart rate data if your heart rate spiked too rapidly. Given the intensity of the workouts I usually put myself through, this watch simply wasn't a good match for me.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 fixes all of that and is not only right in line with data from the Pixel Watch 3 — which I've been wearing since its release because of its heart rate sensor accuracy — but it also does <strong>several</strong> things better than the Pixel Watch 3 from a fitness tracking standpoint.</p><p>First up is the health dashboard. OnePlus OHealth app (not a fan of this app name, but whatever) makes excellent use of screen space and presents eight different data points without scrolling: daily steps taken, calories burned, workout minutes, activity sessions, heart rate with averages and a graph, sleep time plus a graph, mind and body score, and SpO2 measurements.</p>

<p>The Fitbit app, which is used by the Pixel Watch 3, only shows 5 data points upfront, so OnePlus has a massive advantage in design because the most important average metrics are in full view the moment you open the app.</p><p>The downside is that it's not as customizable as Fitbit's view. What you see is what you get with the OnePlus OHealth app, for better or worse.</p><p>The same design principles apply to the rest of the OnePlus Watch 3 experience, as well. When you finish an outdoor run or walk, the OnePlus Watch 3 displays a nice little map complete with a fantastic breakdown of your fitness metrics, including easy-to-read graphs and additional data if you want.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.03%;"><img id="2kJbdr5aM5YfZJmit4EkSm" name="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-3-post-workout-data-on-watch" alt="Comparing workout data available on the OnePlus Watch 3 versus the Google Pixel Watch 3 after a workout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kJbdr5aM5YfZJmit4EkSm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1291" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel Watch 3 tells you "good job" and gives a handful of stats, but the way the information is presented is often far too succinct. Any additional information can only be found in the Fitbit app on your phone, and even then, lots of it is hidden behind a paywall.</p><p>I also love that all of my watch data from the OnePlus Watch 3 is kept on my phone and my watch. OnePlus uses standardized cloud data to analyze my workouts for some of its AI processing functions, but my actual workout data isn't being processed anywhere in the cloud. It's all done on the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5670px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.08%;"><img id="e29umMwSvRhPHbiDhQDdKY" name="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-3-sleep-data" alt="Comparing sleep data between the OnePlus Watch 3 and the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e29umMwSvRhPHbiDhQDdKY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5670" height="2613" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That is not only nicer for privacy reasons, but it also means there's no monthly subscription to pay for to get all your data. Samsung also does this, so OnePlus isn't alone, but it's a nice change coming from the Fitbit subscription-laden Pixel Watch.</p><p>OnePlus also includes some truly useful data in each workout summary that I don't see on my Pixel Watch or in Fitbit.</p><p>On the OnePlus OHealth app, the map generated after an outdoor walk or run is not only more visually rich than on the Pixel — it shows a proper satellite view by default — but it's animated similarly to a hiking map generated through AllTrails. On top of that, you can select from two of eight data points to display on this map, complete with different line designs, map and route styles, and different video lengths to generate for the animated map.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.01%;"><img id="XKbvcc6JVFsFr29DqqqRS8" name="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-3-post-workout-map-data" alt="Comparing map data generated from walks, runs, and cycling by a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKbvcc6JVFsFr29DqqqRS8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4320" height="2247" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seeing all this data on a map is truly useful for anyone training to get more physically fit as it can help directly identify problem points on a usual route, plus where and how you can specifically improve over time. It's genius, and it fits right in with a lot of other things going on with this watch.</p>

<p>None of this matters if the watch isn't accurate, and I'm happy to report that OnePlus has completely fixed this aspect of its latest smartwatch. I've completed dozens of workouts while wearing the OnePlus Watch 3 and the Pixel Watch 3 at the same time — one on each wrist — and I've been impressed with OnePlus' metrics.</p><p>This is a watch I'm confident wearing for any workout, and I can even wear it fairly loosely and still get great metrics thanks to redesigned LEDs and heart rate sensors.</p><p>While the capture metrics were largely identical, one thing kept me coming back to using the OnePlus Watch 3 for all my workouts: auto-pause. It's not a revolutionary feature, nor is it the only watch that does this, but OnePlus's auto-pause works so incredibly well that it felt like a game changer for me. It nearly-instantly auto-paused my walking and cycling workouts the moment I stopped, and it impressed me every time.</p>

<p>I wore the Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus Watch 3, and OnePlus Watch 2 on several different multi-mile walks, using a manual counting app to log my steps. As I had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">come to find out previously</a>, the OnePlus Watch 2 and 3 are far closer to my manual counts than the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>One example is posted above but, on average, the OnePlus Watch 2 and 3 were usually within 30 steps of accuracy while the Pixel Watch 3 was typically counted around 150 extra steps.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xepaVEm9ETy59vWZ5zpyFZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-watch-faces-02" alt="The OnePlus Watch 2 (left) and OnePlus Watch 3 (right) held in two hands, showing their default watch faces." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xepaVEm9ETy59vWZ5zpyFZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 has more positive qualities than negative ones, no doubt, but that doesn't mean it's a perfect device. OnePlus addressed almost every single critique of last year's watch with this release, but it's actually the <em>lack</em> of features that adorn the list of cons for this year's watch — not missteps.</p><p>The biggest issue I have with the OnePlus Watch 3 is the physical size of the thing. I'm someone who prefers the smaller Pixel Watch model and even chose it when Google introduced a larger size model with the Pixel Watch 3. I already don't like the feeling of something on my wrist all the time, so when I wear a watch, I want it to disappear as much as possible. The OnePlus Watch 3 definitely <em>does not</em> do that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-google-pixel-watch-3" alt="Wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3 on separate arms to compare them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's great to have such a large display on my wrist, I find this large of a smartwatch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">a hindrance to activities like sleep tracking</a>. Maybe a different kind of band would help, but as it is, there were plenty of nights where sleep tracking was less than accurate because I wore the watch too loosely, a direct correlation to its size relative to my wrist.</p><p>Based on the number of absolutely huge smartwatches out there — plus the advent of the "ultra" form factor from some brands — I'm clearly an anomaly here. Still, imagine people with thinner wrists might not enjoy a big honkin' watch adorning them. Next year, I'd love to see OnePlus offer a smaller size, even if that means I get worse battery life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RnWwDpbakzj92EtTZvXnN" name="oneplus-watch-3-band-01" alt="The side of the OnePlus Watch 3 while wearing it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RnWwDpbakzj92EtTZvXnN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some people would also love an LTE connection if they want to take their watch hiking or swimming and want to leave their phone behind. Unfortunately, that's just not an option here, as the OnePlus Watch 3 only supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity.</p><p>And on the topic of "one size fits all," the OHealth app could use a few more customization options. I love the default data presented on the dashboard, but there's no way to customize it at all. You can't select different metrics to show, and you can't move the existing sections around at all despite having a long-press animation that seems to infer that this is a function.</p><p>I'd also love to see OnePlus start to incorporate some more advanced health-tracking features. Outdoor walks, runs, cycling, and other activities can plot step cadence, pace, and some other really interesting statistics but Fitbit is able to calculate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">the cardio load</a> to help you better balance fitness growth while managing recovery effectively.</p><p>It's effectively the difference between wearing a smartwatch to meet surface-level goals like step tracking and using a smartwatch's ample data to scientifically improve your health and fitness journey.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 is roughly the same price as its biggest competition — $300-$330, depending on when and where you buy it — yet offers at least one <em>fewer</em> OS update than those watches. The Google Pixel Watch 3 will see the end of its support around the same time as the OnePlus Watch 3 despite launching more than 6 months before it. If you're keeping track, that means these watches will see security updates through the end of 2027.</p><p>Considering my history with smartwatches, I think this is ample support time for a $300 smartwatch. OnePlus promises quarterly updates for its watch, which means you should get four updates per year, including four security patches and (presumably) one OS update. Samsung offers two additional years of updates for its watches but hasn't historically been very good at keeping up with these updates. In short, if you're worried about having a secure smartwatch in three years, you're just going to have to upgrade.</p><p>Outside of that, no ECG in North America is more than just a bummer; it's a huge missed opportunity for OnePlus in the world's largest smartwatch market.</p><p>The FDA requires that OnePlus pass a series of (expensive) tests in order to get ECG approval, which is why OnePlus didn't include the feature here. Elsewhere in the world, you'll be able to access this feature without issue. The latest Pixel Watches and Galaxy Watches all support ECG, so this is a major setback for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-new-health-lab-is-a-big-step-for-its-wellness-technology">OnePlus' fitness initiatives</a>.</p>

<p>Competition in the Wear OS space has dwindled as Samsung and Google have strengthened their chokehold over the market. If multi-day battery life is a must, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is the only real Wear OS 5 alternative. Even then, you'll <em>only</em> get a maximum of three days out of the Watch Ultra on a single charge.</p><p>If detailed health metrics or AI insights are important to you, both Samsung and Google do a great job in this area, but Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> pulls ahead with Fitbit-powered insights. It also supports ECG in North America, unlike the OnePlus Watch 3. The downside is that you'll have to pay Google $80 per year (or $10 a month if you don't want to commit) for this kind of data. For what it's worth, I don't think most people will find this level of data useful, but the ECG could be life-saving.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 offers three years of security updates and 3 OS updates, meaning it'll get Wear OS 8 before Google ends support. Samsung's Galaxy Watch 7 family will get an additional year of updates beyond that, making it the best choice for anyone who wants to hold on to their watch for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a beautiful watch with a bright, eye-friendly OLED display.</li><li>You want a watch that'll last most of the week on a single charge without sacrificing fitness features or app support.</li><li>You use your watch for a variety of exercises and physical activities and need one that's capable of tracking all of them accurately.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need LTE connectivity</li><li>You live in North America and want a watch with ECG support.</li><li>You like small smartwatches</li></ul>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 is the new best Wear OS smartwatch for anyone who likes big watches. It's got the best battery life among any Wear OS watch, including a secondary mode that'll triple the already excellent battery life if you don't mind reduced app support. Fitness tracking works impeccably well, meeting and beating my previous favorite, the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>OnePlus's OHealth app has improved to the point where I prefer its UI and features over rival apps. Data is kept and processed locally, and moving the watch between phones works exactly as you'd expect, meaning all your precious data moves with you when you upgrade phones. It even has some interesting and unique features, like an animated map after outdoor exercises and a short-form video scrolling remote if you pair it with a OnePlus phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>OnePlus can further improve the experience by adding a few more customization features to the OHealth app and giving customers more size and configuration options, but outside of those few requests, this is as good as Wear OS 5 gets.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-42">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google quietly ditched the Play Store’s app-sharing feature in a recent update.</li><li>The feature was supposed to be removed in a December update, but it oddly stuck around until now.</li><li>It was a lifesaver for users with little to no internet, allowing local app transfers without eating up data.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has pushed a sneaky Play Store update and, in the process, axed a feature most people might have never used: app sharing. While not widely known, it was a handy gem for some users.</p><p>Back in 2021, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/play-store-app-sharing-just-got-easier-googles-airdrop-alternative">introduced the app-sharing feature</a> that tied into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-samsungs-quick-share-feature">Quick Share</a>, making it a breeze to shoot apps directly between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. But, according to the fine print in the December Play Store update, this handy tool is now on its way out after three years of quietly doing its job.</p><p>This removal first came to light in December, when it looked like the Play Store’s v44.1 update would be the one to pull the plug. But, weirdly enough, the feature kept chugging along even after the update dropped. Fast forward to now, and the latest Play Store build has finally sealed the deal, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/09/google-play-share-apps/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, the app-sharing feature was a lifesaver in spots with spotty or nonexistent internet. Instead of eating up what little bandwidth was available, users could grab apps directly from nearby devices through local connections.</p><p>Back in the day, you could find the app-sharing feature tucked away in the Play Store’s 'Manage apps & devices' section, marked by a little 'Nearby Share' icon.</p><p>Google’s reason for axing app-sharing is a mystery. If you never knew it existed, you’re not alone. Safe to say, most people won’t even notice it’s gone.</p>
<h2 id="its-removal-is-a-big-loss-for-some-2">Its removal is a big loss for some</h2>
<p>Even though not many people used it, the feature was super handy for folks in spots with spotty or no internet. It gave them a way to get apps without relying on shaky connections. Now that it’s gone, it’s a real blow for anyone who depended on those local transfers to stay connected.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are still ways to get the job done. Plenty of third-party apps out there let you share data over Bluetooth. Sure, it’s not baked into the Play Store anymore, but the core idea lives on if you know where to look.</p><p>On top of that, Google’s own Nearby Share app is still up and running, letting you swap apps, photos, and other files between Android devices without needing an internet connection. And if that’s not your thing, there’s always Files by Google, which does pretty much the same thing.</p>

There's a new design that makes it easier to hold and use, a bigger battery, the same great 1-inch main camera as last year but with a new 200MP tele lens that takes outstanding portraits alongside 4.3x zoom, and the latest available hardware. <br><br>Xiaomi debuted the device globally at Mobile World Congress, and the 15 Ultra is now making its way to India, where it is sold in a single 16GB/512GB model that costs ₹109,999 ($1,259). As always, Xiaomi India is incentivizing the launch by providing freebies — including the excellent photography kit that's bundled with all pre-orders. The phone is ₹10,000 costlier than the 14 Ultra in India, and that's understandable when you look at all the upgrades. <br><br>Even then, it is a considerable bargain when you consider the same phone is sold in the U.K. for £1,499 ($1,932), and other countries in the region for €1,499 ($1,627). Xiaomi has always been aggressive when it comes to India, and that's the case with the 15 Ultra as well, and if you're interested in the phone, India is the best country to pick it up. I'd argue that it's better to buy the 15 Ultra in India than China — even though it's more affordable in Xiaomi's home market — because the Indian model comes with the Play Store and all Google services out of the box.</p>

<p>Best of all, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra undercuts the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL in India. The Galaxy S25 Ultra costs ₹141,999 ($1,626) in the country for the 16GB/512GB edition, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> is ₹139,999 ($1,603) for the 512GB option. Although the 15 Ultra costs more than last year, it is still the best value (as it were) if you want a high-end phone in India, and there's also the fact that it has the absolute best camera package of any device today. <br><br>As I noted in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">Xiaomi 15 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> post, Xiaomi managed to deliver a better overall product than Samsung this year, and the icing on the cake is that the phone costs less in India. In every other region, the 15 Ultra is being sold at a premium over the S25 Ultra, so it's clear that Xiaomi is intent on gaining a foothold in the premium segment in India. <br><br>Xiaomi also debuted the regular Xiaomi 15 in India, and like last year, it does a good job going up against the likes of the OnePlus 13. Although Xiaomi does really well in the budget and now mid-range categories, it hasn't really made a dent in the high-end, and it will be aiming to change that with the 15 Ultra and Xiaomi 15.</p>

The update brings more or less the same changes that we’ve seen on Samsung’s phones, including an updated UI, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a>, and more. However, there’s one change in particular that caught my attention, and it feels like Samsung is taking the right steps toward improving the cover screen experience.</p><p>I’m talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">using apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>. This has always been a pain point for me with Samsung’s flip phones, as the company hides this function behind menus and severely limits the built-in functionality to allow just a handful of apps on the cover screen. That is unless you know how to download Good Lock and install the MultiStar module, which allows users to add a new panel with access to almost any app on their phone.</p>

<p>The problem is that not everyone who picks up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is going to know this, and I’ve had to explain this process to a few people I’ve run into with the phone, who are always surprised to learn that they can do so much more on their external display. I feel like it’s a missed opportunity on Samsung’s part because there’s so much more screen to take advantage of.</p><p>With the One UI 7 beta, Samsung takes a small but important step toward remedying this. In the Labs menu, where you can enable cover screen apps, I noticed a large “Get MultiStar” button that sends users directly to the module in the Galaxy Store. Above the button is a short description that reads: “Download and install MultiStar to allow more apps on the cover screen.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:345px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:231.88%;"><img id="2bT2c5caKEfKAJP6KqQcGQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-Get-MultiStar-button" alt="A settings menu with various toggles and a large blue "Get MultiStar" button at the bottom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2bT2c5caKEfKAJP6KqQcGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="345" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The button will essentially bypass the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock app</a> and take users straight to the source. After it is installed, users can go to the Cover screen menu, where they can enable the Launcher widget under MultiStar. Alternatively, users can hit that same "Get MultiStar" button from before, which will take them straight to the Launcher editor, where they can select the apps they want on their cover screen.</p><p>The overall experience of using apps on the cover screen hasn’t really changed much, which is a little disappointing, given how One UI 7 has revamped so much of the overall user experience. For example, there’s still no way to multitask, you’ll actually need the app present on the Launcher for it to open via a notification, and you’ll still need to open the phone for certain tasks. It’s still an inferior experience to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which lets you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">use apps on the cover screen</a> out of the box and without going through hoops to make it happen.</p><p>That said, something as simple as adding a button can go a long way toward making more people aware of what the Galaxy Z Flip 6 can do without even opening the phone. Short of completely revamping the entire cover screen experience, this is the kind of awareness I’ve been hoping to see from Samsung.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="45qixYcw9UkSSQ7FVBCmLV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-leaked-render-3" alt="Leaked image of a blue Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45qixYcw9UkSSQ7FVBCmLV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are rumors that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will feature a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-shows-up-in-another-leak-with-starkly-familiar-camera-design">more expansive cover screen</a>, which could measure at least 3.6 inches or be as big as the one on the Razr Plus 2024. This is also a good sign that Samsung could be working towards rethinking its cover screen strategy from being completely panel-focused to giving users more freedom with the smaller display.</p><p>As much as I love the Motorola Razr, I really hope that Samsung takes this small change even further with the next major update and fully embraces cover screen apps without the need for the MultiStar app. This could make the upcoming flip phone battle between Motorola and Samsung much more interesting when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a> and Galaxy Z Flip 7 launch later this year.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A subtle send button change has been spotted on Google Messages; it now darkens when you type, adding a bit of visual feedback.</li><li>Unread messages now stand out more, with bigger profile pictures making them easier to spot.</li><li>The heart reaction might soon be replaced with a thumbs-up when you double-tap on a message.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Messages just keeps rolling out new UI tweaks. After a busy stretch of updates, the company appears to be working on fresh changes.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-ui-changes-2-3533559/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has spotted a small but noticeable tweak in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>: the send button shifts to a darker shade once you start typing. It’s not a game-changer, but if you’re a regular user, you’ll probably pick up on it right away.</p><p>This under-the-radar tweak is meant to make typing feel a bit more responsive, especially for those who might struggle with visual cues. As for when it’ll hit everyone’s app is still up in the air.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.20%;"><img id="dq2Nn9qZumgBCg58L7tSs4" name="Google-Messages-send-button-dark" alt="Google Messages send button turning dark as you begin to type" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dq2Nn9qZumgBCg58L7tSs4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On top of that, there are a couple more tweaks in the mix. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1j7ouwf/why_are_some_profile_pictures_bigger/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> pointed out that profile pictures for unread messages are now bigger.</p><p>It looks like Google is trying to make unread chats stand out more than just slapping on bold text. This could be a handy visual cue if you’re skimming through a busy inbox.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1040px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.37%;"><img id="b33z83F3QeTsrAaMZKoSjF" name="Google-Messages-profile-pictures" alt="profile pictures are bigger for unread messages on Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b33z83F3QeTsrAaMZKoSjF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1040" height="503" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Affectionate_Mall_53 / Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, it looks like Google is tweaking the default double-tap gesture in Messages, as per a separate post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1j5vnmn/double_tap_now_thumbs_up_not_heart/?rdt=37455" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. Right now, it triggers a heart emoji, but word on the street is that the tech giant is swapping it out for a thumbs-up instead.</p><p>Prior to these, Google has been on a roll with tweaks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>. The company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-read-receipts-placement-redesign-spotted">fiddled with read receipts</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-search-ui-change-apk-teardown-3528033/" target="_blank">revamped the search bar</a>, and even spruced up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-animation-3530857/" target="_blank">how message bubbles look</a>. It also introduced a new animation for incoming texts.</p>

<p>The alert slider has been so popular that OnePlus's sister company, OPPO, has outfitted several phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review" target="_blank">Oppo Find X8 Pro,</a> with one.</p><p>Lau's post talked about how great the alert slider has been over the years, but that praise was suffused with the idea that the alert slider was somehow "old" feeling and needed to be replaced with a newer, better idea. Thus, the company has considered swapping out the three-way slider — which is the easiest way to switch between silent, vibrate, and ring modes on any phone to date — with a programmable button.</p><p>The programmable button concept has become popular with phone makers since Apple launched its Action Button on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> in 2023. The most recent Android spin on the concept can be found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a> series, where Nothing made it function as an AI key for advanced screenshots and voice notes.</p><p>While Lau's idea of adding an action button is great — it's always nice to have more customizable options on complicated modern phones — the simplicity of the alert slider is what makes it so perfect. Replacing the alert slider is simply the wrong thing to do.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>OnePlus says it's listening to feedback and wants to hear your opinion. Now's the time to voice it!</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The alert slider makes it easy to know what sound mode your OnePlus phone is on with a simple glance. It's just as easy to switch between modes without ever having to turn on your screen or unlock the phone, and, for me, that's very important. I like my phone to make noise when I receive a notification. I miss notifications too easily otherwise, but it's not always appropriate for them to make noise.</p><p>While every phone has a silent or vibrate-only mode, no other modern phone makes it as easy to switch between these modes as OnePlus. This is a feature I use every single day, all throughout the day, and it's one of the reasons I use a OnePlus phone as my main device.</p><p>The silver lining is that while the OnePlus 13 Mini might see a release soon, the OnePlus 14 isn't expected until Q4 2025. That means there's potentially still time for OnePlus to reverse course before it makes a grave error. If you care about the alert slider and want to see it stick around, head to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1734468772149854214?irclickid=VGL2ESXUZxyKR2fx4DXsTSE3Uks1lwwFr3x-U40">the post on the OnePlus Community</a> and put your two cents in.</p><p>OnePlus, please don't replace the alert slider. We love it, and so do your fans. An action button is fine, but not in place of something that's already great. OnePlus has long been a brand "about the community" and says it's listening to feedback. This is the time to test that claim and see if it's true.</p>

<hr>
<p>Monday blues just got way too real for X, as people have been unable to access the app since morning.</p><p>X seems to be down for several across the globe. Several users reported to Downdetector that the app went down at around 5 am on Monday (March 10).</p><p>Users across several countries weren't able to view posts on the app as well as the website,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.ca/status/twitter/"> according to Downdetector</a>. It seems like the outage was on and off, as several users reported that the platform was back to functioning as usual before facing an outage again in a couple of minutes.</p><p>When users tried accessing the platform, they were shown a screen that said, "Something went wrong. Try re-loading." Android Central's staff also faced similar issues, with Nick Sutrich, who was unaware of the outage at the time and thought it could've been his network connection. He said, "I didn't even get an error, it just never loads sometimes."</p><p>According to DownDetector, 58% of users in the U.S. and 56% of folks in Canada continue to experience an outage with the app. If you see the graph below, there have been several points of peaking and equally low dips, indicating that the company is working hard to trace the source of this issue and possibly working on a fix.</p>

<p>At its peak, there were about 42,000 reports of the service being inaccessible, stated Downdetector.</p><p>After several hours, CEO Elon Musk took to the platform<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1899149509407473825"> to confirm </a>that X is under a "massive cyberattack," that could have caused the outage.</p><p>"We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.  Tracing …," Musk's post stated.</p><p>On the other hand, it seems like the service is slowly returning to normal for a few users in Canada, who are now able to view and put out new posts on X.</p><p><em>This is a developing story...</em></p>

The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Nothing Phone 1</a> was one of the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a> to bring wireless charging to the sub-$500 segment. Following that release, the succeeding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> also supported 15W wireless charging.

<p>My expectations were super high with the new Nothing phones. Some might even say unreasonably high, but why shouldn't they be? Smartphones are extremely, outrageously, unapologetically fun these days. They can fold in halves and threes, survive rounds in the dishwasher, and even be transparent!</p><p>Nothing took a bold risk that paid off with its insanely cool see-through Android phones that come with LEDs baked into the back. It's this courage to try something unique, even if not entirely practical, that gave me hope to see Qi2 on an affordable, transparent Android phone.</p><p>Even if the Phone 3a and 3a Pro don't have Qi2, I'm still going to hold out hope for the Phone 3. Can you imagine how futuristic a magnetic transparent smartphone would look like? And don't even get me started on the accessories.</p><p>The brand does accessories really well, bringing that transparent, techy aesthetic to earbuds. More impressively, Nothing succeeded in creating a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">functional modular Android phone</a> where companies like Google previously failed. This shows promise.</p>

<p>According to an allegedly leaked email from the CEO of Nothing, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-leaked-memo">Phone 3 is rumored to launch</a> in the first quarter of this year. I'm shifting gears and turning my gaze towards the future. I can't wait to see what Carl Pei has in store for us.</p><p>A clear phone with lights encased in a glass back is unique enough — now picture a Qi2 coil incorporated into that blueprint. Nothing will probably do all that and still maintain the water and dust-proof integrity of the device. It's going to be an epic phone if it matches my imagination.</p><p>You can't have a see-through magnetic phone without companion accessories. I love anything MagSafe or Qi2, so my number one want from the brand is a transparent Qi2 power bank. Guess what? I'm not alone in my musings.</p>

<p>A user named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/4842-nothing-qi2-battery-pack-concept-battery-1/4">3DPrintedCat took to the Nothing Community forum</a> to share their mockup conceptual renders of what a Nothing Qi2 wireless power bank would look like. They decided to dub it the "Battery (1)," which is right on the money when it comes to Nothing's branding.</p><p>The product concept is sleek, minimal, and highly modern. The clean white ensemble and circular lights inside the Qi2 coil have me drooling. Flat metal sides look so flattering on power banks and battery packs. It's impressive how this fan-made "Battery (1)" concept is so in sync with Nothing's design language.</p>
<p>If Carl Pei does not deliver on such expectations, it's not just me who's going to be very let down. Clearly, many fans are also dying to see such an evolutionary product from Nothing.</p><p>The first quarter of 2025 is almost up, so if the rumors are true, we'll find out very soon whether the Nothing Phone 3 launch will meet our expectations or fail to deliver.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola's next foldable is expected some time this year and the newest rumor ignites hope for a very important upgrade.</p><p>The company's upcoming clamshell, the Motorola Razr 60 Ultra/Razr Plus 2025, was spotted passing through the 3C Certification database by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/835/820.htm">ITHome</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/03/motorola-razr-60-ultra-might-come-with-faster-wired-charging-support.html">Android Headlines</a>). The device was spotted with model number XT2551-3, which is pretty much in line with previous database appearances. However, this time, the next Razr Plus was listed with a notable upgrade to its wired charging.</p><p>According to the listing, the next Moto Razr Plus features a stronger 68W wired charger.</p><p>There is something to note here as the publication highlights the charger's "support" for 68W fast charging. The post throws caution to the wind about this, stating there's a possibility Motorola won't push the adapter to its maximum. It reiterates that the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> was also spotted with a similar spec; however, it didn't happen. Instead, as we've seen since its debut last spring, Motorola opted to continue 45W wired charging like the previous edition.</p><p>For now, it might be best to take this with a grain of salt and see what Motorola does officially later this year.</p>

<p>Murmurings about the Moto Razr 50 Ultra or Razr Plus 2025 were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-60-ultra-early-database-certification-spotted">heard in January</a> when the device supposedly appeared in the BIS database. It was rumored that the foldable could launch earlier this year, considering its certification appearance was in January. It's speculated the device could land three months later, potentially in April, so we'll have to see.</p><p>Meanwhile, a huge Razr Plus 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-major-motorola-razr-plus-2025-leak-just-revealed-its-sleek-new-look">rendering leak</a> purports a similar design vibe for the clamshell. Consumers may see a 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch OLED cover screen like its 2024 counterpart. A 4,000mAh battery is also rumored to arrive to keep users powered throughout the day.</p><p>The leaks continue to speculate on Motorola's SoC of choice. This is where things differ as one side claims the (leaked) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">Snapdragon 8s Elite</a> could power it while others claim the flagship 8 Elite will get the part. The 8s Elite is rumored to be a toned-down variant of the more premium chip with a 1+3+2+2 array like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. That one Prime core could clock in at 3.21GHz.</p><p>Motorola made a similar tier-down SoC move with the 2024 Razr Plus, so it's not entirely outlandish, but moving forward accordingly.</p>

<ul><li>Google is starting to rollout an update for Gmail that delivers better Gemini integration between it and the Calendar app.</li><li>Users should soon find an "add to calendar" button if the AI detects important dates and times within an email.</li><li>Adding it is easy, and users will have the choice to edit the AI's added event in case more details are required.</li><li>Google recently updated Calendar with its own dedicated Gemini side panel, which helps users see their week's schedule and add/create events.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out a QoL (quality of life) update for Gmail's Gemini integration that makes important information easier to handle.</p><p>The update was announced via a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/add-events-to-google-calendar-using-gemini-in-gmail.html">Workspace blog post</a> with Google highlighting Gemini's presence at the heart of this new feature. The post states that within an email, there will be an "Add to Calendar" button with Gemini's star beside it. This option will appear as the AI briefly searches a received email for dates before highlighting its availability to mark it, if it's of importance.</p><p>Clicking "add to" will produce Gmail's AI assistance side panel. This panel simulates a conversation with Gemini as it explains what it's done. As an example, the AI will state that it's created an event within your calendar for a "Field Visit" on a specific date and time. Gemini will show a link to your calendar with the event's title and date/time, as well as a pencil icon (edit icon).</p><p>Users should be able to make any changes or toss in any additions through this method.</p><p>Google notes a few things of importance: the feature is only available for Gmail on the web (for English users) and using the AI to add an event to Calendar "will not include guests." Also, Gemini's automatic add button won't appear for "already extracted events like flights, restaurants, etc."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1007px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.58%;"><img id="7LNs6kJZSZjhLP6KPcJe8R" name="google-gmail-gemini-add-to-calendar-rollout" alt="Google's Gemini update for Gmail brings an "add to calendar" button for automatic event adding." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LNs6kJZSZjhLP6KPcJe8R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1007" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The availability of this feature is restricted to Workspace Business and Enterprise users with the starter, standard, or plus plans. Gemini Education and Education Premium add-on users will see this, too, alongside Google One AI Premium holders. The post says the rollout will be completed by mid-April for users on rapid and scheduled release domains.</p><p>This update, incorporating a better relationship between Gmail and Calendar through Gemini arrives shortly after the latter gained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calendars-web-client-gains-a-gemini-in-workspace-side-panel">a dedicated AI side panel</a>. In a support document, Google highlights Gemini in Calendar can help users in a variety of ways, from checking your schedule to making new notes. After opening the panel, users can "Ask" Gemini to check the current week's schedule, to which it'll return its high moments.</p><p>Meanwhile, the "Create" command lets users tell Gemini to create or add a weekly run, a lunch date, or commute blocks.</p><p>Bringing a side panel with Gemini to the Calendar app on the web is part of Google's mission as stated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-15-pro-side-panel-rolling-out-now-for-google-workspace-labs-testers">during its initial Labs</a> test last year. Leveraging Gemini 1.5 Pro, the AI is tailored to assist users in apps like Gmail, Docs, Calendar, and more with tasks related to those specific destinations.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's smartphones are dealing with some annoying issues following its latest monthly security patch, per its users.</p><p>Bug reports appeared like wildfire on Google's Pixel subreddit over the weekend as users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j7v479/random_brightness_drop_playing_a_video/">voiced frustrating problems</a> after the March security update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/10/google-pixel-march-2025-update-display-brightness-bug/">9to5Google</a>). Users reported a "random brightness drop" issue after watching a video on their Pixel 8 Pro. According to the post, their 8 Pro's display would being flickering and they'd suffer an "abrupt brightness drop" roughly "every 10 seconds."</p><p>They add that this issue is occurring every time they watch anything concerning videos, think Netflix or Prime Video, as the post states. The user notes other reports on the subreddit involve devices ranging from the Pixel 7 series to the latest Pixel 9.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j77exv/multiple_bugs_after_march_feature_update/">user's report</a> breaks things down a little more, but begins by reiterating a similar "brightness fluctuation" during a Netflix session. However, the user highlights another issue, one that's plaguing their Pixel's audio. There's reportedly a strange issue appearing with the device's EQ is enabled. The user has noted odd audio shifts, i.e, songs are much louder than videos, making balance hard to come by.</p><p>For now, there's no fix on any of these issues, but one user clocked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j7v479/comment/mh01d3b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">a potential remedy</a>. If your Pixel display is bugging out, the post suggests dropping your screen's fresh rat to 60Hz, instead of leaving it at 120Hz.</p>

<p>Aside from display woes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-vibrates-too-hard-march-update-3532351/">Android Authority</a> noticed Pixel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j3nzrf/haptics_became_stronger_after_march_update/?rdt=64519">users reporting</a> problems with unusually strong device vibrations. These issues started appearing shortly after Google's March security update last week, so it seems this can be lumped into the ongoing problems, too.</p><p>The publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j3nzrf/comment/mgl3xbe/?share_id=EOf8fm23qkNd9-kuLwMwQ">cites a statement</a> from Google about the issue, which says, "The Pixel team is actively looking into reports from some Pixel users about changes to haptic intensity. To adjust your vibration settings, you can go to Settings > Sound & vibration > Vibration & haptics." Seems like another temporary fix to hold users over for the time being. It's expected that Google will rollout a secondary patch to solve these problems, but when that will happen is anyone's guess.</p><p>Google rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-march-2025-security-patch-rolls-out">March 2025 security update</a> last week shortly after its major feature drop for Pixels. Users may want to exercise caution, considering the recent wave of problems plaguing a host of devices. The patch includes bug fixes for the entire Pixel lineup, including its foldables and tablet, for networking communication, camera, and audio problems.</p><p>Of course, this update came second to Google's massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March feature drop</a> for Pixels. The company rolled out enhanced scam detection for phone calls and text messages and finally dropped Loss of Pulse detection on the Pixel Watch 3.</p>

<ul><li>Pete Lau says that the new button is going to be designed to offer an intuitive and customizable experience while keeping the original sound-switching capabilities.</li><li>OnePlus also notes that it will actively seek user input to shape the button's features.</li><li>It appears the company is drawing parallels with developments like Nothing’s Essential Key and Apple’s Action Button, and we can expect more AI capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus has announced that it is replacing the traditional Alert Slider, which has been on the company’s flagship phones since their inception, with an all-new button.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1734468772149854214">According to Pete Lau</a>, the new button is designed to be more personalized, which is also not just smart but also “incredibly intuitive” and “future-ready.” He also reassures users that they will still be able to switch sound profiles on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus handsets</a> without waking the phone, similar to what the existing Alert Slider does. The new button aims to keep the best parts of it and unlock new possibilities.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="CqxQB7dsjBDWJwwmwxd2kd" name="oneplus-replacing-alert-slide" alt="OnePlus bringing a new customizable button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CqxQB7dsjBDWJwwmwxd2kd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lau reiterates that Alert Slider has always been his favorite feature on the OnePlus phones, which is why it has been brought to Oppo devices. However, over time, it eventually became a “huge piece of hardware” with minimal functionality, i.e. to just switch sound profiles. Lau further notes that It wasn’t also reprogrammable due to its limitations.</p><p>And, it appears it was one of the reasons to remove it from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-10t-review">OnePlus 10T</a>, which, however, received a severe backlash — and was later brought back in succeeding phones, including the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The company's co-founder further shares that he wants to hear from consumers about the new button and what they'd like it to do— further enhancing their daily handset usage experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rLvRdMrhJdAAySkgoVRevX" name="oneplus-12-never-settle-oxygenos-15" alt="Some new lockscreen customization options in OxygenOS 15 on a OnePlus 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLvRdMrhJdAAySkgoVRevX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus acknowledges that it is indeed a big change for long-time enthusiasts and reassures that it is not just about replacing the Alert Slider but rather evolving it with new capabilities.</p><p>On the whole, OnePlus’ approach should likely be similar to what Nothing has recently done with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a series</a> that now has a new Essential Key button, which has some AI-powered capabilities to get things done.</p><p>Samsung has also tried earlier to incorporate a new dedicated Bixby, which was, however, discontinued later. Apple, on the other hand, had also introduced an Action Button on the iPhone 15 series, replacing the good old alert slider, which is presumably  considered an inspiration for the OnePlus in the first place.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's March update patch is out and it brings fixes to over 11 critical items.</li><li>The security patch will be rolled out to the Galaxy S23 and S24 series, along with the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and up.</li><li>Delivery time of these updates will vary based on the device model as well as the region, Samsung explains.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung announced that it's bringing a couple of bug fixes with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">March security patch update</a>. While security patches don't bring in features, they help the available features on the device work better.</p><p>The March update has started to roll out to devices as we speak, fixing over 51 items that needed attention. Of these, 11 items were critical fixes, while the rest were high-priority items. Samsung says that this is a maintenance release for major flagship models as part of the monthly Security Maintenance Release (SMR) process. This means it includes not just Samsung's bug fixes but also some of Google's patches as well.</p><p>So far, the devices already receiving the March security patch (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/10/samsung-march-2025-security-update-these-devices/">via 9to5Google</a>) include the Galaxy S23 series and later, the Galaxy Z Fold 4/Z Flip 4 and later, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-a55-march-2025-security-update/">Galaxy A55</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung mentions some of them on its updates page, like incorrect default permissions on the Galaxy Watch's gallery, which could allow local attackers to access data in the Galaxy Watch Gallery, improper access to Wifi on the Galaxy Watch—fixing an issue that allowed hackers to update MAC address of the watch.</p><p>Other than that, it fixes issues with sensitive communication in Settings and accessing Auracast broadcasting, among others. However, Samsung mentions that other items included in the update will not be disclosed publicly at this time.</p><p>The publication adds that Samsung first began rolling out this patch to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6 </a>and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on"> Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> last week and is going to continue rolling them out to the above-mentioned devices as well.</p>
<p>The company notes that devices eligible for the upcoming security patch need to have their devices with an up-to-date OS. And that delivery times of the said security patch will vary based on the phone's model as well as the region the user is in.</p><p>That said, Galaxy devices are getting more than just security updates this month as the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices"> company confirms</a> it is expanding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">One UI 7</a> beta programs to Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-sensibly-sized-samsung-galaxy-s23-might-free-me-from-awkward-phones-and-camera-spec-overkill">Galaxy S23 </a>series, and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review"> Galaxy Tab S10</a> series at various points this month.

That said, the Korean OEM is all geared up to launch the official, stable version of the software to all devices starting in April.</p>

<p>Ray-Ban and Meta have teamed up with Coperni for a stylish limited-edition version of their smart glasses, blending tech and high fashion.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/ray-ban-meta-coperni-limited-edition-debut/" target="_blank">At Paris Fashion Week</a>, Ray-Ban and Coperni showed off a fresh take on the Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta</a> x Coperni glasses stuck with the classic Wayfarer style but gave it a fresh look with a translucent black finish.</p><p>Part of Coperni’s Fall/Winter 2025 collection, these glasses mark Meta's first official fashion collaboration. While Meta has released a transparent limited-edition pair before for $429, this version stands out with unique tweaks and Coperni’s unmistakable design touch.</p><p>Inspired by last year’s translucent limited-edition models, the Coperni version rocks a similar transparent frame paired with grey mirrored lenses. The standout detail is a bold Coperni logo on the temple arm.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8432px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7HHtUrJcyWG4DLHTnmVUQB" name="Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni Limited Edition Glasses" alt="Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni Limited Edition Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HHtUrJcyWG4DLHTnmVUQB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8432" height="4743" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Under the hood, these glasses pack the same tech as Meta’s standard model, including 32GB of storage and a 12MP camera. It snaps photos at 3024 x 4032 pixels and shoots video at 1440 x 1920 pixels, running at 30 frames per second.</p><p>You’ll also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">have access to Meta AI</a>, which helps you learn about what’s in front of you, jot down notes, and translate languages. Plus, you can make calls and do even more. Meta AI can even scan QR codes right through the camera’s view.</p><p>Meta also added Shazam support, so you can now use your voice to search and play songs on Spotify and Amazon Music. The company also rolled out Meta AI’s upgraded memory features for even smarter assistance.</p>

<h2 id="an-ultra-limited-release-2">An ultra-limited release</h2>
<p>The Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni glasses may be hard to come by, with only 3,600 pairs up for grabs worldwide, and they’re priced higher than the standard model. If you’re thinking about snagging a pair, they’re already up for sale on Meta.com, Ray-Ban, and Coperni’s sites for $549.</p><p>The higher price tag makes sense given how limited these smart glasses are, so if you’re looking to grab a pair, you’ll want to act fast.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a watch with solar-recharging capabilities for optimal battery life; you want something that offers multi-band GPS without compromising battery; you want a watch with health tracking features like monitoring for heart rate, stress, sleep, or blood oxygen levels.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a particularly lightweight and small watch; you prefer a watch with peak display resolution; you're looking for a watch that leans more toward connectivity or app support than GPS or battery.</p><p>The Garmin Instinct Solar 2X is a great health, fitness, and GPS smartwatch, especially for its solar recharging abilities.  The 2X Solar is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch#section-best-battery">best battery life on a Garmin smartwatch</a>, and for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-and-fitness-trackers-gps">best GPS option</a> for fitness tracking and GPS watches overall.</p><p>With solar, you can still get up to 36 hours of battery life when using multi-band GPS. However, backpackers, trail-runners, hikers and others out and about during the day can essentially get unlimited battery life when using solar charging and smartwatch mode, a major reason why this device is so well-liked. Plus, it comes with a built-in LED light, making it even more useful for outdoor enthusiasts and campers.</p><p>It's worth noting that those who want a lightweight smartwatch may not like the Instinct 2X Solar, as it's admittedly pretty bulky. It's also not a great pick if you prefer a more app-heavy smartwatch, or if you don't really need features like multi-band GPS or solar charging.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-87">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Chrome OS 134 is adding a feature to help extend your Chromebook’s battery life.</li><li>You’ll be able to cap charging at 80% to reduce battery wear, similar to Android 15’s feature for Pixel phones.</li><li>Charging stays at 100% by default, so if you don’t want to limit it, no action is needed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Chrome OS 134 is rolling out a handy new feature that’ll help you take better care of your Chromebook’s battery and make it last longer.</p><p>Over on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/1j4f54l/chromeos_134_is_finally_adding_a_battery_charge/" target="_blank">ChromeOS subreddit</a>, people have spotted a new feature mentioned in the latest Chrome Enterprise and Education <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7679408" target="_blank">release notes</a>. It’s set to drop in version 134, which is expected to roll out later this month (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chromeos-134-battery-charge-limit-feature-3533345/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>According to the ChromeOS 133 release notes, a new optional battery charge limit feature is on the way in the next update. Similar to what Google recently rolled out for Pixel phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, this feature will let you set a max charge of 80% to help slow down battery wear and keep your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">Chromebook</a>’s battery healthier for longer.</p><p>Chrome OS 134 will let both users and admins set a battery charge limit. This feature should be especially useful for schools and businesses with large device fleets, helping extend battery life.</p><p>The default setting will stay at 100% charge, so if you’re not looking to limit your battery’s charging to extend its life, you don’t have to do a thing. The feature is there if you want it anyway.</p><p>Otherwise, if you decide to use the battery charge limit feature when ChromeOS 134 arrives, you’ll need to manually set a max charging cap. It’s similar to the default setup Google introduced in Android 15, so it’s a familiar option for those looking to keep their battery in top shape.</p><p>Overall, bringing this feature to ChromeOS after its debut in Android is a great move. For users looking to extend their Chromebook’s battery life, the new charge limit option will help slow down wear and keep devices running longer.</p><p>On top of battery improvements, future versions of ChromeOS will bring some upgrades to Chromebook Plus models, like AI-generated wallpapers and video call backgrounds. You’ll be able to pick from a bunch of templates and create high-res images in just a few clicks, making it super easy to personalize your device and make it truly yours.</p>

You get a bigger battery with fast charging, a brighter AMOLED panel this time, and a slightly altered design that's easier to hold and use. After a month and a half of use, I'm ready to call the Xiaomi 15 Ultra one of the best phones of 2025. </p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nRQs4RKPLsvkbRhrjzMY27" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nRQs4RKPLsvkbRhrjzMY27.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi made subtle changes to the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and the result is a device that's quite striking. While I'm using the white model, the two-tone variant of the device is styled to look like retro cameras, and it is definitely the one to get. The aesthetic combined with beveled sides and rounded edges make it great to hold and use, and even though it's heavy at 226g, I didn't notice that heft in regular use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fByetpotnP9YVpgPMZvQr6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra side view with power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fByetpotnP9YVpgPMZvQr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is built to last; Xiaomi is using a custom glass solution at the front, and the back is made out of a resilient material that weathers tumbles with ease. I didn't use a case with the phone, and after a month and a half of extensive use with travel to three countries, the 15 Ultra still looks pristine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HXmEwKsjEoZjtXKpcmdBiZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-top-down-view-back-1" alt="Top-down view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXmEwKsjEoZjtXKpcmdBiZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung chose to go with a similar design, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> has rounded edges, and that makes it a little easier to hold. Outside of that, it is still a giant slab of a phone, and while the design is familiar, it doesn't quite stand out anywhere as much as Xiaomi's device. That said, the use of a titanium mid-frame gives the device greater rigidity. <br><br>Both devices get IP68 ingress protection, and I didn't see any issues in this regard. They both use ultrasonic biometric sensors, and the one on the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is great to use — it's fast to authenticate and is ideally located.</p>

<p>Xiaomi once again went with a 6.73-inch AMOLED panel, but it has much better brightness this time around. While the phone doesn't get as bright as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, it is noticeably brighter than the S25 Ultra both indoors and outdoors, and that's what ultimately matters. Xiaomi once again did a fantastic job tuning the panel out of the box, and you get vibrant colors and excellent contrast with plenty of adjustability.</p>

<p>To Samsung's credit, the brand did a good job slotting in a bigger 6.9-inch panel into the S25 Ultra, and it also has good color vibrancy. The anti-reflective coating on the panel makes it well-suited to outdoor use, and although it doesn't get as bright as its rivals, there are no issues viewing the panel under harsh sunlight. <br><br>Both phones do a great job with media playback and gaming, and they have good built-in audio. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra wins out thanks to a better in-hand feel and brighter panel, but the S25 Ultra gets a lot right — even though it doesn't quite have the same great feel.</p>

<p>There isn't anything missing on the hardware side of things, with both devices powered by the same Qualcomm silicon. Of course, Samsung once again gets a higher-binned version going up to 4.47GHz — while the standard platform in the Xiaomi goes up to 4.32GHz — but there's no noticeable difference between the two in daily use. Both phones are among the fastest available today, and they run demanding games effortlessly.</p>
<p>One point of contention with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is that it tends to overheat during extended gaming sessions; it gets hotter than most other 2025 phones I used, but the side effect is that it doesn't have any issues with throttling. The Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn't have any issues in this regard, and it continues to be a standout choice.</p>

<p>The S25 Ultra base model comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but Xiaomi is selling the 16GB/512GB as the standard globally, and it uses the latest UFS 4.1 storage module instead of the UFS 4.0 that's on Samsung. Similarly, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra comes with a Bluetooth 6.0 radio, and it is the only device I used until now to have it. I didn't see any issues with connectivity or while making calls, and the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has a fantastic vibration motor. <br><br>Xiaomi has a clear advantage with battery life; the 15 Ultra has a 5410mAh battery outside China, and it easily lasts over a day. The S25 Ultra also lasts a day, but the 5000mAh battery doesn't quite last as long as Xiaomi's device. Then there's the charging situation, with Samsung once again limiting its phone to 45W. Xiaomi retained 90W charging on the 15 Ultra, and it takes less than half as long to charge the battery as the S25 Ultra while lasting longer.</p>

<p>There's no contest — the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has the better camera package overall. The software I'm testing still has a few issues with HDR blooming, and as such, images aren't consistent all the time. Even then, the caliber of shots produced by the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is leagues better than the S25 Ultra — Samsung really needs to overhaul its strategy in this area. <br><br>The 15 Ultra has a 1-inch main camera with a Sony LYT-900 imaging module, and this year, it's joined by a 200MP Samsung HP9 tele lens that goes up to 4.3x, and a secondary 50MP tele that shoots at 3x. A 50MP wide-angle lens rounds out the cameras at the back, and this is the strongest set of cameras until the Vivo X200 Ultra or Find X8 Ultra debut sometime later this year.</p>

<p>Samsung is using the same 200MP main camera as last year, and while the S25 Ultra gets a new 50MP wide lens, it doesn't quite manage to stand out anywhere as much as its Chinese rival. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra wins out when it comes to dynamic range, color vibrancy, and detail rendition. Portraits in particular are stunning on the 15 Ultra, and you just don't get the same kind of segmentation or quality out of the S25 Ultra, and that's a real limitation.</p>

<p>Both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and Samsung has the definite edge when it comes to software updates. The S25 Ultra will get seven Android updates, with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra limited to four. Samsung also does a much better job rolling out updates on time, and although the S24 Ultra is yet to make the switch to Android 15, there's a good bet that the device will get the stable build before the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — Xiaomi just doesn't roll out timely updates. <br><br>The software itself is unchanged on both phones, so if you've used a Xiaomi or Samsung device in the past, you'll be immediately familiar with what's on offer. Samsung's push into AI with Galaxy AI gives the S25 Ultra an extensive toolkit in this area, and whether it's image generation or editing, writing assistance, transcribing, or real-time translations, the device does a great job. I used the built-in audio transcribing utility on the Xiaomi 15 Ultra to good effect as well, but the phone doesn't have quite as many features as the S25 Ultra at least when it comes to the AI side of things. <br><br>Outside of that, there isn't much to talk about. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra has better fluidity than the S25 Ultra, and it doesn't have quite as many annoyances as earlier iterations of the software. Both skins need a visual overhaul, but they deliver extensive customizability.</p>

<p>Xiaomi didn't have to do too much to make the Xiaomi 15 Ultra stand out, and the addition of a new 200MP lens at the back alongside the usual design and hardware changes make the phone a real powerhouse. It has the best camera package of any 2025 device yet, and while there are some inconsistencies with HDR imagery, it takes fantastic photos and videos in just about any situation. <br><br>The design is better this time around, the battery lasts longer than last year, the AMOLED panel is brighter, and the UI is better. The phone runs hotter than its immediate rivals, but it doesn't have any shortcomings when it comes to gaming as such outside of the heat, and I didn't see any issues with connectivity. <br><br>Ultimately, the biggest issue with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is availability; Xiaomi still doesn't sell phones in the U.S., and that makes it annoying to get a hold of the device in region. But with the phone selling in India, the U.K., and key western markets, it is easier to buy than the Find X8 Pro and Vivo X200 Pro, and that's a big deal in and of itself. <br><br>Coming to Samsung, the Galaxy S25 Ultra just doesn't do enough to push the needle, and I'm not convinced that it's worth the cash. It is still a great phone in its own right, and if you're on an older Samsung device and want to make the switch, it is a viable choice. That said, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra does a better job in just about every area other than long-term update guarantee, and if you don't have any allegiance to Samsung, I highly recommend switching to Xiaomi — you'll love what this phone can do in daily use.</p>

<ul><li>Rolled out in January, the Android 13-based update was designed to stabilize the phone's battery.</li><li>It could reduce battery capacity and affect charging performance for some owners who were eligible for free battery replacements.</li><li>The ACCC, however, has issued a recall notice to warn users of the potential fire and burn risks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The six-year-old Pixel 4a phone got a surprise update early this year. While Google was quite hazy about the release of the update, indicating it is just a battery improvement update, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Product Safety Recall program depicts the actual reason (spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/10/pixel-4a-battery-recall/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=threads">9to5Google</a>)</p><p>It indicates that the rolled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/older-pixel-4a-to-get-an-all-new-battery-performance-update">January update</a> with the battery management feature was actually to “mitigate the risk of overheating.” The ACCC's shared notice dated March 7 indicates that some of the Pixel 4a devices sold from August 1, 2020, to September 30, 2022. It also mentions a hazard noting “an overheating battery could pose a risk of fire and/or burns to a user.”</p>
<p>For those unaware, the update to the Pixel 4a was precisely rolled out on January 8, and it was based on Android 13. The units globally have received the update, including Australia. It was to improve stability for Pixel 4a’s battery, and for some other Pixel 4a devices; however, it was believed to reduce the “available battery capacity” and impact “charging performance.”  Even so, those affected devices were eligible for appeasement which includes free battery replacement.</p><p>The ACCC here reiterates the same and further provides the following steps, which are more or less the same as those shared by Google during the January firmware update roll-out. Here's what to do in case you have the 4a:</p>
<ul><li>Check that your device has received this firmware update.</li><li>Consumers can submit a request to find out if their device is impacted <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/workflow/15642495?sjid=18010863605852425767-EU&visit_id=638760748417158479-7770477&p=pixel4a_battery_help&rd=1">here</a>.</li><li>This issue does not affect all Pixel 4a devices; if a consumer’s device is not impacted by the issue, the firmware update will have no impact on battery management, and the device will perform the same as before.</li><li>Consumers may be eligible for an appeasement from Google. You can check your appeasement eligibility <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/workflow/15642495?sjid=18010863605852425767-EU&visit_id=638760748417158479-7770477&p=pixel4a_battery_help&rd=1">here</a>.</li></ul>
<p>While we now know the true reason for the surprise update roll-out for the Pixel 4a, it is commendable of Google to support such older Pixel phones. Surprise updates aren’t new for the Pixel 4a as the search giant rolled out a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-4a-gets-a-surprise-update">unexpected update</a> in November 2023, which was also Android 13-based.</p>

<hr>
<p>Last Monday, Nothing introduced its brand-new phones,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch"> the Phone 3a and the Phone 3a Pro models.</a> They will be available for pre-orders starting this Tuesday (March 11) in certain regions. Meanwhile, the Phone 3a Pro already has a new update bringing camera improvements and more.</p><p>It appears Nothing is making sure the Phone 3a Pro’s first experience for users should be hassle-free and is already bringing an update before the device’s availability to the masses. Tipster Ishan Agarwal on X has shared the latest changelog of the Phone 3a Pro update, which seems to have rolled out over the weekend.</p>

<p>The camera enhancements, per the changelog, include new camera presets for quick access, which can be shared and imported. The ability to share these presets also means exchanging your favorite camera settings and filters with others or within the Nothing community.</p><p>Additionally, users can also expect support for importing cube files to use their custom filters. For the unaware, (dot)cube is a specific file format for volumetric data that includes a color grading preset.</p><p>Other than these additions, in terms of camera, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a Pro</a> owners can also experience better overall camera performance, clarity improvements in macro mode, and refinements for portrait for accurate bokeh.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a> is another interesting feature introduced with the Phone 3a series, which is accompanied by a new Essential Key on the phone placed on the right pane. It is AI-powered and, as the name suggests, does essential stuff on your phone, and the new firmware is also bringing improvements to it.</p><p>After the update, users can quickly press to save what’s on their screen and “add notes, long press to instantly record voice notes while saving.” Then there are new Essential Space widgets included with the update that let users view their content directly on their home and lock screens.</p>
<p>For a better user experience, Nothing is also revamping the home page and detail page. Moreover, there is also a new “Upcoming” section to manage essential tasks in a single place. Lastly, there are smart insights, which can now be displayed in users’ preferred system language.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some other improvements incorporated in the latest firmware, which according to the changelog:</p>
<ul><li>Added AI-powered face and scene classification to Nothing Gallery.</li><li>Fine-tuned interaction and user experience in Nothing Gallery.</li><li>Introduced a power-off password verification feature. Find it in settings by searching for ‘Power off verify.’</li><li>Addressed various bugs for a more stable experience.</li></ul>

<p>It is encouraging to see Nothing already rolling out updates right before the preorders, which began on March 11. The Phone 3a Pro starts at Rs 29,999 for the 128GB variant, and the 256GB model costs Rs 31,999 for the Indian market. In the U.S., however, the company is selling the Phone 3a series through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://in.nothing.tech/pages/phone-2a-plus?awc=48011_1741606918_dc34f9d89c1f3a897be81cf6795791fa&sv1=affiliate&sv_campaign_id=103504&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_source=Awin">Nothing Beta Program</a>.</p>

ET)</a> After several older Chromecast users faced issues with casting over the weekend, Google Nest Team has acknowledged the issue and has assured that it is working on a fix. Meanwhile, Chromecast 2nd gen and Chromecast Audio users are recommended not to factory reset their devices.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-102">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>An “Untrusted device” error prevents content streaming from mobile devices to second-gen Chromecast and Chromecast Audio models.</li><li>Affected users were unable to cast content from apps like YouTube, with no option to proceed beyond the error message.</li><li>It is likely a bug affecting second-gen Chromecast models, potentially requiring a server-side fix from Google.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Some Chromecast owners who wanted to watch something over a weekend might have faced issues with streaming content from their devices. Several complained about having an “Untrusted device” error for older-generation models.</p><p>In particular, the second-gen Chromecast and Chromecast Audio owners have been the ones who have faced the error when they tried to cast content from their handsets (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/09/chromecast-2nd-gen-audio/">9to5Google</a>). With the above error upping up more frequently, it gave users the impression that their devices couldn’t be verified and that outdated firmware could be the issue.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1j7caui/did_google_just_brick_the_2nd_gen_chromecast">Did Google just brick the 2nd gen Chromecast?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast">r/Chromecast</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The issue has been reported by several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/">users on Reddit</a> and had occurred while casting something from their mobile handset through streaming apps like YouTube, for instance. The “Untrusted device” error only gave users an option to close the window, without giving any option to go forward. However, other features like screensavers using Google Photos, art, and photography seem to have been working normally as before.</p><p>Interestingly, it appears to be a bug, and, going by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1j7c352/chromecast_is_untrusted/">user complaints</a> on Reddit, the affected users include only second-gen Chromecast and Chromecast audio users, while the first and third-gen users didn’t have any issues on Sunday (March 9).</p>
<p>Reddit users have also started assuming that Google might have bricked their older Chromecast with the new error message, pushing them to buy newer models. Some have already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1j7kqii/chromecast_alternatives/">started looking</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">alternatives to stream freely</a>. However, it seems like the search giant might be issuing a server-side fix soon for the said models.</p><p>The publication further notes that Google hasn’t mentioned ending support for reported 2015-released Chromecast devices and, while some think the new error could be an indication of dropping support as it did with the first-gen model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/first-gen-chromecast-discontinued">back in 2023</a>.</p><p>As mentioned, the outage of the said second-gen Chromecast models is likely a bug, which was uncalled for. And we hope that Google might be releasing a fix as early as possible.</p>

Even if they have already done so, the team would provide instructions to set their devices back up as early as possible.</p>

<p>Smartphone branding in 2025 consists of a bunch of different terms and letters — there's Pro, Plus, and everything in between — but what does it all mean? It might seem hard to compare the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and the Phone 2a Plus, since their names sound quite different. In reality, they're both the higher-tier offerings available in the Phone 3a series and the Phone 2a series, respectively.</p><p>That means the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Phone 2a Plus</a> are perfect for comparison, and you might be choosing between them. The naming tweak tells a bit of the story between these two mid-rangers. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro brings a more well-rounded set of upgrades this year, hence why it has the "Pro" branding. Meanwhile, the Phone 2a Plus was a more minor spec bump, which explains the lesser "Plus" branding.</p><p>But which one should you buy? Let's find out and break down how these two Nothing smartphones compare.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-pro-vs-phone-2a-plus-design-and-display-2">Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Phone 2a Plus: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="53rjwbksdqALeehHLDVugD" name="nothing-phone-3a-pro-camera-island-01" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone (3a) Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/53rjwbksdqALeehHLDVugD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While these two phones are similarly sized and feature the Glyph Interface, that's about where the similarities end. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro measures 163.52 x 77.5 x 8.39mm, while the Phone 2a Plus is slightly smaller at 161.7 x 76.3 x 8.6mm. On the other hand, you'll certainly feel the weight difference between the two devices. The Phone 3a Pro is 21 grams heavier than the Phone 2a Plus, with the latter weighing 190 grams.</p><p>The Phone 3a Pro has a striking appearance, with three rear cameras and a flash positioned asymmetrically. The camera bump is also a huge, massive circular extrusion from the back of the device. For perspective, the camera bump itself on the Phone 3a Pro is about the thickness of the thinnest iPod Nano. Meanwhile, the Phone 2a Plus has a more subdued look with a flat back and a smaller, dual-camera housing.</p><p>Both phones make a statement with their transparent, raw appearance. They also have LEDs on the back that form the Glyph Interface, and the lights are all rounded to match the curvature of the camera housing on the Phone 3a Pro. Meanwhile, on the Phone 2a Plus, two lights are curved and one is a straight line. These LEDs can be used for notifications, timers, and more.</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro has a slightly larger display measuring 6.77 inches — it's just a tad bit bigger than the 6.7-inch panel on the Phone 2a Plus. While both phones use OLED displays, the Phone 3a Pro has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-does-ltpo-mean-and-why-is-it-important-on-your-device">LTPO panel for smoother refresh rates</a>. Both screens top out at 120Hz, but the Phone 3a Pro's high brightness rating is the same as the Phone 2a Plus' peak brightness rating. It'll be better suited for use outdoors and in tough lighting situations.</p><p>In terms of durability, Nothing decided to go with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">Panda Glass on the Phone 3a Pro</a>. It's hardened glass, but may not resist scratches as well as Gorilla Glass. If you prefer the tried-and-tested option, the Phone 2a Plus has Gorilla Glass 5 on the front. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro has an IP64 rating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">against dust and water ingress</a>, whereas the Phone 2a Plus is less protected with an IP54 certification.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB" name="Essential-Space-Organized" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The performance of the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and Phone 2a Plus may be more similar than you might think, depending on what you value. The newer model features a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> processor, ditching the MediaTek chip in its predecessor. While this chip has been optimized for AI tasks and was recently updated, it's still a mid-tier chip. Our testing found that in graphical performance, the Phone 3a series could actually succumb to the Phone 2a series in benchmarks and real-world tests.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.77%;"><img id="9yrBEFUbpZbEiQpCsCoKbn" name="nothing-phone-2a-vs-nothing-phone-3a-minecraft-gaming-performance" alt="Comparing game performance in Minecraft between the Nothing Phone 3a/3a Pro and the Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9yrBEFUbpZbEiQpCsCoKbn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That means if you care about gaming, you may want to pick up the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor in the Phone 2a Plus. It's paired with 12GB of RAM for increased performance, and that could be very desirable in some situations. Meanwhile, the Phone 3a Pro is offered in multiple configurations with 8GB and 12GB RAM variants.</p><p>It's worth noting that despite the Phone 2a series' apparent advantages in graphics, neither of Android Central's testers noticed poor performance from the Phone 3a Pro in daily use.</p>

<p>Both phones feature a 5,000mAh battery and 50W wired charging, so they should last long and charge fast. In terms of connectivity, the Phone 3a Pro has the advantage with Bluetooth 5.4. Both handsets offer Wi-Fi 6 and 5G, but support for U.S. carriers is extremely limited. Neither support CDMA, meaning Verizon basically won't work at all on either device. As such, this device is much better suited for use in regions like Europe and India.</p><p>Software support is better on the Phone 3a Pro, with a promise of three OS upgrades and six total years of security patches. Meanwhile, the Phone 2a Plus only gets three OS upgrades and four total years of security patches. Both phones can run Nothing OS 3, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, today. However, only the Phone 3a Pro will have Nothing's latest and greatest AI features, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">including the Essential Space</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing really went all-out for the camera system on the Phone 3a Pro. It's the best available on a phone of this price point, by a mile. The main sensor is a 50MP, f/1.88 Samsung lens with a 1/1.56-inch sensor size, and that large camera will help you take great photos. The real impressive feat is the inclusion of a 50MP, f/2.55 Sony periscope telephoto lens. It offers 3x true optical zoom, but a massive 1/1.95-inch sensor size allows for sensor crop to provide 6x optical-quality zoom with sensor crop.</p><p>It makes for photos captured at distance having great detail, as you can see in the gallery below. These photos were taken at various zoom levels with the Nothing Phone 3a Pro:</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 2a Plus' camera system is no slouch, either. It has a 50MP, f/1.9 Samsung GN9 main sensor paired with a 50MP, f/2.2 Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens. Both of these cameras are excellent for the price, but neither can deliver the level of optical quality zoom that the Phone 3a Pro can. That's because the Phone 2a Plus only offers a dual-camera system, and it lacks a telephoto lens.</p><p>On the front, both phones are completely equal. They're both using a 50MP, f/2.2 Samsung lens with a 1/2.76-inch sensor size.</p>

<p>The choice between the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and the Phone 2a Plus is pretty cut-and-dry, as long as specs and value proposition are your main priorities. The Phone 3a Pro has the better processor overall, the better camera system, and full-fledged Nothing OS 3. It's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a>. However, it does have that chunky camera bump, so I can understand wanting to grab the Phone 2a Plus for a more subdued look.</p><p>The good news is that if you have the Phone 2a Plus, there's no need to upgrade. You already have the exact same battery capacity, charging speeds, and front-facing camera as the newer model. Additionally, the Phone 2a Plus is set to get two more Android OS upgrades, meaning it has plenty of life left in it.</p>

<ul><li>Pixel users are dealing with a screen brightness glitch after the March update, mostly when watching videos in fullscreen.</li><li>Some Pixel 9 Pro users also noticed wallpapers dimming while icons stay bright, hinting at a broader display bug.</li><li>A temporary fix is turning off Smooth Display, but that means losing the 120Hz refresh rate, making scrolling less smooth.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A growing number of Pixel users are speaking up about a screen brightness glitch hitting their phones after the March update, and it seems to kick in mostly when they’re watching videos in fullscreen.</p><p>Google’s March Pixel Feature Drop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">rolled out some handy upgrades and fixed a few key bugs</a>, but as usual with software updates, there’s always a chance for new quirks to pop up after the fact.</p><p>Reddit users are now flagging a screen brightness glitch presumably tied to the March Feature Drop, mostly messing with video playback (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-phone-brightness-bug-3533289/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). One Pixel 8 Pro owner <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j596zm/netflix_brightness_bug_after_a15_qpr2_update/" target="_blank">shared their experience</a>, mentioning constant, annoying shifts in brightness while streaming Netflix, with the screen cycling between too bright and too dim.</p><p>The user specifically blamed the March Feature Drop for the display glitch, noting it wasn’t an issue before the update. Many others backed this up, pointing to the update as the cause. And even with adaptive brightness turned off, the problem stuck around, so that feature’s definitely not the culprit.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> user also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j5khf5/brightness_issue/?rdt=46254" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the brightness issue, noticing the same flickering on Prime Video, not just Netflix. Other Pixel users have reported similar problems on Disney+ and YouTube, making it clear this isn’t just an app-specific bug.</p><p>Another user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j543po/wallpaper_very_dark_after_march_update/" target="_blank">noticed</a> that on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, wallpapers look dim even at max brightness, while icons stay as bright as expected. Several Pixel 8 users chimed in with the same issue, suggesting this might be a wider problem across multiple models.</p><p>It looks like the brightness glitch is popping up across a bunch of Pixel models, from the Pixel 6 series all the way to the Pixel 9. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j5llvm/netflix_brightness_flickering_issue_after_march/" target="_blank">Pixel 7 Pro user</a> even figured out a specific trigger on Netflix where the flickering only happens when subtitles are turned on.</p><p>One Pixel 9 user found a quick fix, though it comes with a trade-off. Turning off the Smooth Display setting stops the flickering, but it also locks the screen to a 60Hz refresh rate instead of the smoother 120Hz. That means scrolling and animations won’t feel as fluid, but at least the brightness issue is gone.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Google for comment and will update this story as soon as we hear back.</p>

<ul><li>The DOJ is still pushing Google to sell Chrome, and maybe even Android, to break its search monopoly.</li><li>Selling Chrome would give other search engines a real shot at a broader reach of users, as per the filing.</li><li>The DOJ dropped its demand for Google to sell AI investments but wants stricter oversight.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The US Department of Justice is once again <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">pressuring Google to divest Chrome</a>, with the goal of challenging its dominant position in search and promoting fair competition.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/attorneygeneral/documents/pr/2025/2025-3-google.pdf" target="_blank">revised filing</a> to Judge Amit Mehta, the DOJ is doubling down on its push for Google to sell off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a>, and maybe even Android. The agency argues that breaking up these key assets is the only way to fix Google’s monopoly problem.</p><p>A group of 38 state attorneys general and the DOJ have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral/news/2025/3/7/pr25-13.html" target="_blank">teamed up</a> to file the updated proposal laying out the final steps to break Google’s illegal stranglehold on the search engine market. It stays close to the original one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">submitted to Judge Amit Mehta last November</a>, following his historic ruling that Google is a monopoly in online search.</p><p>In its latest filing, the DOJ argues that forcing Google to sell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome</a> would break its grip on a key search gateway, opening the door for real competition. It also kept an earlier proposal to stop Google from cutting deals with companies like Apple, phone manufacturers, and Mozilla to lock in its search engine as the default.</p><p>A key change in the DOJ’s updated proposal is ditching the demand for Google to sell off its AI investments. Instead of an outright ban, the agency is moving toward a more watchful approach, requiring Google to give regulators a heads-up before making any moves in the AI space.</p><p>The DOJ is also holding off on forcing Google to sell Android for now. Instead, the court will keep the option on the table, ready to step in if the current fixes don’t level the playing field. If competition doesn’t improve, Google might have to let go of the operating system down the line.</p><p>Google is expected to counter the proposals with its own. In its December filing, the company slammed the DOJ’s initial demands as over the top, calling them an "interventionist agenda" that went way beyond the court’s ruling. Google argued the case was about its deals with partners, not the massive overhaul the DOJ is pushing for.</p>

Some were gimmicky, while others clearly put some thought into making things practical.</p><p>The Liberty 4 Pro is the latter, and not only do they sound good, but they also give you some valuable controls for your earbuds when you’re in Zoom meetings or just listening from the desktop and want to control your sound.</p><p>Here are my full thoughts on the Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro.</p>

<p>The Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro are available from soundcore.com and Amazon for $130. You can pick up a pair in Glossy Black, White, and Glossy Light Blue.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review" target="_blank">Liberty 4 NC </a>went on sale pretty regularly, and the Liberty 4 Pro did see a $30 price drop during the holiday season, so it’s reasonable to think you’d be able to get a better deal if you’re patient.</p>

<p>Let’s get right to it! The sound produced by the Liberty 4 Pros is powerful! You get a soundstage with headroom to spare, boomy bass, punchy mids, and output that has you rarely needing to raise the source volume higher than around 65% of max.</p><p>Though not the highest durability rating, the Liberty 4 Pro should be able to handle whatever workouts you throw at them with an IP55 rating for water and dust ingress. They ship with Bluetooth 5.3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC codec</a> support for hi-res wireless audio, along with Spatial Audio support. You get Easy Chat, which is an audio ducking feature that “hears” conversation and lowers the audio volume so you can carry on a conversation.</p><p>There are <em>a lot</em> of customization options on board here, including five additional earbud tips in the box, not including the medium ear tips that are installed by default. The remaining wealth of options can be found in the app. More on that in a moment.</p>

<p>The big marketing push with this latest iteration of the Liberty from Anker’s Soundcore brand is the case. It has some cool features that are expanded when you use the app. The default is that when you take the earbuds out of their case, you’ll automatically see the battery status, and then the screen transitions to controlling ANC.</p><p>This isn’t a touch screen likely because it’s so tiny that your finger would cover the majority of the screen real estate. Instead, you get a touch bar below the screen to control the ANC slider.</p><p>Going into the app and the <em>Charging Case Settings</em> menu, you can turn on spatial audio controls, atmospheric ANC status display, a Find Device feature that allows you to ring the case and earbuds independently if you can’t find them, and a remote camera shutter function if your phone supports it. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> did support it and worked flawlessly as long as the camera was launched first on the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KvajgqZxRXjauBsiTFhKnU" name="soundcore-liberty-4-pro-smart-screen-case-closed-alt.JPG" alt="Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro showing smart screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KvajgqZxRXjauBsiTFhKnU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My only gripe is that with the transparent lid shut, you can only control the default setting, ANC. When activated from the app, all other options can only be accessed with the lid in the open position.</p><p>I wonder how many people will use the case, though, because you can access ANC and spatial audio options from Android and iOS widgets. The Find Device functionality is likely the only case function that is worth pulling the case out for most people.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="632WdUrakesUG4JYG5rZYU" name="soundcore-liberty-4-pro-smart-screen-touch-pad" alt="Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro showing smart screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/632WdUrakesUG4JYG5rZYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro touch bar, with the case closed </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think that the case functions will be most useful as a desktop remote extension of the app like a smartwatch is, to a great degree, a useful extension of your phone. Unlike your phone, you don’t need to unlock the case to access the default features or those you add to it via the app. So, the case sitting on your desktop while you’re doing work is the ideal use case for the touch bar and smart display.</p>

<p>As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review">Liberty 4 NC</a> did, the Liberty Pro gives you a lot of features for a reasonable price. Battery life is just under six hours in my testing at 65% of max volume on my Google Pixel 9. The great thing is that you can get four hours of playback time with just five minutes inside the charging case.</p><p>The battery isn’t the only aspect that has juice! The power output is wonderful. On a Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, I rarely had to have the volume higher than 65%. A pet peeve of mine is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">Bluetooth earbuds</a> that require me to crank the volume to the maximum to get robust audio.</p><p>For a $130 pair of earbuds and in true Soundcore style, the Liberty 4 Pros punch above their weight. They’re definitely tuned for popular music, but their clarity and sub-bass extension are delightful.</p><p>Listening to Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’,” you get a very clear sonic picture of the beautifully layered instrumentation. The horns are crisp, the upright bass is thumping with a deep resonance, and the sparse vocals that are layered somewhat in the background are easily audible.</p><p>However, there’s more moanin’ to be had. Art Blakey’s version of “Moanin’” is where you get a sense of just how bright the Liberty 4 Pro can be as the horns on that composition become fatiguing after a bit. As entertaining as the sound profile is, it doesn’t sacrifice anything at the higher frequencies.</p><p>Listening to other tracks like the “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the “Get Out” soundtrack and “Violin Duel” from the “Chevalier” soundtrack show off the enormous soundstage of these mid-level Bluetooth earbuds.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="vf7ngyHmT25Z7fNSpiixhR" name="soundcore-liberty-4-pro-ambient-smart-screen-remote-camera.JPG" alt="Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro showing smart screen Remote Camera menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vf7ngyHmT25Z7fNSpiixhR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Liberty 4 Pro is indeed a solid performer, but nothing is perfect. As intriguing as the Smart Display and its functionality are, I’m not a huge fan of the fact that you’ll have to open the case for anything other than the ANC slider option. You can see through the case, so why have to open it for other functions?</p><p>Regarding sound quality, the 4 Pros can be a bit bright, so depending on the genre, your listening session may become a tad fatiguing. Thankfully, if that’s the case, there are EQ options to help tamp down that top end a bit.</p><p>And you'll definitely want to play with the different sound profiles a bit. Out of the box, the Liberty 4 Pro is definitely tuned for popular music, so the sonics are heavier on the low end and a tad lighter when it comes to nuance.</p><p>The previous generation Liberty 4 NC has better noise canceling, so if you’re asking if you should upgrade to these, I’d say “no.” ANC isn’t significantly better with the 4 NC, but it is enough of a difference, without a significant difference in sound quality, that an upgrade is far from necessary.</p><p>Last, depending on the fit of your ears, the earbud volume controls could be a bit of an annoyance. You use a sliding motion on the stems to increase or decrease volume. It works quite well, as do all of the other controls, but sliding at the stem could dislodge the earbuds a bit.</p>

<p>We saw some fantastic competitors emerge in 2024 in the mid-range noise-canceling earbuds market, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">you have some solid alternatives</a> here. First, I’d take a look at both Nothing earbuds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-a-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear (a)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear 2024</a>. The latter fully competes on features with the Liberty 4 Pro, though its case isn’t as “smart.” They do have better EQ settings with the ability to adjust frequency bandwidth, but it will cost you roughly $20 more.</p><p>You also have ‘buds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>, the JBL Live Pro 2 TWS, and a shrewd buy if you pick up one of Jabra’s “end of life” Elite 10 (gen 1) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-review">Elite 8 Active</a> earbuds. All are solid competitors to the Liberty 4 Pro, though if you prefer the stem style, you’ll want to skip Jabra’s products.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-soundcore-liberty-4-pro-should-you-buy-them"><span>Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro: Should you buy them?</span></h2>
<p><strong>You should buy Soundcore's Liberty 4 Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Super fast charging</li><li>You want Hi-Res Wireless Audio support</li><li>You want a case that supports some earbud controls</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy Soundcore's Liberty 4 Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Top-tier noise canceling is mission-critical</li><li>You aren’t a fan of stem-based touch controls</li></ul>
<p>The Liberty 4 Pro gives you a case that is larger than the previous generation Liberty 4 NC, but you’ll have to decide if its features are worth the increase in size. In every other metric, the experience you get is quite good for earbuds in the mid-range market, especially considering that you’ll save around $30 compared to some competitors.</p><p>For solid music reproduction, great call quality, and the ability to use the case as a desktop extension for controls, you should definitely take a look at Soundcore’s Liberty 4 Pro if you’re in the market for mid-range Bluetooth earbuds.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Strava may be the most popular fitness app in the world, with 135 million users and counting, 51 million logged activities per week, and 1 million communal clubs. But its new Athlete Intelligence shows Strava isn't resting on its laurels, and it wants you to know that its AI isn't "just an LLM," even if you might assume that.</p><p>On Wednesday, I watched cheerful Strava employees celebrate the opening of their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/stravas-new-global-headquarters-signals-growth-and-innovation">new San Francisco HQ</a> after a brief speech from San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie. He called Strava the "tip of the spear" to convince people that "San Francisco is open for business" and "the greatest city in the world."</p><p>Strava's multi-floor office focuses more on celebrating the <em>world</em> of fitness if anything. I toured the office with CEO Mike Martin and Chief of Staff Shelby Rhodes, who showed me meeting rooms named after internationally beloved segments like Central Park or Alpe d’Huez. I also saw a live Strava Photo Map that highlights photos that their AI labels as "beautiful" from around the world, as well as employees' bibs from their favorite races.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ywVuEqo8UTrwZfMzbdBzsi" name="Strava-sf-map" alt="A gif showing a full map of San Francisco, with lines representing each Strava user's live public route that day starting around 5am" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ywVuEqo8UTrwZfMzbdBzsi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But my favorite exhibit focused on SF: a live, chronological map of the city that showed the live flyover progress of local Strava users' activity that day. It's an incredible effect, and I told the Strava execs that they should seriously consider upgrading its weekly heat maps to let users see the previous day's activity, at least in the big cities. They don't have any plans for it, but hopefully, I planted the seed for it to happen.</p><p>Add in the library of running books and wall art showing people's GPS-made art, and it was nerd heaven for a runner like me. But as much as I enjoyed the tour, my main objective was to sit down with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-ushers-in-its-next-era-with-appointments-of-new-chief-product-officer" target="_blank">CPO Matt Salazar and CTO Rob Terrell</a> to dive into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Athlete Intelligence</a> — and figure out where Strava is going next.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, they couldn't say too much that's new about their "future roadmap," but I still got a sense of where Strava Athlete Intelligence could go next.</p>
<h2 id="athlete-intelligence-has-room-to-grow-2">Athlete Intelligence has room to grow</h2>
<p>Athlete Intelligence just left beta, and Strava claims "80+% of users say that Athlete Intelligence is very helpful" based on in-app feedback. I myself have noticed a definite improvement in the accuracy of the data, but I asked Salazar and Terrell what their vision of Athlete Intelligence is and how it benefits users.</p><p>Terrell explained that "it was important to me that Strava do something that was much more significant" than the "low-effort" LLMs out there that spit out vague answers and can only give generalized advice from Google.</p><p>Even if "from the outside, it looks like it's just an LLM," their goal was to "really synthesize the granular data that we have about the users' activity and do deeper analysis with machine learning to understand the context of that data."</p><p>Salazar, in turn, noted that "not all people are at the same experience level to interpret heart rate zones or their pace." Their AI makes this data "much simpler and easier to understand" for beginners who might not understand the impact of anaerobic activity or who don't want to check back at old activities to see how their pace has changed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8" name="strava-athlete-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Screenshots showing Strava's Athlete Intelligence: Left - an LLM summary of the athlete's half-marathon run and comparative effort to past runs; center: an LLM summary of how their pace compares to past runs above pace stats; right: an LLM summary of the runner's most common HR zone and the intensity of the workout above a HR chart." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Strava's AI primarily focuses on runs, hikes, walks, and cycling. I asked about their plans to expand to other activities, and Salazar explained that even as they "make sure it covers everything," eventually, they want to ensure first that "when we put out something, it's a sufficient quality," and that other sports might need more internal testing before it's "fully baked."</p><p>I then noted that Athlete Intelligence is very responsive rather than proactive: It tells you how you did after the fact but doesn't necessarily recommend a training plan or target pace for <em>future</em> runs as you get on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>. Will that change?</p><p>Salazar said that they're not specifically looking for "the next AI thing we can do," but rather "how do we help users achieve their goals?" Up until now, that's been through incentives like challenge badges, monthly goal targets, and kudos from friends. But AI is one "particular tool that we're looking at" that could come into play next.</p><p>Terrell agreed that Strava "historically has been a backward-looking product" that largely leaves planning in users' hands and that while they're "not announcing any products" on this front at this time, they are "interested in...being forward-looking."</p><p>Even without any specifics, a more proactive form of Athlete Intelligence would make it more useful for beginners <em>and</em> serious athletes, so consider me hopeful that this evolution comes next.</p>

<p>The most passionate response I got from Terrell, Salazar, and even the CEO was when I jokingly mentioned the time I didn't get credit for a half-marathon PR because my watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/sf-half-marathon-distance-controversy-shows-need-for-accurate-gps-watch">didn't measure the full 13.1 miles</a>. Apparently, a lot of users want Strava to "fix" this and aren't at all amused about it.</p><p>I frequently test the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-and-fitness-trackers-gps">GPS accuracy of smartwatches</a> and know how fallible they can be. But plenty of Strava users don't realize that — as Terrell put it — the app is "limited by the accuracy of devices that users are using" and that they want to be "as accurate as possible" rather than "fudge" the data.</p><p>Strava itself said in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-dethroned-garmin-on-strava-in-2024-heres-why">Year in Review 2024</a> that 72% of Strava activities come from users' phones, which aren't necessarily as optimized as smartwatches when it comes to GPS accuracy.</p><p>Users can trim activities if they forget to pause before driving home, but letting users <em>add</em> distance to a run is a slippery slope. Yes, sometimes GPS inaccuracies give you the wrong data, but sometimes, it's the course itself that's short. Strava's team wants to be "truth tellers...when folks are trying to compare themselves against each other, especially at a pro level," Salazar explained.</p><p>"When we first joined, Matt and I were like, 'Let's just fix it. This is easy!' And then we dug into it, and it's like, oh yeah, there's nothing—," Terrell said, with Salazar jumping in with, "there's a lot of steps, yeah."</p><p>"We understand the user pain here, and we're looking for ways to solve it, but there's not an easy answer," Terrell concluded.</p>

<p>I also asked if Strava would ever consider using its segment leaderboards to create official race leaderboards on Strava. They themselves said that more than half of runners at major marathons like NYC, Boston, and London logged their races on Strava last year, so what if runners could see how they ranked among Strava users and compare their race times against previous years?</p><p>Salazar answered very carefully that they "can't speak towards future roadmap, but...all I can say is that that use case is very important for us, and it's very much present in our minds. So I'm thinking about how we can help users celebrate that moment; we know it's a moment they want to celebrate."</p><p>While this isn't exactly a confirmation, it does make me optimistic that Strava might be working on race leaderboards that make it easier to connect with fellow racers you met. Labeling races and grouping times might make it easier for Athlete Intelligence to rate your effort compared to others in your age group and gender, which would be enlightening!</p>

<p>Just in 2024, Strava added Athlete Intelligence, weekly and night heatmaps, a dark mode, and closer integrations with Oura and Apple Fitness Plus. So far this year, they've improved leaderboard integrity, made it easier to share your workout flyovers to brag on social media, and just this week added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-introduces-proprietary-map-rendering-engine">3D FATMAP terrain data</a> designed for winter sports athletes to see gradients, aspects, and even the nearby danger areas for avalanches.</p><p>Strava didn't have any other future info to share yet, aside from telling me about FATMAP the day before its reveal. But I did get Strava's execs to hint at "future stuff that we shouldn't talk about," in their words.</p><p>When I asked if Athlete Intelligence — which currently seems to focus on your last 30 days of activities for relative effort — would ever look at older data or take into account goals like "training for a marathon," Terrell circled back to his initial point:</p><p>"We're not just stuffing a prompt into an LLM; we are building custom models that will allow us to do different levels of interesting analysis. And what we can feed into the LLM will be much more specific to the users, sort of their lifelong fitness journey. So the LLM is going to be able to speak to a much broader array of aspects of your active life."</p><p>Salazar jumped in to agree that they're always asking "how can we develop more sophistication in what insights we can give the users," and that Athlete Intelligence "is not <em>done</em> by any means." They'll continue to grow and smarten up the feature, making it more useful for a wider range of athletes.</p><p>It'll be fascinating to see how Strava's AI efforts compare against a hypothetical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">Gemini Coach in Fitbit</a> or the Samsung Health Coach coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6#section-one-ui-7-watch">Wear OS 6</a>. At the moment, Strava has a head start on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> and doesn't intend to slow down.</p>

However, that cushion might be starting to wear thin, leaving us to wonder whether the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is still the best that money can buy.</p><p>Samsung made a couple of surprising decisions with its flagship tablet lineup, of which only one really affects the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>. Dropping Qualcomm in favor of MediaTek was a bold choice, but besides that, it might look like there's not really much of a difference when compared to its predecessor. So let's dive in and see whether that's the case or if there's some kind of hidden magic.</p>

<p>No matter what your feelings are when it comes to using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a>, sometimes it's best when a company recognizes that it doesn't need to make any drastic design changes. That's exactly what Samsung has done with the Tab S10 Ultra, as it seems like we just have updated internals packed inside of the same shell from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a>.</p><p>That means if you're upgrading from the previous version, you won't have to shell out a bunch of extra cash for new cases or accessories. This was something that drove me absolutely mad when Samsung went from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/day-in-the-life-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra">Tab S8 Ultra</a> to the Tab S9 Ultra. Thankfully, it's not an issue this time around.</p><p>Externally, literally, everything remains the same, with the exception of the colors on the Tab S10 Ultra. The 14.6-inch AMOLED display is as beautiful as ever, making it perfect for getting work done, playing games, or propping it up to watch a movie.</p><p>Oh yeah, and the S Pen is still included in the box, which was to be expected but is still welcome.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="avuQxMo2wSET4Cxtb7a3i4" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-16" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected wirelessly to Samsung monitor via Samsung DeX" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/avuQxMo2wSET4Cxtb7a3i4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part is that the possibilities of what you can do with the Tab S10 Ultra are practically endless. I've used it as an external monitor for both my desktop and gaming handheld, a smart home dashboard, a digital notebook, and more. In fact, I'm writing this on the Tab S10 Ultra using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>, which is connected wirelessly to my 49-inch Samsung OLED ultrawide monitor.</p><p>It's a bit odd, sure, especially because the giant 14.6-inch display is currently doubling as a massive touchpad. That's because this kind of just happened on a whim, and the Ultra is connected to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-cases">Book Cover Keyboard Slim</a> (the one without a built-in trackpad.) Of course, connecting a mouse would make more sense, but I kind of like how I can just reach up and have the world's biggest touchpad.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cSw57RppXdGwwcfLjQggi4" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-18" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra acting as a monitor for desktop Windows PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cSw57RppXdGwwcfLjQggi4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To quickly recap, the Tab S10 Ultra is basically the Tab S9 Ultra that gets one extra year of updates. Well, not <em>exactly</em>. In a move that still surprises me, Samsung went with the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus instead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> or even the 8 Gen 3.</p><p>But to be quite honest, except for one very specific niche, you wouldn't know it. And that's a good thing because if that weren't the case, Samsung would have much bigger problems on its hands.</p><p>So why would Samsung move away from Qualcomm in favor of MediaTek? That's right, you guessed it — AI. The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra are being touted as the company's "first tablets purpose-built for AI." But before getting too ahead of ourselves here, let's see how the Dimensity 9300 Plus compares to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Tab S9 Ultra:</p>

<p>While single-core scores match up with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">Dimensity 9300 Plus</a> destroys its competitor in multi-core Geekbench AI. Which just so happened to be the two key areas of focus when Samsung introduced the Tab S10 Ultra.</p><p>However, I would go so far as to say that you wouldn't notice a difference if you were asked to use either of these in some sort of "blind test." On the one hand, that's great, as it would be a very different story if Samsung's flagship tablet ended up performing worse. On the other, you might've hoped to see more of a jump in the single-core performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hWQGjqFurzPqcXGCvJiiXR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-11" alt="microSD card hanging out of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWQGjqFurzPqcXGCvJiiXR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Especially if you happen to see what the Snapdragon 8 Elite can do in the Galaxy S25 with its 3,025 single-core score and 9,640 multi-core score. Mind you, that's for a phone that costs $400 less than the base model Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. Furthermore, the 8 Elite launched after the Tab S10, so it makes sense we didn't see it here.</p><p>Nevertheless, there's almost nothing to really complain about when it comes to performance. You'll still enjoy Samsung's suite of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, paired quite nicely with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>. So, I can only hope that Samsung has left enough overhead for any other potential AI features that we'll see in the years to come.</p><p>Oh, and remember how I said that Samsung essentially kept the design the same as the Tab S9 Ultra? That also goes for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card slot</a>, which is a welcome inclusion on any device, let alone one that can serve as a gaming and media playback behemoth.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-5" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom via Sudachi with the GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Giant monitors and trackpads aside, my Tab S10 Ultra usually resides in DeX mode. I don't really have much reason to ever go back to "regular" Android because it's all icky and annoying there. Well, at least for tablets of this size.</p><p>With Google finally working on a proper desktop mode for Pixel devices, it only further drives the point home that certain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablets</a> should default to DeX mode out of the box. And if doesn't want to do it for every tablet, the Tab S Ultra should be the first.</p><p>The traditional Android experience still doesn't work well on tablets or even foldable phones. App scaling is weird; apps don't play nice when going beyond the confines of a narrow rectangle, and sometimes even the interface just looks odd. DeX solves most of those problems with a little help from One UI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="afJDKZtkLTawmas8tyDAZR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-14" alt="iPad Pro M4 next to Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with keyboard cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/afJDKZtkLTawmas8tyDAZR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It makes total sense for Samsung to just embrace the idea of the Tab S Ultra providing a Microsoft Surface experience, powered by One UI and Android. However, this leads me to another issue that I was hoping it would solve but has yet to do so.</p><p>Samsung needs to "borrow" Apple's iPad Pro Magic Keyboard design.</p><p>I applaud the company for making it so you can use the Tab S9 Ultra cases with the newer model. Technically, there are two "new" keyboard cases that launched alongside the Tab S10 Ultra. But the only real difference is the addition of the Galaxy AI key next to the arrow keys.</p><p>Unfortunately, you have a tablet that can double as a laptop, but it's arguably one of the most uncomfortable "laptops" that you'll ever use. With the Book Cover Keyboard, everything works fine, but try using it with your Tab S10 Ultra on your lap, and you'll immediately want to pull out your hair.</p><p>The Book Cover Keyboard Slim is slightly better, as it's a bit more rigid than its counterpart. However, you miss out on the trackpad, which is fine in some instances but isn't the ideal experience for everyone.</p>

<p>Whenever I get a new Android device, whether it's a phone, tablet, or gaming handheld, the first thing I try to do is see how well it can handle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulation</a>. Most modern devices can handle up to PS2 games fairly easily. The <em>real</em> test is seeing how well Switch emulation performs.</p><p>That's where my first annoyance about the move to MediaTek came to mind when I heard the rumors. Graphics drivers for MediaTek devices are... well... they just don't quite stack up to Qualcomm. They'll easily handle systems with mature emulators, but once you start getting into Switch and Windows emulation, it's an entirely different story.</p><p>I won't bore you with the details, but basically, Qualcomm devices allow for the use of custom driver support and Vulkan extensions. If you ever hear about "Turnip" drivers, these are custom-compiled drivers that are used in a variety of emulators, including Switch, 3DS, PS Vita, and others.</p><p>These drivers can offer improved compatibility along with increased performance, which sounds great! Until you learn that you won't be able to use these custom drivers with MediaTek's Mali drivers. This ultimately means that if you try to emulate one of your favorite Switch games only to see that it gets between 10-15fps, you're simply out of luck.</p>

<p>There's one more thing about the Tab S10 Ultra that continues to bug me. For whatever reason, Samsung's "Ultra" tablet isn't available with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/does-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-support-5g">cellular connection</a>. This has bugged me for the last few iterations, but after learning that those in Europe can choose between having Wi-Fi or cellular, I was hopeful that the S10 Ultra might be a deviation from that pattern.</p><p>Sure, it's not a problem with the Galaxy S10 Plus, so if you really want mobile connectivity, that's still an option. But what about those of us who prefer the larger display? Especially considering that the S10 Ultra is essentially a super-sized and Android-powered Surface Pro.</p><p>I understand that it would only make this already-expensive device cost even more. But at the same time, I don't understand Samsung's rationale when it comes to limiting or holding features from its "Ultra" devices.</p>

<p>For the first time in a few years, I feel like there's some real competition in the higher-end Android tablet space. While nothing else can really match up in terms of the display, there are now options that can keep up with Samsung's flagship tablets.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> is the first that comes to mind, simply because of how much of an improvement it is over the previous model. We have the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, a gorgeous 3K LCD panel (which is great for PWM), and Open Canvas offers a different take on multitasking. Plus, even if you decide to pick up the Stylo 2 and Smart Keyboard, it will still cost you less than the Tab S10 Ultra.</p><p>It's a similar story, at least on paper, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovos-trio-of-new-tablets-have-something-for-everyone">Lenovo Yoga Tab Plus</a>. This was announced at CES 2025 and has flown under the radar a bit, but maybe that will soon change. Lenovo, too, opted against going with the Snapdragon 8 Elite but instead relies on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. You'll also enjoy a 12.7-inch 3K display with a 144Hz refresh rate and 16GB of RAM. Lenovo includes both a stylus and a detachable keyboard in the box.</p><p>Last but certainly not least is the big elephant in the room, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review" target="_blank">Apple's iPad Pro</a>. It has everything you could want from a laptop replacement — a big and vibrant screen, an excellent keyboard, and you can even get cellular if you want. However, the biggest caveat is that it's running iPadOS, and while that might be great for some, I still wish Apple would give us macOS on this hardware.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the biggest tablet that money can buy</li><li>You want a tablet that can replace your laptop</li><li>You're already entrenched in the Samsung ecosystem</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget</li><li>You want a tablet with cellular connectivity</li><li>You don't need a screen this massive</li><li>You want to enjoy retro emulation and need the best compatibility</li><li>You already have the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</li></ul>
<p>Frankly, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra isn't for everyone. That statement would be true even if we had the Snapdragon 8 Elite or 8 Gen 3 over the Dimensity 9300+. It's cumbersome to use as a traditional tablet, even though the 14.6-inch display is perfect for media consumption and playing games.</p><p>If you were to ask me for a recommendation, I'd probably tell you to just get the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus. With the extra money saved, you could spring for more storage or grab one with cellular connectivity. However, even that opens another can of worms when you look around at competing tablets with a similarly-sized screen.</p><p>That being said, there's a reason we chose this as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/android-central-best-of-2024-chromebooks-tablets">best tablet of 2024</a>. There's nothing quite like having a device of this size powered by Android. If you do decide to pick up the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, I highly recommend enabling DeX as soon as you get everything set up. It just makes more sense than being confined to the traditional Android UI.</p>

<hr>
<p>Some Google Maps users are running into a weird issue where their entire Timeline history is disappearing. No one’s sure why, but many suspect it has something to do with Google’s recent move to store location history directly on devices instead of in the cloud.</p><p>Google Maps' Timeline feature has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-gets-rid-of-another-feature-on-web">undergone a major shift in how it handles location history</a>. For years, all that data was stored centrally, tied to your account. But starting in December of last year, Google made a big switch, meaning your movement history now stays on your phone instead of Google’s servers.</p><p>The company is giving users until June 9, 2025, to switch over to on-device location history. After that, anything still stored in the cloud will be gone for good.</p><p>Google’s push to decide what to do with years of location history left a lot of users sweating. With a deadline looming, people had to figure out how to save their data before it was too late. Now, some users are finding their Timeline history has vanished into thin air even before the deadline arrives.</p><p>Users are sounding the alarm on Reddit (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1j5l70a/timeline_disappeared/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1j5bjps/timeline_deleted/" target="_blank">2</a>) about disappearing Google Maps Timeline data, and the issue is picking up steam, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/google-maps-timeline-missing/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. In just the past day, tons of people have chimed in, saying their Timeline history has mysteriously vanished too.</p><p>People are reporting that years of their location history have suddenly vanished without a trace. Even though their Timeline is enabled, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> is showing the same frustrating message across the board: "No visits for this day."</p><p>To make matters worse, some users can’t even access their cloud backups anymore.</p><p>Some are pointing fingers at Google Maps’ shift to move location history from the cloud to your device as the likely culprit. The change was supposed to beef up privacy, but it might be causing this mess instead.</p><p>So far, the problem hasn’t popped up on our devices, which suggests it might not be hitting everyone. We’ve reached out to Google for answers and will update this story as soon as we hear back.</p>

Samsung, Google, and Apple have all been implementing AI on their smartphones in a way that feels disjointed. Some features are better than others, and some are genuinely useful. However, it's tricky to describe Google AI, Galaxy AI, or Apple Intelligence as a unified experience.</p><p>After more than a year of sitting on the sidelines, Nothing is debuting its mobile AI with Nothing OS 3 on the Nothing Phone 3a series. It notably chose to work on these AI concepts instead of building the flagship Phone 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">and I criticized that move</a>. More than six months later, the move might have paid off because the Essential Space on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a> is arguably my favorite AI feature so far — and I've tried them all.</p><p>Essential Space is the hub for AI features in Nothing OS, and it's designed specifically for the Phone 3a series. Both the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro have the Essential Key, which is a hardware button that lets you immediately save things to your Essential Space. It works anywhere in the operating system and can serve as a "memory" for things you do on your phone.</p><p>Nothing might've deserved more faith in the first place because it's impressive to see in hindsight how similar Essential Space sounds compared to Nothing CEO Carl Pei's teasers from June 2024. "It’s important we get the product right, integrating hardware and AI in a way that is both useful and brings a smile to people’s faces," Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/getpeid/status/1798369533889302576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1798369533889302576%7Ctwgr%5Eada3b2445a5f9d380c7d3cf95196b4d22c359f66%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fnothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>With a hardware Essential Key and an AI-based Essential Space, the Nothing Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro seem to have delivered on the company's promises.</p>

<p>So, the Essential Space is like an AI "memory" for your smartphone. If that goal sounds familiar, it should. It's the same ambitious feat other AI features like Pixel Screenshots and Microsoft Recall tried to achieve.</p><p>In practice, those tools aren't really serving as your smartphone's memory. They're more like record-keepers. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> will organize your screenshots, but it's on you to remember why you wanted to screenshot what you captured in the first place. So, the app becomes like the screenshots folder in your phone's gallery app — a wasteland for old and forgotten screen saves.</p><p>Unlike those offerings, Essential Space sets itself apart by doing more in one place. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">my hands-on with the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a>, I described Essential Space as being similar to a hybrid of Pixel Screenshots, Pixel Recorder, and Keep Notes. Those are some of my favorite apps on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, but I never knew I needed them to be more tightly integrated until I used the Nothing Phone 3a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rTWE6YhWSZMUcsNMXRiCuB" name="Essential-Key-Record" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rTWE6YhWSZMUcsNMXRiCuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can take a screenshot with the Essential Key by clicking it once and quickly add a text note or a voice note right there. This helps me chronicle why I saved something, and it also gives the Essential Space some context as to why it's important. From there, my screenshots will get sorted, notes analyzed, and voice recordings transcribed.</p><p>On a Google Pixel or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, I would've had to use multiple apps to get the same experience. It would've taken a lot longer, too.</p><p>The best part of Essential Space is what it can do on its own <em>after</em> you've taken a screenshot or recorded a note. It'll identify any action items or important details in your saves and can remind you of them later. For example, I added a discount coupon to the Essential Space and got a push notification a day before it was about to expire. On another occasion, I got a reminder to go on my next running workout after I saved a screenshot of the results from my last one.</p><p>To be clear, Nothing's implementation of mobile AI isn't perfect. The Essential Key is poorly designed, as it's too large, too shiny, and positioned too close to the power button. Meanwhile, the Essential Space app could use more features. It's a hub for your Essential Key saves, and only that.</p><p>The app is <em>so close</em> to being my go-to for notes and reminders, but there's no way to create a note, recording, or reminder in the app without using the Key.</p><p>But that's all forgivable because the whole experience works together seamlessly and lives under one roof — the Essential Space app. I can't say the same for Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, and all the independent and disjointed features under those umbrellas.</p>

<p>AI's surge over the past few years has involved companies trying new things, seeing what works and what doesn't, and copying each other. As such, brands like Google and Samsung should take a close watch on what Nothing is doing with the Essential Space. It wouldn't take much for either company to develop something similar for their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>.</p><p>They already have the individual features built, and some of them are better than what Nothing offers. They just haven't figured out how to fit all the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense, and somehow, it seems like Nothing has.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has swapped out the name “Gemini Extensions” for something simpler and snappier: "Apps." Along with the new name, these apps are also getting a boost with a version of Gemini 2.0 that makes them faster and more efficient.</p><p>If you’ve been using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> on your phone or computer lately, you might’ve noticed that the old "Extensions" menu is now called "Apps." Google confirmed the switch in its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/release-notes-03-07-2025.html" target="_blank">Workspace Updates blog</a>.</p><p>Google has made it clear that this name change is just a surface-level update. This means that everything works the same as before, so your experience won’t really change.</p><p>That said, a bit of an adjustment period is inevitable as people get used to the new label. So, if you find yourself pausing for a second to spot the "Apps" menu, you’re not alone—it’ll just take a little time to feel familiar.</p><p>Gemini Apps give Google’s AI chatbot the ability to connect with all sorts of web services and mobile features, going way beyond just answering questions. From pulling up your calendar to summarizing videos or kicking off an audio stream, it’s designed to handle real-time tasks that go beyond basic information lookup.</p><p>Google has fully rolled out the name switch on Android, iOS, and web. You’ll see "Apps" popping up everywhere now, replacing "Extensions" in settings, account menus, and all the main features of the platform.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company is no stranger to renaming and reshuffling its services, but this change seems more intentional. This latest shift feels like a move to make these features feel more like a natural, built-in part of the Gemini ecosystem.</p><p>On top of the name change, Google is rolling out something new under the hood: Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental. Google says it’ll give users a smoother, smarter experience, especially if you’re someone who leans on these tools a lot.</p><p>Google has been steadily evolving its reasoning models. It started with the first release in December, then rolled out an improved version for developers in January. Last month, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-flash-thinking-and-pro-experimental-models-are-hitting-the-gemini-app">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental made its way to all Gemini users</a>, whether you’re on the free plan or paying for premium.</p>

There's a bit of Google in just about every corner at the show, but in the midst of all the excitement on the show floor, I was able to sit with Seang Chau, VP and GM of Android Platform, to discuss what to look forward to in 2025. And while AI underscored nearly everything on the docket, we also dove into Android 16's accelerated timeline and the plan to improve update support across OEMs.</p><p>Improving Android updates across the board seems to be a major focal point for the company this year, from improving the timing of device launches to making it easier for OEMs to support software longer than they traditionally have. And while this may not be as exciting as new Gemini features, getting everyone on the same page with Android updates is just as important, if not more so.</p>

<p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">Android 16 Developer preview</a> commenced, Google announced that it was making a major change to its schedule. Instead of following its usual launch timing, the stable update would launch sooner, specifically in Q2. This means we can expect the update to arrive by June at the latest, putting it months ahead of previous releases.</p><p>When I asked Chau about the accelerated timeline, he said there are multiple reasons why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is coming so much sooner.</p><p>"The first is, we're getting feedback from our OEM partners that 'Hey, the earlier you can release, the more likely we can push new [software] when we launch a new handset in that same year.'</p><p>Because if you look at some of the biggest releases during the year, if we're releasing a new Android version in August or September, it's really hard to release a phone that same year with the latest release, and then you have to wait however many months before you get the latest Android release."</p><p>This was especially true last year when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> launched in August last year without the latest Android release. Even though the phones arrived a bit earlier compared to the previous release, many found it strange that Google waited until <em>after</em> they were released to push <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>.</p><p>Many flagship or sub-flagship launches happen in the second half of the year, which made the timing of previous Android releases tricky. Samsung is one of those companies that launch new phones in July or August, which means they usually come with last year's software before the company launches a beta and eventually the stable version later in the year, <em>usually</em> starting in Q4.</p><p>With Android 16 set to arrive much sooner, this <em>should</em> help companies avoid that awkward launch window after a new update has been released. That means the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> should come with Android 16 out of the box. The new schedule means new phones from other OEMs can get the new software and hopefully be updated sooner.</p>

<p>Chau also notes that another reason the company moved up the Android 16 update is because the company "wanted to be able to move faster with respect to APIs." And while the move is partially AI-driven, he says that, ultimately, it just makes sense.</p><p>"As quickly as the market is moving, and as quickly as our developers need to be able to move in order to build new functionality, especially around AI, we need to make sure that we can add that capability and those APIs multiple times a year.</p><p>So, in order to do that, it didn't make sense to release something in August or September, and then, like, a couple months later put out another release with an API update."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.14%;"><img id="kbidJCdCpXnihJvWUTTP3C" name="qualcomm-extends-support-for-updates-on-android-devices-snapdragon-8-elite" alt="Qualcomm 8 years support for phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kbidJCdCpXnihJvWUTTP3C.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="814" height="457" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Updating a phone is one thing, but it's another thing to continue pushing updates for a phone for years after the device is launched. The Pixel made the first major push for extended update support, promising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">seven years of OS upgrades and security updates</a>. Samsung then followed suit with its flagship Galaxy phones.</p><p>But that kind of support hasn't been common in the Android space, and it definitely takes a lot of resources to provide it. This is why the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm-collaborates-with-google-bringing-extended-support-to-certain-android-phones">announcement</a> from Qualcomm and Google is such a big deal, making it easier for OEMs to support their devices for up to eight years. That said, while we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-unveils-commitment-to-7-years-of-os-and-security-updates-for-the-magic-series">Honor join the seven-year club</a>, it's ultimately up to OEMs if they want to bring that level of support to devices. Chau says he hopes the move will encourage more OEMs to follow.</p><p>"One of the driving factors around this is sustainability, of course, but really, it's so that you can keep your devices longer. And if you decide to pass that device down or return it, you're able to retain more [secondary market] value." Chau says the hope is that longer support for devices will help drive more adoption of Android phones, with consumers knowing their devices will remain secure for years to come.</p><p>In fact, this is partially what drove some long-term Pixel users that I know to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/convincing-friends-ditch-older-pixels-buy-google-pixel-6a">upgrade from their Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 devices</a> after support ended for them. Though they were intrigued by the affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-review">Pixel 6a</a>, they eventually pulled the trigger when the Pixel 7 launched with improved update support (which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-confirms-the-pixel-6-pixel-7-and-pixel-fold-will-get-two-extra-android-os-upgrades">since been extended</a> by another two years), especially since they were not planning to upgrade again for a while.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jdiK7Q7ghKH8DTyU9CzbRL" name="Google-Pixel-7-Pro-hazel-camera-module.jpg" alt="Holding the hazel Google Pixel 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdiK7Q7ghKH8DTyU9CzbRL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google's Pixel phones have arguably the best software update policy, and now, that level of support can be extended to other devices, although it wasn't without its challenges.</p><p>"One of the biggest barriers was SoC support," Chau notes, highlighting that the transition to Tensor SoC helped bring that level of commitment to Pixel phones.</p><p>"One of the challenges, of course, is Linux as the underlying operating system. The long-term support period for different versions of Linux kernels was actually shortened. So, we had to work with the SoC vendors and our partners to make sure that we could actually upgrade the kernel." He notes that this has been very difficult in the past, which highlights the importance of this new collaboration with Qualcomm.</p><p>For now, the eight years of support is supported on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, which powers today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. However, this will also extend to future 8-series chips as well as future 7-series chips, which are expected later this year.</p><p>What's more, Qualcomm notes that this support can lower costs for OEMs interested in adding extended software support for their phones. As someone who loves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, I hope this means the company <del>can</del> will add better (and faster) support to its newer devices.</p>

<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-1-gives-us-a-sneak-peek-at-live-updates">Android 16 still in beta</a>, Chau wasn't able to talk about what we can expect from the stable update later this year, but he did note that despite some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">rhetoric around extended update support</a>, Google is focused on making each update better than the last and making things more efficient.</p><p>"We've promised seven years of updates on Pixel, and we worked with Qualcomm to get to eight years. I see a lot of sentiment, shall we say, like 'Who cares about eight years because it's going to make it worse' and all these other things. We're really working hard to make sure that that's not the case.</p><p>Every release, we want to make sure it is better than the last one, including performance, battery life, etc."</p><p>Chau recognizes that some features will require more power, which is par for the course when it comes to updates. We recently saw this in action with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">features that require the new Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for AI processing, which aren't available on previous models. It's also just as common with Pixels due to more powerful chips being able to handle more power-hungry tasks.</p><p>Still, Chau says Google tries to offset this by finding gains elsewhere, which can sometimes mean a bump in performance when a new update rolls around, even if a feature or two are sacrificed due to a lack of power.</p><p>Ultimately, the question becomes, "How do we make the releases better so that we're not making your phone worse?"</p><p>Fortunately, with the new Android 16 release schedule and a promise to help OEMs update their phones longer (and hopefully faster), 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal moment for Android updates.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-127">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>New Google Photos API changes are cutting off automatic syncing for some digital photo frames like Aura and Cozyla.</li><li>Starting March 17, Aura users will need to manually add photos, and Cozyla users are in the same boat.</li><li>Google announced these changes last September, and they officially take effect on March 31.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s recent changes to how third-party apps can access Google Photos have thrown a wrench into things, causing headaches for a bunch of digital photo frame makers.</p><p>For years, digital photo frame companies have used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>’ tools to easily pull in your pictures and keep them updated. But now, thanks to some recent tweaks to those tools, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623306/google-photos-digital-photo-frame-auto-sync-going-away" target="_blank">The Verge</a> reported, those handy connections are getting cut off, leaving a few digital photo frames in the lurch.</p><p>Google’s updates to its Photos API were meant to boost user privacy, but they’ve also disabled automatic syncing for some devices, like Aura and Cozyla frames. This means those once-smooth slideshows of your favorite pet album won’t update like they used to.</p><p>Before the API changes, Aura’s app let users browse their Photos library and pick what to display on their digital frames. The ‘auto-add’ feature made it even easier by automatically syncing new photos to selected albums.</p><p>However, starting March 17, Aura is pulling the plug on its automatic Google Photos sync, as Senior Director of Communications Jenisse Curry confirmed. That means you’ll have to manually upload photos through the Google Photos app if you want to share new pictures with family on your Aura frame.</p><p>Cozyla is jumping on the same bandwagon and ditching its Google Photos auto-sync too, as per a Reddit thread. So, if you’re rocking a Cozyla frame, get ready to switch to manual uploads for your photo updates.</p><p>Google first unveiled the news about its Photos API changes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/photos/support/updates" target="_blank">back in September</a>, and now it's finally rolling out on March 31. According to Google, the updates aim to beef up user privacy.</p><p>While Google is phasing out this beloved feature, the tech giant is also working on new ways to let devices securely access your Photos library. Interestingly, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/326122731/more-eligible-devices-for-ambient-displays" target="_blank">recently hinted</a> at expanding Google Photos integration to more devices, like smart fridges and newer digital photo frames.</p><p>Google isn’t ditching digital photo frames altogether, but with backend changes in the works, existing frames could face some temporary or even long-term hiccups. The full details are still under wraps, so it’s a wait-and-see situation.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a capable mid-range gaming laptop; you've liked other Chromebook or Acer options in the past; you want a laptop with a large, vivid screen featuring a high enough refresh rate for fast-paced gaming.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer a small keyboard and would be willing to sacrifice display size; you're looking for a laptop that includes a touch display.</p><p>The Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE is a powerful laptop, and Android Central's first pick in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook#section-best-for-gaming">best Chromebook for gaming </a>category.

It also sports an impressive battery life and performance that users love.</p><p>The Intel Core 5 120U backs solid performance for the price point, and this particular model features 8GB of RAM, though the laptop can also be upgraded to 16GB. As for connectivity, the Plus 516 GE includes two USB-C ports, an HDMI port, an ethernet port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>While it is a great pick, it's also worth noting that it isn't a premium gaming laptop, just a good Chromebook for gaming purposes.

However, I'd go so far as to say that there is <em>one</em> company Google should license its technology, and it's not Samsung.</p><p>Despite releasing the first phone with an on-device assistant, Apple sat back and watched as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa quickly surpassed Siri. While minor tweaks and "improvements" have been made over the years, Siri isn't anywhere near as reliable or valuable as Assistant and now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. It reached a tipping point with iOS 18, as Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-gemini-and-other-ai-models-could-come-to-iphones-in-the-future">announced</a> it would be partnering with OpenAI to bring an enhanced version of Siri.</p><p>In addition to providing easy access to ChatGPT, Apple also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-one-ui-7-update-has-me-worried">stated</a> that Siri would offer Personalized Responses and On-Screen Awareness. Those features were already supposed to have been available, but Apple continues to struggle to get them out of the gate. Not only that, the "real" Siri upgrade might not be released for at least another year, if not longer.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It might not be until 2027 before Apple releases the Siri overhaul that the iPhone needs. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This version of Siri is expected to be more akin to what we have with Google Gemini on Android. It's expected to be more conversational, along with actually performing tasks the same way that Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLM models do. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-02/apple-siri-compared-with-alexa-m4-macbook-air-and-ipad-air-2025-coming-soon-m7rn2k2y">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg</a> reports that this is initially expected to debut at WWDC 2025 before being rolled out this time next year.</p><p>Meanwhile, a rumor recently surfaced claiming that Google would introduce an all-new AI assistant named '<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-to-debut-with-ai-powered-pixie">Pixel Sense</a>,' which would essentially be the all-encompassing digital assistant that we've been waiting for. Instead of relying on different apps or "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15146780?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">Gemini Gems</a>," Pixel Sense is expected to leverage and process any of the user data that it's allowed to collect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="a3D2nGkMCfqSmhzostRA5d" name="visual-intelligence-iphone-16-pro-1.jpeg" alt="Apple Visual Intelligence on iPhone 16 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3D2nGkMCfqSmhzostRA5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2268" height="1276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given Apple's consistent struggles and delays in developing its own AI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai might want to consider calling up Apple CEO Tim Cook and saying, "Hey, we can help you with that." It's not like Google isn't already helping out, as Apple's Visual Intelligence already leans on Google for its results, basically implementing Google Lens with Apple's UI.</p><p>I'm not suggesting this just because I use an iPhone. If I want the best, I just reach into my other pocket and grab my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. I think Google would be well-served to try and get this in front of as many people as it can.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Exu6T9MJe5QJVwJHQ8puM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-13" alt="Gemini showing a Rick Astley video on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Exu6T9MJe5QJVwJHQ8puM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is constantly talking about how it wants to continue improving Gemini and AI. It's partially why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series is packed with so many Gemini-powered features while other features make their way to the broader Android market. However, if Google wants to make the biggest impact, serving up Gemini on the iPhone is the best way I can think of.</p><p>It's not like iOS doesn't already have the foundation to make something like this possible. With iOS 18, Apple added "Extensions," which is how you are able to access ChatGPT when asking Siri a question that it can't answer. So, it's not entirely inconceivable that we could see a similar implementation.</p><p>As it currently stands, there's a dedicated Gemini app on the Apple App Store after it was initially integrated into the Google app. There was even a recent update that introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-iphones-slight-rework-lock-screen-apple-update">Gemini lock screen widgets</a>, making it even easier for you to talk to Gemini. However, even a lock screen widget won't be enough for some, as you might not think about it when you're in a hurry or prefer using the Side Button to invoke Siri.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8" name="google-gemini-lock-screen-widgets-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini lock screen widgets on iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is expected to launch this new AI as a "Pixel 10 exclusive." And while I understand the desire to keep features tied to specific devices for a period of time, Google could still choose to expand it beyond the Pixel and Android ecosystem.</p><p>Barring any hiccups, we could see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> launched in August, with the iPhone 17 landing in September. That gives Google about a month of exclusivity for Pixel Sense before the two companies make some type of surprise announcement. Or instead of making Pixel Sense available on launch day for the iPhone, wait a month or two (probably after the holiday shopping rush) and release it as part of Apple's pre-Christmas/New Year break iOS update.</p><p>Then again, maybe the reason why we don't have a Gemini extension for iOS already is because it could likely spell the end of the Pixel line. What's the point in buying a Pixel if you can get the same experience on an iPhone?</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the last three days, Meta has published three in-depth explainers about how its upcoming Meta Orion glasses work, focused on its custom silicon chips, holographic waveguides, and wireless compute puck. It's a refreshing change of pace to see Meta let its engineers be so geekily passionate about their work.</p><p>Meta's Reality Labs team leaked a lot of information about future Quest headsets and AR glasses until Meta started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-issues-a-stern-warning-to-employees-about-leaks" target="_blank">issuing anti-leak warnings to staff</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/labor/621059/meta-fires-20-employee-leakers" target="_blank">firing accused leakers</a>.</p><p>The tech world has always been hyper-fixated on secrecy while despising whistleblowers, leaving its biggest fans dependent on unreliable leaks and fake rumors as they wait for new products. By the time a product launches, the waters are muddied by leaks with incomplete or exaggerated information, making a device look worse before the engineers are allowed to explain the context.</p><p>So that's what makes Meta's current approach with Meta Orion so refreshing. Yes, this is a public proof-of-concept of Reality Labs' work rather than a marketable product, but by eking out information about these glasses <em>now</em> instead of waiting until 2027, it helps inform the public on the challenges of AR glasses engineering and why they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">spending billions on research</a> to address them.</p><p>Whether you're an old "Glasshole," a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> owner waiting for an upgrade, or a Quest fan curious about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-billions-of-ai-glasses-worldwide-is-that-possible">AI glasses</a> in general, I highly recommend you read Meta's three blog posts for yourself. But I'll summarize the highlights below.</p>

<p>In Meta's blog post, titled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/orion-custom-silicon-chips-ip-blocks-accelerators-ar-algorithms-energy-efficiency-reality-labs/" target="_blank"><strong>How Our Custom Silicon & Chips Are Revolutionizing AR</strong></a>, Meta explains why its AR glasses are "completely dependent" upon custom silicon instead of mobile-style chipsets.</p><p>"The glasses form factor can only dissipate so much heat, and it can only accommodate so much battery capacity," the post explains. So "if you hold constant the thermal and battery capacities, the only way to deliver a given experience is to optimize the silicon."</p><p>Director of SoC Solutions Robert Shearer explains that they had to "reduce power consumption by a factor of 100" before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> glasses would work.</p><p>Some of that came down to the wireless puck, but even that required "custom compression protocols to reduce bandwidth and power consumption as data moved from the compute puck to the display, says Director of Product Management Neeraj Choubey. He also described how they used machine learning to reduce the power needed for on-glasses eye and hand tracking.</p><p>The post proceeds to explain how this team also designed the custom silicon in the Orion microLED displays. Display Architecture Technical Director Mike Yee explains how they had to reduce the gap between pixel centers from "tens of microns" on phones to "the single digits," which would only work on silicon.</p><p><em>Then,</em> they needed to develop a "custom power management chip" that fit in the "tiny corner" of Orion's displays to power the holographic content.</p><p>This only scratches the surface of the blog post, which is mostly a platform for this team to brag about how they're "breaking free from traditional mental models" to make custom silicon. But considering the years of reports about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-laying-off-reality-labs-employees-behind-custom-silicon">Meta laying off this team</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-mediatek-announce-partnership-custom-ar-silicon">relying on MediaTek</a> for its silicon, I'd say they deserve some time in the spotlight.</p>

<p>The post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/orion-silicon-carbide-waveguides-ar-glasses-large-field-of-view/" target="_blank"><strong>Our Silicon Carbide Waveguides & the Path to Orion’s Large FoV</strong></a> explains how Meta took advantage of a surplus of silicon-carbide material made for EV cars to make it a "viable option for AR glasses" because of its "high refractive index."</p><p>Optical Scientist Pasqual Rivera says traditional glass lenses make AR glasses an unsightly rainbow "disco." Silicon carbide was initially so "nitrogen-doped" that it was too dark to ever be used for glasses, but Meta's team realized that it's a "total game changer" with incredible clarity when it's not optimized for cars.</p><p>AR Waveguides Tech Lead Giuseppe Calafiore explained how they had to stack multiple glass plates to hit a refractive index of 1.8, making glasses "prohibitively large and ugly." So they tried different materials and eventually settled on silicon carbide, which can hit a 2.7 index with a single plate for better "etendue," aka 50% better light spread for a wider field of view (FoV).</p><p>The post explains that wider FoV on AR glasses can cause "ghost images and rainbows" but that silicon carbide has properties to reduce them, as well as better thermal conductivity.</p><p>That said, the problem is undoubtedly price. Meta's post concludes with Director of Research Science Barry Silverstein saying, "We’re seeing signs that it’s possible to significantly reduce the cost," but that implies that for now, AR glasses either have to settle for worse materials or cost an arm and a leg for a functional display.</p>

<p>The third blog post about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/orion-compute-puck-reality-labs-next-computing-platform" target="_blank"><strong>Orion's computing puck</strong></a> explains why Meta quickly abandoned the idea of using a phone to power its glasses because "demanding performance requirements would drain the phone battery and suck away compute capacity from phone use cases."</p><p>It then goes behind the scenes on how they envisioned the puck as a fully functional controller for AR games with 6DoF sensors and haptics, but that they've turned off those functions for the final version to focus more on eye/hand tracking and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">EMG band</a>. Still, one could imagine enthusiasts and devs getting those functions working if they wanted to.</p><p>That's partially why I think this blog post isn't just about boasting. It explains to skeptics why they chose a puck instead of a phone, curtails any false rumors about the puck being a controller in the final product, and explains the power demands AR glasses have that necessitate this weight in your pocket.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eWhgi5xoXf4aYK3bkUYjTC" name="meta-orion-hands-on-2024-wrist-band-03" alt="Going hands-on with Meta Orion smartglasses and using an EMG wristband for input" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWhgi5xoXf4aYK3bkUYjTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And <em>that</em> brings me back to my original point: I want more companies to let their engineers geek out and explain themselves <em>before</em> products reach the final stage. It primes journalists and hobbyists about the technical side of these products well before launch so they're less reliant on leaks while also building up hype for products and features.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/valve-asus-and-samsung-vr-headsets-fill-niche-that-quest-abandoned">Leaked XR headsets like Valve Deckard</a> have had VR super-nerds pouring over Valve's code for years, looking for hints of what to expect. I'm not saying Valve should reveal its product early, but it's been a long 5+ years since the Index launch with almost nothing VR-related aside from the occasional Steam Link update. Some behind-the-scenes info on what they've been working on would've been a nice nod to its patient fans.</p><p>I doubt Meta will let its engineers loose to talk about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> anytime soon, nor its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">leaked smart glasses</a>. But since we all know these devices are coming, it'd be nice if Meta let loose enough to give us some hints and let engineers brag publicly about their work instead of assuming it can fire everyone until the leaks stop.</p>

This made us think about what exactly the company was thinking while creating these devices.</p><p>For instance, Samsung's claw-like tri-fold, which looks like a flip but would fold on both ends, leaving half an inch of gap in the center. Instead of folding two halves together, this phone folds in two separate sections, which closes the phone like you would close your fist.</p><p>Next up is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">Tecno Spark Slim</a>, which looks cool and is the world's slimmest phone with a 5,200mAh batter, measuring just 5.75mm in thickness. It gets better, at the rear, the camera bar looks like a futuristic robot's eyes, connected by LEDs with unibody ceramic or stainless steel rear panels. Hope you're taking notes, Samsung!</p><p>Xiaomi took accessorizing to another level, with a custom Xiaomi 15 showcased at the event that had a large magnetic ring on its rear that could attach a bigger camera lens, instantly converting your phone into a DSLR camera.</p><p>Some of the other things that the AC team spotted were Honor's AI-powered robotic hand on display that onlookers could interact with, Nubia Focus 2 Ultra, which features a ring around the camera housing that can be physically rotated to control the zoom, UAE's Humanoid robot that kinda creeped them out and more.</p>

<p>How much should anyone be paying for a phone case? The question is highly debatable, but I'm sure you've asked yourself this before. After all, smartphone cases these days range from as low as $10 or maybe even less and can go all the way past the $100 mark.</p><p>I know it sounds insane to spend $100 or more on a phone case. For a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap phone that costs about $500</a>, that's already a major fraction of the price of the device itself! As ridiculous as it may seem to be, sometimes it's actually worth the splurge. There are many reasons why you'd want such an expensive phone case.</p><p>But before dishing out my own opinions, I'd like to share what others have told me regarding the matter. I went around asking my colleagues how much they were <em>willing</em> to spend on a case on average. Their like-minded answers highlighted a pattern in buying phone cases.</p>
<h2 id="what-most-people-prefer-to-spend-on-cases-2">What most people prefer to spend on cases</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4288px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9k8m9gWc3LBYZtbig2ZjJ6" name="Dbrand Grip Case for Pixel 7 Pro in Camo Glitch - 1.JPG" alt="Dbrand Grip Case for Pixel 7 Pro in Camo Glitch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9k8m9gWc3LBYZtbig2ZjJ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4288" height="2412" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked Android Central writers how much they'd be willing to spend on a phone case. Here's what some of them had to say on the matter. Phones editor Nicholas Sutrich says his max is $20 "unless it's something really special like a Thinborne." Android Central contributor Tshaka Armstrong had a similar response, saying he'd spend about "$20-ish on Amazon but much more if it’s a brand I trust AND the case has design elements and materials that justify the higher price."</p><p>Meanwhile, news editor Nandika Ravi says she'd spend "Anywhere between $50 to $60 at the most."</p>
<p>Typically speaking, most of Android Central's staff find it appropriate to spend about $20 on an everyday phone cover. The only exceptions come in when a notable brand is involved.</p><p>Why is there an exception when a popular brand comes into play? According to the vox populi, it's all about the build quality and reliability of the brand. Trustworthy phone case makers ensure your phone cover is made of the highest grade materials and actually delivers on the drop protection promises made.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I once paid for an official leather case and realized my running lifestyle made it a waste: it got sweat-stained and ruined, so I had to replace it after a few months. Now, I try to keep it simple. I do pick the more reputable companies, but I wouldn’t pay above $40.</p><figcaption><cite>Michael L Hicks, Senior Editor, Wearables & AR/VR</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>When a name brand is involved, most members of our team — and probably the general public — are willing to stretch their budget to a certain extent.</p>
<h2 id="why-brands-matter-2">Why brands matter</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="P23QYiTSYmXRmnZHu8xtqg" name="Peak-Design-Case-MagSafe-Comparison.jpg" alt="MagSafe accessories on an iPhone and Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P23QYiTSYmXRmnZHu8xtqg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Can you get a cheap case from retailers like Amazon? Yes, of course you can. However, the issue arises with no-name brands selling poor-quality silicone, low-grade TPU, or faux leather phone covers, touting them to be "military-grade drop-resistant" when the truth is far from it.</p><p>This is exactly why brands matter and why some folks are willing to spend up to $60 on a protective case for their smartphone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Name brands have a reputation at stake and a face to save.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Name brands have a reputation at stake and a face to save. If a company like Spigen promises 20ft drop protection, you know that a research & development team actually put the phone cover to the test. It's no wonder an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/spigen-case-saves-iphone-from-16000-foot-fall">iPhone survived a 16,000ft fall from a moving airplane in a Spigen case</a>.</p><p>Let's not forget about the insanely slim yet incredulously rugged Arc Pulse case for the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Sutrich doubted the structural integrity of such a minimalist Pixel 9 case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-arc-pulse-case-impressions">in his review</a>, but then he dropped it on concrete. This eye-wateringly expensive phone case will set you back $90, but you'll also get the satisfaction of knowing it can live through anything.</p><p>Thus, when a brand like CASETiFY promises impact-proofing on its bumper covers, you can rely on the case to be that tough in actuality. Because if it isn't so, unsatisfied customers know where to find them and how to shame them, perhaps going as far as suing for false advertisement.</p><p>Good luck trying to do any of that with the $3 knock-off you got from Temu. Accountability is non-existent in that scenario.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line-2">The bottom line</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D3KvosfDFfgMsrTjZc9A9Y" name="Tudia-cases-nothing-phone-2-honor-magic-6-pro-boox-palma-02.jpg" alt="Tudia cases for the Onyx Boox Palma, Nothing Phone 2, and Honor Magic 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3KvosfDFfgMsrTjZc9A9Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's where I pipe in with my own thoughts. I've been covering phone accessories for several years now, so I can positively reassure you. Brands are important, but that doesn't mean you need to spend $100 for a functional and sturdy phone case.</p><p>Plenty of awesome brands are also accessibly priced. Just look at Spigen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tudia-phone-cases-stock-up">TUDIA</a>, TORRAS, and ESR, to name a few. Even their flagship phone cases for Samsung and Google are priced around $20 or less. I could go on and on, but my point has been made.</p><p>Names like these are proof that a tight budget doesn't automatically compromise the quality of the phone case you can afford.</p><p>At the end of the day, buy a phone case from a reliable brand that fits your budget. It doesn't matter if it's $15 or $150. As long as you do your research on the brand's history, you'll be solid.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a's release may be just around the corner, and while we anticipate learning more about the phone — several leaks have been coming in hot.</p><p>The most recent one gave us a good look at how the alleged hardware and design of the device. Coming from avid tipster<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1897836775290085404" target="_blank"> Evan Blass</a> are what seem to be official marketing images of the Pixel 9a. In an X (previously Twitter) post, Blass showed off alleged renders of the mid-range phone.</p><p>In terms of the hardware, the Pixel 9a seems to have flat edges, rounded corners, and an end-to-end screen. Additionally, the images confirm what the previous leaks have been pointing towards— the mid-range device could be losing the signature Pixel camera visor. Instead, it will have a pill-shaped housing flush with the rear panel of the phone.</p><p>However, in another image showing the phone horizontally, a sliver of the camera bump seems to exist— indicating that the company may not be letting go of the bump altogether.</p>

<p>As indicated in previous leaks, the Pixel 9a could come in four colorways: Black, silver, pink, and Lilac, but the official names of these colors remain under wraps so far. That said, in the subsequent thread, Blass shows off some of the Gemini's features that could supposedly show up on the Pixel 9a.</p><p>To start, one image shows a person triggering Gemini by holding down the power button. The other images seem to indicate that the phone will come with Android 15's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">anti-theft protection</a> and several cameras, calling, and general Pixel ecosystem features.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-renders-cases-and-fcc-listing-leak" target="_blank">leak that popped up </a>earlier this week indicated that the Pixel 9a could come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-satellite-sos-on-google-pixel">satellite connectivity</a> out of the box. The mid-range phone is said to have shown up for FCC certification with the digital label explaining, "The satellite feature on this device must be turned off at all times while on board an aircraft by turning on airplane mode," which is similar to what showed up on the flagship model as well.</p><p>It is important to note that several features that show up in leaks may or may not make it to the actual device. However, here's a detailed list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">what we expect</a> to see from the upcoming Google Pixel 9a.</p>
